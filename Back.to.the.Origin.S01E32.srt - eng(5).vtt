Xiaohe.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.840
Anran wants to see you right now.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.600
I thought I was getting fired.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.720
What does she want now?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.720
But you're doing just fine.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.880
Why would she fire you?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.400
[Xiaohe.]

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.720
[My anxiety issue]

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.960
[is spread all over the company.]

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.440
[You were]

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.280
[the only one who knew.]

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.600
[How could you do this?]

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.640
[They're gossiping about me behind my back,]

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.280
[laughing at me.]

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.000
[I treated you]

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.240
[like family this whole time.]

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.440
[I've been taking care of you,]

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.280
[protecting you,]

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.040
[sheltering you from harm.]

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.920
[How could you]

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.520
[repay me like this?]

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.480
Yudong, it's 7 P.M.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.240
Zhang Ran.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.040
The live stream.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.520
Why not go home to watch?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.440
What's the point?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.400
Watching on my phone is the same.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.120
Besides, even if I go home,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.120
Zhang Ran just ignores me.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.920
I'm better off in her live room.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.520
Throw her a tip every now and then,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.760
and she might even say something to me.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.040
Say what?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.960
"Thanks, bro."

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960
So you're her

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.560
top tipper?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.400
You got nothing to do.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.000
Why not go home?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.960
Now I get home

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.120
promptly at ten every night.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.600
Cheng Man's asleep by then.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.680
And neither of us

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.320
has to talk to the other.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.160
It's nice.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.520
No drama.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.240
Come on, it's not that bad.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.760
Just because you argued

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.320
about the kid's school stuff?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.800
Why did you say you liked Cheng Man

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.520
in the first place?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.280
Wasn't it because

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.480
she's worldly?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.000
That she knows how to live?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.920
And you? What did you tell me?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.720
You said you liked Zhang Ran's

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.640
sense of justice.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.280
That fierce way she argues.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.440
And I thought to myself

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.000
why not just marry Conan the Barbarian?

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.800
People change.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.360
Zhang Ran used to be so tough.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.400
And now?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.600
Mimicking cats, dogs, gorillas.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320
What a world.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.279
So we both can't go home right now.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.720
Misery loves company, huh?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.880
[Dancing]

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.200
[really isn't my strong suit.]

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.520
[But, but hey, folks...]

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.080
[Well,]

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.560
[how about this.]

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.040
[Not much of a dancer,]

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.800
[just gonna do a jellyfish dance.]

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.160
Alright, alright.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.320
Music's ready.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.440
[It's all improvisation.]

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.880
[Guys, totally impromptu.]

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.200
[No choreography,]

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.360
no script.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.720
Nothing. Let's go!

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.440
Sorry.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.840
The power just went out.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.000
What now?

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.280
Still doing the PK?

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.720
How can you dance

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.760
in the dark like this?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.520
[It's okay, I can fix this.]

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.360
[Give me a moment, guys.]

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.360
[Not a scripted bit!]

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.360
[Definitely not.]

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.880
[No advance planning at all.]

[It's fine, I'll grab a light.]

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.800
Can you all see me now?

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.520
Is that better?

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080
My family's home.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.920
He can fix this.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.560
See? Luck's on my side.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.320
[I really do want to dance,]

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.440
[but it's just too dark.]

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.640
[You can't see me clearly, right?]

Since she's dancing,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.320
I'll sing a song.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.680
Dancing, singing...

I was wrongfully accused.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.120
Without

and the courage to risk it all,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.080

Well, you're right.

a husband, a family.

and get abused every day.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.440
I often ask myself

if it's worth it.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.920

But honestly? I don't overthink it.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.480
There's just one thing

weighing on my mind,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.120
I just can't let it go.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.760
I'm being straightforward.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.760
Totally honest here.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.000

I'm ambitious

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.840
and vain.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.000
You're right.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.440
That's exactly me.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.200
I am impatient for success.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.040
I am vain.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.240
I want to achieve

what I set out to do.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680
In fact, I was so close

to success.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.720

I was there, wasn't I?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.960
But it ended as soon as it started.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:50.880
It's like

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.040
having a sweet dream

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.880

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.120
about to make

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.680
a fortune,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.720
and then I woke up.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.640
That's exactly how I feel.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.400
So I can't let it go.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.120
Because all the effort I put in

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.160
was real.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.920
So I told myself

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.400
I'll

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.760
surrender a bit later.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.240
Before the final moment

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.040
arrives,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.040
I'll grit my teeth

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.240
and get back up one more time.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.440
If it doesn't work this time,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.560
I'll see if I have any strength left.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.640
If I do, I'll get up again.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.880
That's just how I am.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.480
That's me.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.800
Vain, impatient for success,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.800
won't stop till I get there.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:27.840
It's me.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.840
These are my true feelings.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120
Thank you all so much

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.800
for taking the time

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.800
to listen to me,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.800
and for supporting

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.040
such an imperfect me.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.960
Thanks for all your encouragement.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.120
Thank you, guys.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.120
Thank you!

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600
I floated around

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.240
the acting scene for 4 years.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.360
I also can't let it go.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:48.760
You know what,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.560
in those four years,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.080
I never got a single role

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.160
with actual lines.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.000
So are you thinking

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.880
of giving up now?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.640
I'd say

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.200
don't give up just yet.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.160
Yeah,

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.360
even if you give it one last push,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.280
you might not

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.760
succeed,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.600
but think about

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.360
all that effort you put in.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.680
If you quit now,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.080
you'll lose that drive for good

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.120
when you want to come back to it later.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.680
Doesn't that break you?

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.240
I know my beliefs

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.680
would crumble.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.480
That's why

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.000
I hope you surrender a bit later too.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.680
Give it another try.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.080
So many gifts!

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.400
Oh, Go-Karts!

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.240
Thank you, thank you!

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.160
8867 8867

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.040
Let me say it three times!

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.600
8867

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.440
Thank you for the cake!

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.960
I'll enjoy it, thanks!

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.240
Rocket from "Dreamer".

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.440
Don't tell me you're gonna survive on

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.520
instant noodles for days after this.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.480
Just kidding.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.920
Thank you, "Dreamer".

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.440
Thank you for the big rocket!

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.680
I really should

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.160
screenshot this scene.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:58.560
Is it...

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.600
Is the PK over already?

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.360
Did I win?

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.280
Thank you.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:21.920
Thank you, guys.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.960
This is the first time

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.880
I've won a PK.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.960
Thank you for encouraging me.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.600
See? I told you

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.640
things would get better.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.680
I knew I could win.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.200
I will now, and I will later.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.120
You will too.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.320
One to zero.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.520
Sorry about that.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.320
Lame.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.560
Can't handle losing?

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.640
The first half isn't even over.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.800
Let's go again.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.520
Don't feel like it.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:06.920
What's up?

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.920
You seem a bit down

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.960
today.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.400
How did Lady Wan get famous?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560
Didn't she say?

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.360
Well...

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.480
"Era dividends plus personal struggle."

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.080
From the interview I sent you.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.000
That's the official story.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.960
I want to know if there's

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.480
an easier, faster way.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.320
Why are you asking?

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.360
Ran's

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.880
been working so hard lately.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.200
She's finally making some progress.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.760
I think

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.840
I should do something to help her.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.480
I'll send you a WeChat contact.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.520
Add him.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.520
What does he do?

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.400
I met this guy in

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.280
Lady Wan's fan group before.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.600
He's pretty capable.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.080
He can do anything:

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.680
gain followers, boost data,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.800
get on trending topics...

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.120
Whatever you can imagine,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.920
he can make it happen.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.960
Why don't you buy

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.200
300,000 followers for her?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.400
Just give it a try.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.120
Buy followers?

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.240
Anything can be bought.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.440
The internet is

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.360
about the Matthew Effect, you know?

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.640
The bigger her follower base,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.880
the more likely the platform's algorithm

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.440
will push her to others.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.360
If she has no followers,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.600
nobody pays attention.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:26.480
No.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.840
We can't do that.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.520
Huh, interesting.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.880
You asked for a shortcut,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.760
but now you're against it.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Honestly, you're such

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.680
a walking contradiction.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.800
What's his name?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.880
"Know-It-All Shao."

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.240
Why are there only

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.800
around 30 people in my live room?

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.200
Why isn't anyone joining?

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:10.960
You...

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.920
Did you come from

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.800
my homepage?

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.360
What's going on?

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.320
Seriously, what's happening?

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.840
Why am I throttled?

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.320
What did I do to get throttled?

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.520
300,000 followers.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.440
I spent a fortune on those.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.400
I was just trying to help.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:27.640
Bro,

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.880
stop trying to be helpful,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.240
okay?

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.480
I finally got some traffic,

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.800
and started to make progress.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.840
Can you stop messing with me, bro?

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.080
What's wrong with you?

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.560
Why do you keep calling me bro?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.400
Can those other guys compare to me?

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.520
I'm the best bro you've got.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.840
That guy said even

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.640
Lady Wan bought followers

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.360
from him.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:45.680
First,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.760
that guy might not be telling the truth.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.520
Second,

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.480
time has changed.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.040
Lady Wan's era is past.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.080
You're always holding me back!

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.400
What am I supposed to do now?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.760
So what now?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.560
I'm throttled for three days.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.480
Can't stream at all.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.720
Only three days?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.160
"Only"? You…

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.720
Do you just hate seeing me succeed?

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.560
I only had around

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.040
30 people in my live room.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.920
You suddenly bought me 300,000.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.080
Of course they'd flag me.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.120
I already had no traffic.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.520
Couldn't even get matched for PKs.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.320
Now I have no one to chat with.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:16.920
Who am I gonna talk to?

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.080
Myself?

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.960
Talk to me. I'll keep you company!

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.880
Don't think my three-day break

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.880
gives you an opening,

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.400
you know?

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800
An opening for what?

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.760
To get close? I've been guarding

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.520
an empty nest to support your career.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.480
I'm used to it by now.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.120
I'm practically desireless, okay?

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:30.760
Now, every time I see you,

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.800
I think of a gorilla.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880
I just mimic it well.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.200
That doesn't mean I am one. Got it?

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.800
You're more gorilla than a gorilla.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.400
Gorillas learned from you.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.760
Wanna know what I'll do

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.320
during my three-day break?

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:40.760
What?

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.480
I'll beat you up!

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.240
Come on, try it!

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.840
Come and get me, big ape!

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.160
You're so annoying!

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.640
Get over here!

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.600
Come and get me, big ape!

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.760
Catch me if you can!

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.120
Missed me!

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.280
Be careful.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.880
[Hey, "Moonlit Night",]

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.000
[please think twice before]

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.840
[sending gifts.]

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.240
[Don't wrong yourself for me.]

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.880
Zhang Ran is really

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.760
a cockroach you can't kill.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.800
But it seems she was

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:11.800
throttled recently.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.400
Why's that?

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.640
Apparently bought 300k bot followers.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.880
Clumsy move,

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.119
but commendable courage.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.359
I like her more and more now.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:31.680
So how many

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.720
real followers does she have?

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.520
Not many,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.200
around 3,000.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.560
3,000.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.160
Sounds like a small number,

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.320
but these are all fans

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.080
who've stuck with her through the lows.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.400
Exactly.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.200
So they're a purified,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.960
loyal base.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.040
Keep an eye on her.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.400
Sure, I will.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.520
These are real fans who can be monetized.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.480
I'll get back to work then.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.880
Now she's doing acrobatics too?

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.240
Come on, let's celebrate.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.240
My live room's

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.480
throttling being lifted.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.560
This soda is flat.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.720
Let's celebrate!

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:37.720
Yeah.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.080
So happy.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.920
Thank you! Thank you!

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.720
About that throttling,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.280
it's over.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.120
Let's move on.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.600
It's a long story.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.400
No sabotage or framing.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.520
No, really.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.880
No conspiracy.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.720
Seriously.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.000
My video was

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.160
maliciously edited before,

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.040
but that's

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.200
all in the past now.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.120
Lin Anran...

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.120
Let's not bring up others here.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.720
Okay?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.240
I think

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.600
I should look forward.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.160
Focusing on myself is what matters most.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.520
[Now that I have your support,]

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.840
[I'm so happy.]

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280
[I've been watching]

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.160
[Zhang Ran's streams lately.]

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960
[Liu Bo was right.]

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.240
[As someone who knows the truth,]

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.240
[staying silent]

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.160
[is condoning injustice.]

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.680
[I should, and I'm obligated to]

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.800
[post it online,]

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.160
[let people know the truth.]

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.960
Hello, Bo.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:56.920
Who?

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.560
Oh my god.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.080
Anran, we can't keep up

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.080
with all these comments to delete.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.720
Reached 22 on the trending chart.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.640
Rising too fast, out of control.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.200
Keep deleting!

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.600
I'll hire more trolls.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:42.560
We can only

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.440
push other topics up to cover it.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.240
Then find other topics.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.680
We're out of topics.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.560
I was such a fool.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.280
I was just too kind back then.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.960
I treated her like

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.800
my own little sister.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.640
Even when she made mistakes,

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.760
I never really

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.520
punished her.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.760
Never thought she'd

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.440
bite the hand that feeds her.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.040
Everyone in the company knows

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.120
about my anxiety.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.680
She's the one who spread it.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.680
Even so,

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240
I was just angry,

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:25.960
fired her,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.800
thinking I'd bring her back

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.720
once I cooled down.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.960
Just to teach her a lesson.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.920
And what does she do?

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.600
Turns around and bites me!

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.240
What does she want?

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.920
As her sister, I just

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.080
criticized her a bit.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.160
What's the big deal?

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.880
Why make netizens attack me?

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.280
Put your phones away. Stop filming!

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.400
Stop filming!

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.680
What's wrong?

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.800
Get out!

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.840
What's happening?

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.760
Relax, relax.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.320
Let it out. That's good.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.080
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.560
Relax, relax, relax.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.640
It's okay. Relax, relax.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.360
Inhale, inhale, inhale.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.200
Good, slow down.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.440
Okay.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.080
You have to trust us,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.440
trust Tide Media.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.720
The company is your

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.080
strongest backup.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.960
Don't speak for now.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.080
Just listen to me.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.800
Have some soda.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.520
Dan, the breathing thing,

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.240
what's that called?

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.640
Abdominal breathing.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.440
Abdominal breathing.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.000
Okay.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:57.760
Right.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.040
Just focus on breathing.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.080
And listen to me.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.400
Have some water.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.440
The company has a lawyer

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.680
talking to Xiaohe.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.000
Everything is under control.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.120
The lawyer said

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.400
the video

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.720
she posted

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.560
was recorded secretly.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.720
She is infringing copyright.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.680
Yes.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.760
Legally speaking,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.000
she has to take down the post.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.000
Yeah.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.040
Everything is under control.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.120
Don't worry.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.760
Take a sip of water, easy now.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.360
Slowly.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.000
Easy.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.160
Easy, easy.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.360
Mr. Lin,

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.360
I want to go home.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.560
You can go home now.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.360
What about the day after tomorrow?

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.280
I don't

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.080
wanna do it anymore.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.720
That's still two days away.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.040
In two days,

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.440
you'll definitely feel better.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.040
I won't.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.280
My anxiety has been

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.720
getting worse and worse lately.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.360
You saw

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.960
how I was today.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.880
And it's not

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.080
the first time.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.080
It's not.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.720
Let me show you something.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.160
Anran,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.800
look at this.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.440
The company has found ways

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.560
to cool down the hype.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.160
And pushed positive topics up.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.840
You're the top star at Tide.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.240
I am your strongest backup.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.400
I believe you

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.960
can navigate this storm,

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.040
ride the waves.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:18.840
You can do it.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.480
You just need to push a little harder.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.080
I really can't do

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080
this job anymore.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.480
I'm going home.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.720
We all

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.560
need a little hardship

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.080
to break out of our cocoon.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.720
What doesn't kill you

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.520
makes you stronger.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.360
You always wanna

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.960
get a higher share, right?

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.360
This time, I promise you, at the risk of

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.480
board accountability,

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.680
if you get through this,

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.960
you'll have what you want.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.480
Deal?

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.120
It's not about the money.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.400
Really, it's not.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.000
It actually is about money.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.320
Brands have stocked up on goods,

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.520
paid for link fees.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.960
If you don't stream,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.920
how much will you have to compensate?

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.520
I know you've been through a lot lately.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.280
Go home and rest.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.680
Turn off your phone.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.360
Stay off the internet.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.920
I promise,

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.320
when you're back, all will be well.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.120
You'll be even more famous than now.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.560
Really?

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.920
We'll start the new split

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.360
the day after tomorrow.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.000
Okay?

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.800
Is that okay?

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.000
Yeah.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.360
Can I go home now?

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.440
Dan, see her out.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:12.440
Come on.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.760
Take good care of her.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.800
Let me help you.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.960
Put your shoes on.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.680
Dr. Fu.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.720
You left deep impression

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.320
on my fans.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.200
Lately when I sell skincare products,

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.880
fans still ask

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.400
"When will Dr. Fu come back?"

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.920
All female fans.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.640
So,

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.160
that's why we're here.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.400
Thank you for the invite

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.160
to the Double 11 domestic products special.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.560
We're so excited.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.360
Thank you.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.480
Like you said,

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.480
I enjoy growing

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.160
alongside domestic brands.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.000
Hope we can be of help.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.480
You're a huge help.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.120
Thank you so much.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.800
This time, Lady Wan

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.720
plans to offer you

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.600
five product links.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.600
After we sign

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.680
the initial intent agreement,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.720
I'll follow up with you on

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.400
product selection and bundling.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.040
To be honest,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:57.960
our product prices

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.760
are quite affordable.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.440
If we have to guarantee

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.280
such a high commission rate

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.360
for each product,

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.720
we'll need to stock up

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.600
a huge amount of inventory.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.880
Every brand is eager

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.240
to get into Lady Wan's live room

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.880
for sales volume.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.360
Don't worry.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.320
No matter your stock,

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:15.880
I can sell it all.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.920
I'm not worried about that.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.160
I mean,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.000
we'll need to cover

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.680
a lot of costs in advance.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.520
I'm afraid...

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.720
The Double 11 special

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.600
isn't like the charity one

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.200
we did last time.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.840
We have to get back to

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.000
normal business sense.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.600
The commission rate

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.560
might be high,

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.680
but the money doesn't

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.760
go to just one person.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.240
Our entire team,

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.400
business, customer service,

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.080
live stream crew,

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.440
hundreds of people

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.920
depend on this live room.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.800
Lady Wan really admires you.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.280
She insisted on

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.360
giving you this opportunity.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.840
Of course, we know

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.920
you're a start-up.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.600
If you're hesitant

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.520
about joining this,

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.160
we completely understand.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.160
No concerns at all.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.400
We're definitely in.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.920
We absolutely want to do it.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.560
But

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.000
could we talk about

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.200
some other options for the pricing?

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.160
My fans and I

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.760
really like Dr. Fu.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.160
How about this.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.040
We'll waive the link fee.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.520
That's so generous.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.920
It's a deal.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.400
Let's do it.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.600
Thank you, Lady Wan.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.440
Pleasure working with you!

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.040
You too.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.240
Li Daoqi, what were you thinking?

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.760
You know exactly

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.120
what's in the company account.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.680
Stocking so much goods?

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.600
Raw materials, production, warehousing,

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.120
and logistics. How much will that cost?

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.080
Where's the money coming from?

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:45.840
Seriously,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.040
you can't put in another cent.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.360
Nice one, Yudong.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.440
You can read financial reports now.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.600
Those two were putting on a show,

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.560
can't you tell?

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.280
How terrifying!

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.160
Putting on a show.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.160
Not bad, Yudong.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.800
You even saw through that.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.360
You know what,

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.800
I really think you're

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.840
cut out for business.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.320
If you'd come back earlier,

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.240
you might've made it big by now.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.800
Cut the crap. Tell me,

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.680
what about the money?

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.360
No need to worry.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.120
Xing Kai's got it.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.440
Xing Kai won't pay a cent.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.960
Michael is his guy.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160
And that Michael

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.720
has always been

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.080
against Lady Wan

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:25.880
live stream deal.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.480
That means Xing Kai is too.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.200
They're in this together.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.480
You saw right through them!

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.400
Sharp eyes!

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.640
Xing Kai and Michael,

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.160
no matter how they act,

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.200
they're well aware how vital

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.080
it is to be on Lady Wan's

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.920
Double 11 livestream.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.200
At next week's meeting,

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.040
let's put on a show too.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.400
Help me out.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.120
Let's figure out

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.720
how to get the money from Xing Kai.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.720
Honestly,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.320
it's not that simple.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.520
But it's not that hard either.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.080
Take it easy, okay?

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:09.719
You know what.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:10.719
This is what I call

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.080
negative thinking.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.719
You always tend to

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.480
think of

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.560
the worst-case scenario.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.920
Oh no, are we on

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:19.800
the elevated road?

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:23.040
It's on you.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.600
You were distracting me.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.560
So what now?

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:28.600
Forget it.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.280
Let's go on a day trip.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.239
Enjoy the scenery, clear our minds.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.600
Before your stream,

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.560
can we talk?

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.760
Need your opinion.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.160
Lady Wan agreed

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.160
to let us join

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.600
their Double 11 stream.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.520
Should be great news,

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.360
but when I saw the contract,

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.160
I was shocked.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.600
Now I see why

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.720
so many want

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.520
to be influencers

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.560
and sell live.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.240
One live room like that,

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.040
earns in a night

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.560
almost as much as

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.120
some listed firms'

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.040
yearly revenue.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.520
Yeah, I get it.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.800
Li Daoqi is super confident

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.760
about this,

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.080
but I just feel uneasy.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.040
It feels like a

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.880
big gamble.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.720
What if we lose?

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.720
Is this what doing business is like?

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.920
Why do I feel so insecure?

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.200
Don't worry.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:51.840
I know I shouldn't

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.920
hold us back now,

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.200
but I've been reflecting,

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:55.880
I don't think I'm

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.880
cut out to be a CEO.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.680
And I'm really

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.040
worried about Li Daoqi.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.400
He seems like

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.440
a different person from before.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.360
Whenever we talk about this,

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.560
he's like a gambler

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.920
who's lost his senses.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.960
Was it a mistake

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.920
for me to agree to this

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.080
in the first place?

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.560
Absolutely not!

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:17.680
The company

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.120
trained me from scratch.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.720
Dan, I would never

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.880
sabotage the company

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.160
at a time like this.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.680
I won't do anything.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.120
I mean it, believe me.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.040
Contact me if anything comes up.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:29.960
Goodbye.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:33.800
Xiaohe

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.840
wrote a long post online

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.040
accusing Lin Anran.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.600
She was going to post

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.000
the full version of that video

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.480
we filmed earlier.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.760
It's already up.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.240
Once this is out, I'm cleared.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.160
But Lin Anran is in trouble.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.440
Trending for a day,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.280
getting torn apart.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.120
Qian Dan asked if I could

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.520
avoid mentioning this

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.280
during the live stream.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.040
I said okay.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.280
She's truly the company's top star.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.160
When I was in trouble,

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.480
no one helped me

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.720
cool down the hype.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.400
You've been mumbling.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.000
Were you

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.360
talking to me?

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.880
No, nothing.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.160
Hurry up and eat.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.800
Yeah, just one more bite.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.840
Going for makeup, then live.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:22.720
Don't worry,

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.200
I'll clean up later.

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.840
When do you end stream?

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.720
No set time, might be late.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.840
Sleep if you're tired.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.560
Don't wait up for me.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.800
Hey,

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.000
there's a trending topic today:

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.520
["Everyone owes Zhang Ran an apology."]

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.000
[See it?]

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.280
These kinds of shows

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.040
are complicated.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.600
Hard to explain in a few words.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.680
But I hope

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.080
my viewers

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:05.920
won't

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.200
easily judge

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.240
or attack someone.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.720
Sometimes what you see

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.160
isn't the whole truth.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.320
So please,

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.600
be kind with your words.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.360
Focus more on

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.160
the good things

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.280
in life instead.
