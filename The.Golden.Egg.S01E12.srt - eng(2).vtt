FINAL EPISODE

00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:16.888
A long day for the Sengoku Weekly
Incident Team was about to begin.

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:32.003
An exclusive interview with
the wanted fugitive Kota Kubozuka.

00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:33.371
This way.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.442
Nice to meet you, I'm Kitahama
of the Incident Team.

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:42.046
Please.

00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:48.686
What's wrong?

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:53.124
Mr. Watanabe told me

00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:56.861
there was a woman
who didn't seem to belong at a tabloid.

00:00:56.928 --> 00:01:00.798
That she had clear eyes,
and I could trust her.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.067
Is she not here today?

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:08.640
I think you mean Shinoda, but she's out
looking for Madoka Hashimoto.

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:10.675
What?

00:01:10.742 --> 00:01:14.045
She was with you
while you were evading the police, right?

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.415
How much do you know?

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:19.751
She won't get arrested, right?

00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:22.420
-Don't write about Madoka.
-Don't worry.

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:24.856
She won't be in the article.

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:28.893
We won't be contacting
or handing you over to the police.

00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:35.166
While there are only old men
with jaded eyes here,

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:39.170
in our hearts we just want to help you.

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:43.041
Please, you have nothing to worry about.

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:11.869
Will she show up?

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:15.139
I'm sure she will.

00:02:19.777 --> 00:02:24.182
The first time I met Madoka
was at Seiya Aoshiro's apartment.

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:30.588
Mr. Aoshiro looked after me
when I first came to Tokyo from Niigata.

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:35.760
But one day, some fangirl showed up
wanting a look at Mr. Aoshiro.

00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:38.496
That was Madoka.

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:41.566
You exchanged numbers?

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:42.667
Yes.

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.236
She came all by herself
so she caught my interest.

00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:46.271
By herself?

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:49.140
How did that come to be?

00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:51.809
Well.

00:02:53.544 --> 00:02:57.715
Madoka was attending a seminar
for aspiring models.

00:02:57.782 --> 00:03:02.287
It seems she was close to Harue Komiyama
who she met there.

00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:04.722
And Ms. Komiyama invited her.

00:03:05.323 --> 00:03:08.459
Have you ever met Ms. Komiyama--

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:09.761
No, I haven't.

00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:12.330
So, I'm not acquainted with her at all.

00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:16.000
The day before Ms. Komiyama's body
was discovered in the park,

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:18.303
I had plans to meet with Mr. Aoshiro

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.506
and went to the cave bar in Akasaka.

00:03:21.572 --> 00:03:25.610
But then I got a message saying
he couldn't make it.

00:03:25.677 --> 00:03:27.312
Mr. Aoshiro picked the bar?

00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:28.212
Yes.

00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:31.749
That's when a pretty woman approached me.

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:36.187
But I suddenly got sleepy
after drinking with her.

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:40.358
Next thing I know, I'm waking up
in a public men's room in the park.

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:46.998
I had no idea Ms. Komiyama was lying dead
just a few feet away in the women's stall.

00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:48.633
It wasn't me who killed her!

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.534
We know.

00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:52.003
Mr. Watanabe said the same.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.007
We found out a lot of information.

00:03:57.442 --> 00:04:03.014
Just between us, I think we can
clear your name.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.989
Please tell us everything you know.

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:16.527
Okay.

00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:21.265
Hey, isn't that her?

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:23.801
-Madoka!
-Let's go.

00:04:27.438 --> 00:04:28.406
Hello!

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:33.444
I'm sorry for ambushing you.

00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:35.279
What?

00:04:35.847 --> 00:04:37.782
You're Madoka Hashimoto, right?

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.084
Who are you?

00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:44.088
I'm Hinako Shinoda
from the Sengoku Weekly.

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:45.890
And I'm Daisuke Tsubaki.

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.327
What do you want?

00:04:50.228 --> 00:04:52.230
Could we take you home?

00:04:53.264 --> 00:04:55.533
I'm sure Kubozuka told you,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.636
but he's sharing his side of the story
at our office.

00:04:58.703 --> 00:05:01.639
Don't worry, he's in good hands.

00:05:02.607 --> 00:05:03.608
Let's go home.

00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:08.613
I don't want to.

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:16.721
The doll house!

00:05:21.592 --> 00:05:24.128
I liked doll houses too.

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:30.968
The little bear was waiting for you.

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.104
You went to my house?

00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:34.639
I met your mom.

00:05:35.373 --> 00:05:37.809
She's really worried about you,
so please go home.

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:39.010
Don't lie.

00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:41.479
Your mom mentioned your modeling.

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:45.883
I talked to her.

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:50.054
What's this?

00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:52.457
TO MADOKA HASHIMOTO

00:05:57.962 --> 00:05:59.564
Did something happen?

00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:04.302
Maybe it was my fault.

00:06:05.803 --> 00:06:09.407
Madoka dreams of being a model.

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:14.479
When she said she was attending
a seminar for aspiring models,

00:06:15.513 --> 00:06:17.448
I was absolutely against it.

00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:22.086
I told her not to attend
such a shady seminar.

00:06:23.221 --> 00:06:24.055
Then

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:30.194
she accused me of being prejudiced,
and got in a huge fight.

00:06:32.563 --> 00:06:33.998
I should've

00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:37.168
been more open

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.404
and listened to what she had to say.

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:46.110
Your mom regretted her actions.

00:06:47.278 --> 00:06:48.779
So let's go home.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.887
A little after the first incident,

00:06:56.387 --> 00:06:59.223
Mr. Aoshiro asked me for romantic advice.

00:07:02.793 --> 00:07:05.997
There's this girl I can't get rid of.

00:07:06.564 --> 00:07:07.965
That's tough.

00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:10.701
She asks for money every time
we go on a date.

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:12.770
Can't you just break up?

00:07:15.506 --> 00:07:17.241
It's not that easy.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.480
Could you go get dinner with her
next time I'm abroad?

00:07:23.447 --> 00:07:24.782
I'll pay for it.

00:07:25.616 --> 00:07:26.450
Here.

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.086
What?

00:07:32.123 --> 00:07:34.225
I'll come up with an excuse.

00:07:34.892 --> 00:07:35.726
Okay?

00:07:36.494 --> 00:07:37.361
Thanks, man.

00:07:39.463 --> 00:07:42.199
I couldn't say no after taking the money.

00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:47.305
I later met up with her, Ms. Kizaki,
and went back home with her.

00:07:49.574 --> 00:07:51.776
I didn't plan to go,

00:07:51.842 --> 00:07:56.514
but some weird guy with sunglasses
hassled us while we were drinking.

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:57.748
-Huh?
-What?

00:07:57.815 --> 00:07:59.250
He spilled alcohol on me.

00:07:59.317 --> 00:08:03.154
Then Ms. Kizaki offered
to wash them at her place.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.056
That's why you went to her place.

00:08:05.122 --> 00:08:06.857
I thought about saying no,

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:08.993
but I suddenly got sleepy

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.962
and ended up going to her place.

00:08:12.363 --> 00:08:14.332
When I woke up, I was in bed,

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:17.401
and Ms. Kizaki was lying dead next to me.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.905
The second incident…

00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:23.341
YUKO KIZAKI

00:08:23.908 --> 00:08:25.977
I had no idea what was going on.

00:08:26.043 --> 00:08:28.512
I called Mr. Aoshiro right away
'cause I panicked.

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:30.815
I swear I didn't do anything!

00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:34.885
I know that,
but it doesn't look good for you.

00:08:34.952 --> 00:08:36.887
You have a prior offense, right?

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:41.092
So even if you're innocent,
maybe you're better off running away?

00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:42.159
For real?

00:08:44.996 --> 00:08:49.100
I'd been living in fear every day
after that.

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:52.603
After a while Mr. Aoshiro called me,
asking me to hand a letter

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.407
to a woman in Shizuoka
named Makiko Tanioka.

00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:00.011
A few days after delivering it,
not suspecting anything,

00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:02.413
the third death occurred.

00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:08.786
When I read in news that the footprints
at the scene matched the second case,

00:09:09.353 --> 00:09:10.821
I got a bad feeling.

00:09:10.888 --> 00:09:13.324
WANTED
KOTA KUBOZUKA (27)

00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:16.260
Next thing I knew,
I was a wanted fugitive.

00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:21.632
Madoka was with me at the time,
and she encouraged me.

00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:22.700
What's wrong?

00:09:23.234 --> 00:09:25.703
I swear I didn't--

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.771
Don't worry.

00:09:27.538 --> 00:09:29.874
I know it looks bad now,

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.343
but you'll be cleared.

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:36.080
I mean, you need to clear your name
if it wasn't you!

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.389
I knew I shouldn't have depended on her,

00:09:45.456 --> 00:09:47.091
but I got her involved in this.

00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:54.632
I'd like to apologize to Madoka's family.

00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:59.570
When Madoka called her mother once,

00:09:59.637 --> 00:10:03.808
she told her she was with me
and not to tell the police.

00:10:04.675 --> 00:10:06.911
I feel terrible for worrying her.

00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:18.355
Madoka.

00:10:37.074 --> 00:10:37.942
I'm sorry.

00:10:39.977 --> 00:10:41.712
I was wrong.

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:49.420
Me, too.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.457
I'm sorry.

00:10:57.962 --> 00:10:59.096
Welcome home.

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:13.677
Thank you for sharing your side.

00:11:15.546 --> 00:11:18.215
What do you want to do now?

00:11:21.652 --> 00:11:23.053
I'll stop running,

00:11:24.188 --> 00:11:27.191
and try to prove my innocence.

00:11:29.927 --> 00:11:30.761
In that case,

00:11:36.734 --> 00:11:40.671
you have the Sengoku Weekly's
full support.

00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:46.677
Thank you.

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:54.418
You're okay being photographed then?

00:11:55.386 --> 00:11:56.587
Of course.

00:11:56.654 --> 00:11:57.555
Please.

00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:00.591
Could you look my way?

00:12:00.658 --> 00:12:01.492
Okay.

00:12:09.099 --> 00:12:11.502
I'm so glad how that worked out.

00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:12.403
Yes.

00:12:23.314 --> 00:12:25.816
-I'll wait for you in the car.
-Thanks.

00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:29.887
Hello?

00:12:29.954 --> 00:12:31.822
Hinako, is now a good time?

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:33.490
Sure. What's up?

00:12:34.258 --> 00:12:37.494
How about next Sunday
for my visit to Tokyo?

00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:40.698
Sure, I'll take some time off.

00:12:41.498 --> 00:12:43.067
Okay, great.

00:12:46.036 --> 00:12:47.137
Hey, Mom.

00:12:47.204 --> 00:12:48.138
What, dear?

00:12:50.674 --> 00:12:54.845
I’ve decided to keep working
as a tabloid reporter.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.681
I see.

00:12:58.916 --> 00:13:01.986
If that's what you decided,
you have my support.

00:13:03.087 --> 00:13:04.488
Just watch your health.

00:13:05.122 --> 00:13:08.726
Also, don't do anything
that will make people dislike you.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.529
That might be hard to do,

00:13:13.797 --> 00:13:16.600
but I promise not to lie to myself.

00:13:17.368 --> 00:13:18.435
So don't worry.

00:13:19.503 --> 00:13:20.504
Okay.

00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:21.906
What are you doing now?

00:13:21.972 --> 00:13:26.610
I just finished delivering a missing girl
back to her mother.

00:13:28.512 --> 00:13:30.581
You can't surprise me anymore.

00:13:31.148 --> 00:13:33.918
Not after the stakeouts
and undercover work.

00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:37.755
But let me just say one thing.

00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:39.156
What?

00:13:40.891 --> 00:13:44.261
Does the Sengoku Weekly not have
a Columbo?

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:46.096
Here we go again.

00:13:46.163 --> 00:13:48.232
If you keep doing that kind of work,

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:51.969
you're gonna end up in a gun fight
or having to defuse a bomb.

00:13:53.237 --> 00:13:55.306
If that happens,

00:13:55.372 --> 00:13:57.975
I'll go in and help you resign.

00:13:58.042 --> 00:13:59.143
Got it?

00:14:00.844 --> 00:14:02.146
Starting that night,

00:14:02.947 --> 00:14:04.848
work really ramped up.

00:14:04.915 --> 00:14:06.083
Sorry about this, Yamabuki.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.986
The more information we have, the better.

00:14:10.688 --> 00:14:12.556
How's the article coming, Murai?

00:14:12.623 --> 00:14:14.358
-We got the food.
-Thanks!

00:14:14.425 --> 00:14:15.426
Keep it up, everyone.

00:14:16.393 --> 00:14:18.128
Which picture do we go with?

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.132
I'd like this first picture somewhere.

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:24.101
Doesn't this one look better?

00:14:24.168 --> 00:14:29.139
Yes, but this is the moment right after
he prepares himself for what's to come.

00:14:30.674 --> 00:14:31.508
I see.

00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:35.879
Okay! We'll put the headline
over this picture.

00:14:36.413 --> 00:14:38.449
What's the headline? Let's see…

00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:40.484
How about this?

00:14:41.585 --> 00:14:46.357
"Framed Fugitive: Firsthand Account
of the Nightmarish Truth."

00:14:47.758 --> 00:14:50.561
Mr. Murai, that's perfect. We'll use that.

00:14:50.627 --> 00:14:51.829
Copy that.

00:14:53.197 --> 00:14:54.565
Let's eat, everyone.

00:14:54.631 --> 00:14:57.601
Okay, we'll eat and give it one more push.

00:14:57.668 --> 00:15:01.138
And so, the latest issue hit the stands.

00:15:01.205 --> 00:15:02.039
SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:15:05.075 --> 00:15:08.112
FRAMED FUGITIVE: FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT
OF THE NIGHTMARISH TRUTH

00:15:17.688 --> 00:15:18.522
Hello.

00:15:19.223 --> 00:15:20.991
-Good morning.
-Man.

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:23.227
What a reaction.

00:15:23.293 --> 00:15:25.329
The phones won't stop ringing.

00:15:25.396 --> 00:15:26.897
It's making the rounds online.

00:15:26.964 --> 00:15:28.332
Okay, great!

00:15:28.966 --> 00:15:32.036
Stay vigilant. Let's get to work
on the follow-up.

00:15:32.102 --> 00:15:33.037
Yes, sir.

00:15:34.805 --> 00:15:36.707
Mr. Kitahama, breaking news!

00:15:43.514 --> 00:15:48.685
That day, Seiya Aoshiro and
Atsuhiro Imamura were arrested.

00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:54.825
You met both of them in person,
didn't you?

00:15:55.692 --> 00:15:58.362
I'm glad nothing happened to you!

00:15:58.429 --> 00:16:00.464
Both arrested for murder.

00:16:01.398 --> 00:16:03.233
I'm so curious about what happened!

00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:07.438
We'll be covering the motives
in our next issue.

00:16:07.504 --> 00:16:08.505
That's amazing.

00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:10.007
I have to know.

00:16:10.574 --> 00:16:11.408
Tell me!

00:16:12.476 --> 00:16:15.212
Well, basically what happened is,

00:16:15.846 --> 00:16:18.782
Aoshiro and Imamura
both had people to kill.

00:16:18.849 --> 00:16:22.586
But they knew they'd be the first ones
to be suspected.

00:16:23.187 --> 00:16:26.690
So they made a deal to kill
each other's targets and secure alibis.

00:16:26.757 --> 00:16:29.593
In other words, a murder swap!

00:16:30.194 --> 00:16:34.264
Yes, the serial mysterious deaths case
all began

00:16:37.334 --> 00:16:43.107
when Aoshiro's relationship broke down
with the second victim, Yuko Kizaki.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:48.879
Aoshiro expanded his business after
receiving funds from the rich Ms. Kizaki.

00:16:49.546 --> 00:16:52.082
They were also in a sexual relationship.

00:16:52.783 --> 00:16:56.086
To Aoshiro, Ms. Kizaki was just
a convenient means.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.157
He ended things when he no longer
needed funding,

00:17:00.224 --> 00:17:02.793
but she couldn't accept it.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:08.432
She became a nuisance when
she started pressuring him for marriage.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:14.638
Around that time, he met Imamura
at an industry party.

00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:19.543
Imamura's aunt, Ms. Komiyama,
stopped giving him work,

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.712
and his company was in danger.

00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:24.715
He resented her for it.

00:17:25.415 --> 00:17:27.451
Learning of this,

00:17:27.518 --> 00:17:30.254
Aoshiro proposed a murder swap

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.022
and Imamura agreed.

00:17:32.623 --> 00:17:34.091
That was the first murder.

00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.328
Next, Aoshiro went overseas
to create an alibi,

00:17:38.395 --> 00:17:41.465
and Imamura went to kill Ms. Kizaki.

00:17:41.532 --> 00:17:43.834
That was the second murder.

00:17:44.401 --> 00:17:47.304
The third victim, Makiko Tanioka,

00:17:47.371 --> 00:17:52.442
knew Imamura and Ms. Komiyama and
found Ms. Komiyama's death suspicious.

00:17:52.509 --> 00:17:57.981
That's when she happened to take
a picture of Imamura and Aoshiro meeting.

00:17:58.048 --> 00:18:00.083
She used that to blackmail Aoshiro.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.921
Then, Aoshiro instructed Imamura
to kill Ms. Tanioka

00:18:03.987 --> 00:18:05.889
and make it look like an accident.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.325
That was the third murder.

00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:12.563
Those are the bullet points
for the serial mysterious deaths story.

00:18:16.934 --> 00:18:18.135
Ms. Shinoda.

00:18:18.835 --> 00:18:20.237
You really worked hard!

00:18:20.304 --> 00:18:21.371
Good job!

00:18:21.438 --> 00:18:23.340
No need to applaud me for it!

00:18:23.407 --> 00:18:24.508
It's not a big deal.

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:26.476
I'm still a rookie.

00:18:26.543 --> 00:18:27.811
A baby reporter.

00:18:28.812 --> 00:18:30.447
Maybe not even a baby.

00:18:30.514 --> 00:18:32.316
That'd make you an egg!

00:18:33.317 --> 00:18:35.953
I'm trying to incubate something too.

00:18:36.587 --> 00:18:37.688
So actually,

00:18:38.188 --> 00:18:40.591
I'm being transferred this spring.

00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:44.828
To the editorial department
of a sports magazine.

00:18:44.895 --> 00:18:46.230
-What?
-For real?

00:18:46.296 --> 00:18:48.932
I'm so worried!

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:50.734
My heart's about to burst.

00:18:51.335 --> 00:18:52.903
Help me!

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.607
-What do I do?
-Asuka, don't worry!

00:18:56.673 --> 00:18:57.741
You poor thing!

00:19:05.515 --> 00:19:08.218
People are still buying
the Sengoku Weekly.

00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:11.021
SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:19:17.794 --> 00:19:21.865
Are my eyes still clear?

00:19:26.837 --> 00:19:29.072
This is Shinoda from the Sengoku Weekly.

00:19:30.574 --> 00:19:31.908
Thank you!

00:19:31.975 --> 00:19:33.477
I'll head right over!

00:19:33.543 --> 00:19:35.112
Got it. Goodbye.

00:19:38.682 --> 00:19:39.516
Okay!

00:19:51.028 --> 00:19:52.462
THE END

00:19:52.529 --> 00:19:53.930
