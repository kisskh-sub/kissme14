I...

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.940
Fine, forget the overtime pay.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.520
Can you just help me beat Level 5?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.520
I'm totally stuck.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.240
Okay.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.680
You're not gonna do it now?

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.220
Don't let the simple controls fool you.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.680
It's actually way harder

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.240
than the last game.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.260
It's a real brain burner.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.400
Come on, just do it.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.440
I really can't get past it.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.980
Wow, you're amazing.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:44.700
Nie Xiguang,

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.900
have you noticed that you...

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.360
What?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.040
You're almost ready to be discharged.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.260
Mom,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.280
I'm coming home tonight.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.880
And I'm really craving
some pork rib soup.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.760
Can't you go one day
without putting in an order

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.120
before you even step through the door?

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.260
Anyway, what's the occasion?

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.680
I got hurt.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.600
What?

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.780
What happened? Is it serious?

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.520
It's fine, don't worry.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.200
I'm much better.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.880
I just

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.400
missed a step downstairs

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.760
and ended up twisting my ankle.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.820
You're

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.760
a grown-up now.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:29.840
Can't you be more careful

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.060
when you're taking the stairs?

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.120
Do you need the driver

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.380
to go to Suzhou and pick you up?

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.360
No need.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.160
I'll just take the train

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.180
and then grab a cab home.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.900
Gotta go.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.700
Alright.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.220
See you soon.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.320
I once treated a patient

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.120
who fell off the top of a truck.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.980
He landed right on a rock.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.280
Skull fracture.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.460
Intracranial hematoma.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.480
Ruptured spleen.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.540
He spent a month

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.160
in the ICU

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.060
before he was out of the woods.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.600
He fell from a height

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.080
even lower than where you were.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.580
Wait,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.240
why the sudden

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.800
horror story?

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.460
Stop giving the people

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.480
who care about you a reason to worry.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.300
I get it.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.800
I promise it won't happen again.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.260
Um...

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.840
Thanks for everything.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.420
And tell Ms. Chen, thanks
for the delicious food.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.880
She mentioned

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.100
that she really liked

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.440
the gift you got her.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.760
I had Yin Jie

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.800
pick it up for me.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:39.880
I'm glad she likes it.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.100
Nie Xiguang,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.800
you really struggle

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.500
with finding the key issue.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.020
What's

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.520
the key...?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.860
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.800
Mr. Lin,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.180
can you help me

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.160
get rid of these?

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.460
My mom can't see any of this.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.820
Where did this rain come from?

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.760
Aren't we going the wrong way?

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:17.920
It's coming down.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.440
I'm taking you straight back to Wuxi.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.600
I can just go to the station

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.660
and catch a train myself.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.780
Where do you live?

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.620
Put the address in the GPS.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.220
Your phone's locked.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:40.740
Hang on.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.520
There.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.880
You wear glasses for driving?

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.620
Ever since the accident,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.060
my eyesight was also damaged.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.860
The rain makes it worse.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.760
So, that crash

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.800
must have been pretty bad.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:37.820
Mm.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.160
You know,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.280
you're actually pretty incredible.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.220
How so?

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.040
Since you joined us,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.180
morale at the office
has been through the roof.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.740
It seems like

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.440
you're just a natural
at everything you do.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.260
What's so funny?

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.360
I just got a compliment

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.180
from my future boss.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.880
Am I not allowed to be happy about it?

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.940
I am not your future boss.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.100
You never know.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.300
Thanks.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.240
I'm heading back, then.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.240
Thanks again.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.440
Drive safe

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.420
on your way back.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.180
[Shuangyuan Photovoltaic]

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.780
Xiguang,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.620
welcome back.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.940
Sorry about that.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.580
I hate that you guys
had to pick up my slack.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.320
Don't worry about it.
It's not like you had a choice.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.580
You're finally here, Xiguang.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.940
You've filled right back out.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.040
You must've gained at least 2.5 kg.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.340
Your face looks so much firmer.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.060
You're just being jealous.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.280
Who wouldn't be?

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.780
While you were out there living it up,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.040
my workload

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.720
literally doubled.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.400
See?

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.280
Now you know

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.580
just how important I am.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.560
I promise

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.840
I'll never forget my key again.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.160
Seriously, Yin Jie

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.200
is never going to live down

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.400
that "lost key" story.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.280
Don't even start, Mr. Wang.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.920
Last week, when I was
dropping off documents

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.840
for Mr. Wu in Finance,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.720
he looked me dead in the eye

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.840
before I left and said, totally serious,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.160
"Don't forget your key next time."

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.200
Just kill me.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.060
You have no right to complain.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.380
Nie really paid the price

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:50.960
for your mess-up.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.080
Not really.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.620
Nie,

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.140
you're all better now, right?

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:54.920
Yeah.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.140
Actually, the whole department

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.380
wanted to drop by and see you,

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.540
but Mr. Lin said

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.800
you needed peace and quiet,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.260
and a big crowd would be too much,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.340
so we all stayed away.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.260
Hope you don't mind.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.660
Not at all.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.040
Alright, morning meeting

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.720
in ten minutes.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.040
Mr. Lin will be there.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:08.980
- Okay.
- Got it.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:13.900
Morning, everyone.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.900
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Lin.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.540
First of all,

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.060
let's welcome our colleague, Nie,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.080
back to the team after her recovery.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.080
Health comes first.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:31.960
Nie,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.420
you've got to be more careful next time.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.360
Roger that.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.320
I'm back and better than ever.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.620
Don't hold back, bosses.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.760
I'm ready for whatever you need.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.160
I'll take you up on that.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.160
The main focus

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:42.960
for Administration this week

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.180
is the quarterly review,

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.540
the annual summary,

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.560
and coming up

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.760
with a plan for the year-end party.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.680
Lastly,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.260
there's one more important thing.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.360
I've been hearing some talk lately

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.520
that our department has bad "Feng Shui."

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.540
Feng Shui?

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.780
Who's talking such nonsense?

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.520
How come I haven't heard anything?

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.820
Who's spreading these rumors?

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.200
Even reached Mr. Lin's ears.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.220
I'll check it out.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.740
But seriously, what era is this?

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.460
People actually still believe in
that superstition?

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.020
Exactly.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.660
But since I got hurt last month,

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.840
and then this month,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.540
another colleague

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.140
Well, even though the AD/CVD policies

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.700
hit the PV industry harder than ever,

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.720
renewables is still a solid sector.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.360
There are definitely good plays
to be made.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.600
I'm sure

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.080
Risk Management

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:32.740
has provided

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.660
a very thorough background,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.680
but since this involves
cross-border guarantees,

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.180
I'd still suggest we be extra careful

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.900
with the due diligence.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:40.840
Okay,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.000
I'll keep that in mind.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.220
You can head back to work now.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.360
The boss asked Risk Management

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.540
to conduct a second round

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.740
of overseas due diligence and an audit

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.420
on that Rimang Energy project.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.180
I heard.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:54.940
I mean, that guy

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.700
was in the boss's office

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.480
for quite a while this afternoon.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:57.960
Honestly, I'm speechless.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.520
Rimang Energy is listed
on the US stock market,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.880
and with Devon's counter-guarantee,

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.700
its financial security

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.860
is beyond question.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.140
A re-audit

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:06.980
just means

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.020
pushing back the acquisition timeline.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.420
With a target this good,

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.140
other investment firms

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.080
could snatch it from under us

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.860
at any second.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.140
His whole routine

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.660
is just pure paranoia

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.380
and making trouble out of nothing.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.000
Forget it.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.100
You can't be too cautious.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:18.860
True.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.720
But I really can't stand people

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.940
who won't say things to your face,

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:22.860
then sneak off to the boss

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.700
behind your back.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.600
Maybe you're reading too much into it?

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.980
You didn't actually hear anything.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:27.660
Besides, Zhuang

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.580
doesn't seem like that kind of person.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.640
Why?

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.140
What, based on his looks?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.000
Min,

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.060
don't judge a book by its cover.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:34.680
Well,

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.200
he is incredibly handsome.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.070
[Huaya Bank]

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.360
Hello?

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.200
Xiang Qun.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:18.500
Really?

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.600
A wedding on the 2nd?

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.820
Congratulations, man.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.100
You haven't forgotten
what you promised me

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:24.820
back in the dorms, have you?

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.260
You're not going
to be "too busy" for me, are you?

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.460
Of course not.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.740
I'll definitely be there.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.020
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:31:59.080 --> 00:31:59.960
Keep at it

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.900
and win Siliang over as soon as you can.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.860
That would be amazing.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.780
We're all old friends here.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.220
Am I not trying hard enough?

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.200
Maybe I'm just not her type.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.220
Enough about me.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.220
I hope you and Zhang Zhen
get married soon.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.580
Yeah,

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.280
I will marry Zhen.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.200
Marry her!

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.160
Zhuang Xu,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.960
you have to be my best man.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.200
I knew you were biased

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.040
toward Zhuang Xu.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.060
You have to pick the eye candy
for the best man.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.280
Sure.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.620
I'll probably be the last one
to get married anyway.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:32.880
I can be the best man

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.440
for all of you.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.460
No way.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.800
You're such a catch.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.520
You could get married
in a heartbeat if you wanted to.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.320
Exactly.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:48.760
But what do I have

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.560
to offer her right now?

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.840
If I'd known "making peace" with him

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.040
meant working overtime every single day,

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.500
I might have just stayed "enemies."

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:48.720
Mr. Lin,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.000
aren't you leaving yet?

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.400
Well, I'm heading out then.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:53.760
Wait.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.220
Mr. Lin,

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.020
I have a question.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:09.840
Go ahead.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.920
Why do you always make me stay late?

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.840
There are so many others you could ask.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.040
Nie Xiguang,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.940
your family

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:25.639
owns 49%

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.960
of this company.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.900
Nearly half the profits

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.040
go straight into your pockets.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.179
So?

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.100
So, making other people work late

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:34.960
makes me feel guilty,

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.460
like I'm exploiting

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.179
the working class.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.139
But I don't feel bad

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.679
about making you stay, not one bit.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:43.920
And one more thing,

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.179
Nie Xiguang,

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.639
when we're off the clock,

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:49.580
can you stop calling me Mr. Lin?

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.620
Why?

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:54.400
It makes me

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.120
feel like

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:56.980
I'm still working for you...

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.520
Lin Yusen.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:17.960
Bye.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.340
Nie Xiguang.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.460
Come back.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.720
What is it?

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.020
Did you

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.180
put that A Fu figurine

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.100
on my desk

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.020
this morning?

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.360
Yeah.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.560
Someone told me
I should "find the key issue."

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.900
While I was waiting at the station

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.000
on my way back to Suzhou,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.780
the idea just hit me.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.260
So I picked this up
right then and there.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.580
Fifteen yuan. Don't mention it.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.300
By the way,

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.540
that's actually meant for your car,

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.880
not to be left sitting on your desk.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.580
Wishing it keeps you safe on the road.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.440
You bought it back then?

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.040
Why give it to me just now?

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.080
Well, I've been busy

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.900
nursing the wounds

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.480
that fancy dinner left on my wallet.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.180
Was the trauma that deep?

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.320
If you'd given it to me sooner,

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.600
maybe

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.980
I wouldn't have "forgotten" my wallet.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.080
It's a private formula.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:24.980
Care to try it?

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.540
What is it?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.040
Herbal ointment for scars.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.560
Got it from a friend.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.260
It's

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.060
for fading those marks

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.120
from your accident.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.440
It really works.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.320
Thanks.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.180
But it's really no big deal.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.820
The marks will fade.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.220
Maybe so.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.300
But I'm worried

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.940
you'll use that as an excuse
to reject me.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.640
Reject you for what?

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.770
[Wedding Invitation]

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.760
This is an invitation

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.840
to Mr. Lin's friend's wedding.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.680
Wait, isn't this from the girl

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.220
whose screaming
made you fall off the balcony?

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.220
Yep.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.180
He said

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.940
his friend

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.740
was just passing through Suzhou

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.680
to drop off the invite.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.460
She saw me climbing the balcony

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.300
and it scared the life out of her.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.020
Apparently, she has
a major fear of heights.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.100
Mr. Lin said

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.020
she's been feeling guilty about it,

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.140
so she invited me

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.220
to her wedding.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.380
It's in Shanghai on New Year's Day.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.080
Should I go?

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.520
Of course you should.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.440
Why pass up a free meal?

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.880
Wait, you don't have to
give a cash gift, do you?

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.340
Probably not.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.180
But that's not the point.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.320
How is that not the point?

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.740
Check out the names on the invite.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.580
Your name is written

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.760
right next to Mr. Lin's.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.080
That means you're off the hook.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.080
You count as a "plus one."

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:03.900
But,

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.180
your name looks like

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.240
it was added later.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.040
Well, obviously.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.340
She didn't even know me before.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.760
The handwriting is a bit awkward.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:16.880
Maybe the invites

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.800
were all written by someone
with nice handwriting,

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.460
and the bride added

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.960
your name herself, I guess.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:24.980
Perhaps.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:26.620
It's not like

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.780
Mr. Lin added it himself.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:28.440
His handwriting

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.420
is way better than this.

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.300
What are you even thinking?

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.380
Why would he trick me
into going to a wedding?

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.240
True.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.960
Anyway, it's a free ride,

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.700
so you're definitely going.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.620
Dress to impress.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:40.540
The mission is simple:

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:41.800
Eat, drink, and be merry, all for free.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.100
Calm down.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.920
Seriously, Yin Jie,

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.800
why are you more excited than Xiguang?

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.400
I've been watching their story unfold

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.420
from day one.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:52.880
Don't you get it?

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.060
Now Xiguang and Mr. Lin

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.480
are going to a wedding together.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:58.720
You know what they call that?

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.160
"Affection blooming
in the face of adversity."

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:02.540
Xiguang,

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.020
if we'd known

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.480
that "jumping off" a balcony
is what it takes

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.180
to change his mind about you,

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.060
you should've jumped ages ago.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:11.680
I...

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.920
If I told you that jumping
from the second floor

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.160
would get you a promotion,

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.020
would you do it?

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.400
How big of a promotion?

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.120
I'll have to give that some thought.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.350
[Shuangyuan Photovoltaic]

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:47.660
Boss?

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:48.980
Why

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.780
the sudden call?

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.600
Listen to you.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.000
Can't I just call you

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.860
out of the blue

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.700
to catch up and bond a little?

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.340
Well,

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.900
it's been almost two months

00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.980
since we last talked.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.400
Fair enough.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.340
So, what kind of "bonding"
are we talking about?

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.880
What else could it be?

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.560
The reason I've been MIA lately

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.440
is that I've been swamped
with wedding planning.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.680
Wait, what? You're getting married too?

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.540
"Too"?

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:20.820
Who else?

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:22.580
Oh, no one.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.040
Just a colleague.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.020
So

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.580
you're calling

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:30.840
to invite me

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.740
to your wedding?

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.160
You got it.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.080
What's the deal?

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.220
Isn't this a bit fast?

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.480
We just graduated, didn't we?

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.980
Our parents were breathing down
our necks to get hitched.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.780
But honestly, we want to pool our money

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.680
and buy a place.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.100
Pool money for a house? You win.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.920
Well, congratulations.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.860
What's the date? I'll be there.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.100
January 2nd.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.520
And just showing up isn't enough.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.980
I need everyone

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.460
to come a day earlier to help me out.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.100
Our budget is tight,

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.040
so we're doing
all the decorations ourselves.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.360
"Everyone"?

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.720
Yeah, both our dorms.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.560
I don't think I can make it on the 1st.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.980
You know how it is in Finance,

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.940
we always have to work overtime
at the start of every month.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.260
Even on New Year's Day?

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.400
Uh-huh. Pure cruelty, isn't it?
