00:25.692 --> 00:30.196
Woo Han Construction's Bluevista
offers generous spacing between buildings…

00:30.280 --> 00:34.242
This is me from a happier time,
before I had anything like a superpower.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.703
-The subway is within five minutes…
-Eighteenth floor…

00:36.786 --> 00:39.497
Just like other ordinary young men,

00:39.581 --> 00:43.960
I'd get off work, drink beer,
and play games on my phone to chill out.

00:44.878 --> 00:50.300
And on weekends, I'd browse houses
we could never afford in this lifetime.

00:54.596 --> 00:58.016
This person, fascinated by the sleek
four-bay, 59 square-meter space,

00:58.099 --> 00:59.934
is my girlfriend, Min-suk.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.813
Having been together for nine years,
she's like family now.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.858
The layout is really well-designed.
Don't you think?

01:06.941 --> 01:09.027
How is it possible
that all the rooms face south?

01:09.527 --> 01:10.779
It's a four-bay layout.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.072
What do you think?

01:13.448 --> 01:15.366
It's great.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.078
I agree. I love it.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.664
Must be the walk-in closet.

01:32.425 --> 01:35.095
BEYOND THEIR WORLD, YOURS BEGINS

01:38.515 --> 01:39.349
That's right.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.644
No reason I can't get a place like this
in the metro area.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.855
If I scrape together everything I have…

01:45.939 --> 01:46.898
700 million won?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.402
I can't afford it.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.071
Not in this lifetime.

01:53.154 --> 01:56.366
The deposit is 20%,
which comes out to 140 million won.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.451
The deposit cannot be paid for
with a loan.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.621
What's the cutoff for the housing lottery?

02:01.704 --> 02:03.331
When did you last own a home?

02:03.414 --> 02:04.874
I'm confident about this.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.128
Never. Not since birth.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.966
It's counted from age 30.

02:14.092 --> 02:14.926
I see.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.596
Then it's been five years for me.

02:18.680 --> 02:23.017
Well, the complex right next to this one
opened for presale last month.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.227
And the cutoff was…

02:24.310 --> 02:25.353
Let's see.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.148
The 59-square-meter layout
required 61 points.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.441
What about our points?

02:30.525 --> 02:34.070
Neither of us has 30 points. Let's go.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.532
-All right. Thank you.
-You should take this.

02:37.615 --> 02:40.493
Scratch and get a free gift.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.203
Okay, thank you.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.127
To celebrate the opening
of our model home,

02:49.210 --> 02:51.838
Bluevista is offering
generous gifts to visitors

02:51.921 --> 02:54.007
who schedule a sales consultation.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.260
Be sure to schedule a consultation
and seize this lucky chance.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.053
You can all be the lucky winners.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.014
BLUEVISTA GRAND OPENING EVENT
WITH BIG PRIZES

03:01.097 --> 03:02.348
Air purifiers and steam closets…

03:02.432 --> 03:04.225
I have no luck with winning prizes.

03:04.309 --> 03:08.980
I've never even won a roll of toilet paper
at a local supermarket giveaway.

03:09.898 --> 03:10.815
Housing lottery? As if.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.358
SCRATCH-OFF LOTTERY EVENT
NO WIN!

03:16.487 --> 03:17.864
As for the contract deposit,

03:19.115 --> 03:21.242
we can pull together
the deposit from here,

03:21.326 --> 03:23.870
the 20 million won you've saved,

03:23.953 --> 03:25.288
and my 40 million won…

03:26.664 --> 03:29.042
But we're still short 30 million won.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.877
What about my deposit?

03:30.960 --> 03:33.421
I saw your account is 500,000 won short.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.761
Min-suk likes money.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.387
From a young age,

03:41.471 --> 03:44.390
she was sharp enough to keep books
at her dad's chicken joint.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.644
Now, she's the head of accounting
at a small company

03:47.727 --> 03:50.188
and manages my income and expenses
as a hobby.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.733
Sang-ung, why aren't you answering?

03:56.986 --> 03:58.029
YOUR ORDER HAS SHIPPED

03:59.781 --> 04:01.074
That's it. Your phone.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.827
Min-suk is someone
who will take on the tax office.

04:04.911 --> 04:09.332
There is no way someone like me
could fool Min-suk.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.130
Jeez, I bought a bike
to cut commuting costs.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.886
That kind of expense
should be discussed first.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.388
Top it up.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.682
You've changed.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.476
At least one of us needs to grow up.

04:28.559 --> 04:29.978
Think about our retirement.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.897
Anyway, we'll find a way
to get the 30 million.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.649
-The problem is winning.
-That's hot.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.068
Short non-ownership period
and no dependents.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.488
Which brings me to my next point.
Let's get married.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.576
The first-time buyer draw
is random with slim odds.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.620
We should go for the supply for newlyweds.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.247
What's wrong?

04:50.039 --> 04:50.999
Is there a problem?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.836
What a romantic proposal.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.671
Hang on.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.007
Shouldn't I be the one proposing?

05:00.591 --> 05:01.426
Well,

05:02.010 --> 05:03.344
come to think of it,

05:03.428 --> 05:06.514
Min-suk was the one who asked me out too.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.529
I can't do this.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.532
Let's stop here.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.160
What?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.788
I went to the hair salon twice
just this month.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.957
It's expensive
to change clothes every day.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.711
You also spent a lot on me,
treating me to meals and movies.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.922
If this doesn't work out,
we'll both have wasted money.

05:40.423 --> 05:44.385
If we're not going to date officially,
let's stop the unnecessary spending.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.973
She may sound angry, but really,

05:49.640 --> 05:53.061
she's just worried I'm spending too much.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.530
Okay.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.038
Are you an idiot?

06:12.955 --> 06:14.248
I'm saying we should date.

06:25.718 --> 06:26.552
Okay.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.400
That's how we dated for nine years.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.114
So it turns out
that our money wasn't wasted.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.121
I'll buy you a PS5.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.377
If I say yes now, it'll seem like
I'm marrying her because of it.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.339
-Don't you want one?
-Okay.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.135
-Are you serious?
-Of course!

07:08.261 --> 07:09.846
Then we're getting married, right?

07:10.638 --> 07:11.472
Yes.

07:15.393 --> 07:16.936
I already entered your details.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.730
Just stamp it.
Gotta register before the housing lottery.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.984
Gosh, when did you fill all of this out?

07:23.067 --> 07:24.152
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

07:30.908 --> 07:31.742
What is it?

07:31.826 --> 07:33.161
Dad wants me to come over.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.329
-Why?
-No idea. He's got something for me.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.497
What?

07:37.081 --> 07:38.749
-Money?
-No way.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.169
Probably something useless again.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.421
He planted too much cabbage last year

07:43.504 --> 07:45.923
and told us to take a bunch
to avoid burying it again.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.675
Don't get your hopes up.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.595
It's either radish or cabbage.

08:17.413 --> 08:20.249
LEE EUN-HUI

08:26.881 --> 08:27.757
I'm here.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.676
You're here, my son!

08:32.011 --> 08:34.722
My goodness. You've come such a long way.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.057
You must be hungry.

08:36.641 --> 08:37.475
This is my mom.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.728
-Here.
-You didn't have to.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.647
I know you like soy milk.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.065
It was a long trip, right?

08:44.148 --> 08:45.441
Are you here, Sang-ung?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.360
Come in here.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.392
This is my dad.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.064
To be honest,

09:25.773 --> 09:29.026
I find my dad incredibly uncomfortable.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.491
SANG-UNG

09:36.534 --> 09:40.830
My family took a direct hit during
the IMF crisis when I was nine.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.460
JEONGJA LOANS

09:46.544 --> 09:49.422
After losing his job,
my dad never found his footing

09:49.922 --> 09:51.299
and kept drifting around.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.800
LOAN AGREEMENT
BORROWER: KANG DONG-GI

09:52.883 --> 09:54.552
-Refill, please.
-Is the food coming?

09:54.635 --> 09:56.971
-Hurry it up, will you?
-Okay, I'm sorry.

09:57.054 --> 10:00.266
It was obvious the rest of the family
would have a hard time.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.872
They say you understand your parents
as you get older,

10:23.456 --> 10:24.540
but not me.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.879
Now that I'm the age my dad was back then,

10:30.880 --> 10:35.509
I can clearly see
how irresponsible and incompetent he was.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.055
Have you been well?

10:40.056 --> 10:40.973
Well, you know…

10:41.932 --> 10:43.768
Weren't you going to give me something?

10:43.851 --> 10:45.186
Yes, that's right.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.565
I took mandatory retirement yesterday.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.941
Retired?

10:51.025 --> 10:54.320
That is ridiculous.
He can't retire from a job he never had.

10:54.403 --> 10:57.365
I'll be getting my national pension
beginning this month.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.200
I see.

11:01.702 --> 11:02.703
I'm a little busy.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.582
If you have something to say,
please say it now.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.179
Do you have

11:21.347 --> 11:22.306
some money?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.309
Just as I expected.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.729
I'm never lucky enough to win anything.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.149
It's radish or cabbage.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.027
Well, how much?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.487
Not too much.

11:36.570 --> 11:37.530
Just…

11:39.448 --> 11:40.700
10,000 won is enough.

11:47.748 --> 11:48.874
Sang-ung.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.377
Listen carefully.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.464
I'm going to sell something to you.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.091
What is this?

11:57.174 --> 11:59.593
Is it some pyramid scheme or something?

11:59.677 --> 12:01.762
It's been passed down in my family
for generations.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.598
-What?
-I've done enough.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.726
It's time for you to keep it going.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.810
What are you saying?

12:07.893 --> 12:09.103
Let go and talk--

12:10.312 --> 12:11.272
Hey.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.911
What the…

13:50.538 --> 13:51.831
What's going on right now?

13:55.668 --> 13:56.794
Is that a gun?

14:04.343 --> 14:05.261
Get up.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.082
My forehead!

14:38.294 --> 14:39.128
What?

14:51.640 --> 14:53.642
What is this?

14:54.310 --> 14:55.561
It's a superpower.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.815
I also bought this power
from your grandfather at your age.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.650
Against my will, like now.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.235
What?

15:03.319 --> 15:05.779
More money, more power.
Even your wounds heal.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.532
But the thing is…

15:10.618 --> 15:11.827
Open your wallet.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.592
Using more power
makes more money disappear.

15:30.054 --> 15:30.888
What the hell…

15:30.971 --> 15:32.806
Don't tell anyone you have this power.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.559
There are only two rules.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.561
Quietly help those in need.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.357
-And don't touch other people's money.
-Wait a minute.

15:42.816 --> 15:43.817
So you're saying

15:44.777 --> 15:47.738
the more money I spend,
the stronger this superpower gets.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.366
And I have to use it

15:51.325 --> 15:52.534
for other people?

15:53.702 --> 15:55.996
-Yes.
-I'm not some kind of pushover!

15:56.080 --> 15:58.207
-I don't want to!
-Someone has to do it.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.337
In that case,

16:04.505 --> 16:05.339
this power…

16:06.924 --> 16:07.800
Take it back.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.512
Take it.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.473
Once you inherit it,
there's no going back.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.684
I'm retiring now.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.895
I only planned to do it
until the pension came in.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.399
What about selling it to someone else?

16:24.191 --> 16:26.777
You sold it to me too!

16:26.860 --> 16:28.696
Do you think I haven't tried that?

16:29.613 --> 16:32.157
Blood. It has to be in the blood.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.372
If you ever get into trouble,
use this contact.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.207
Only if it's necessary.

16:42.209 --> 16:45.295
He's a father, yet he's handing his son
a third-rate loan shark's business card.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.380
JEONGJA LOANS

16:46.463 --> 16:47.840
CHAIRWOMAN PARK JEONG-JA

16:47.923 --> 16:51.260
My life was screwed
from the moment I was born.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.933
When you use your power,

16:58.017 --> 17:00.019
coins fall out like crumbs.

17:01.061 --> 17:04.273
Back in the day, spending 10,000 won
would get me about 500 won back.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.109
But it's not much these days.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.361
Pick up the ones in front too.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.197
You'll have to start saving every penny

17:12.906 --> 17:14.616
to help others.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.088
Take the six-clove garlic when you leave.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.632
It's spicy and delicious.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.347
Superpower?

17:38.849 --> 17:40.476
It was completely ridiculous,

17:40.976 --> 17:42.186
but it was real.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.746
Dad told me not to tell anyone.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.833
Min-suk and I keep no secrets
from each other.

18:06.668 --> 18:07.669
So you're saying

18:08.712 --> 18:11.799
your father gave you a superpower,
not money?

18:15.302 --> 18:18.263
And if you use it, your money disappears?

18:18.847 --> 18:19.681
Yeah.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.394
The more money I have in my hand,
the stronger I get.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.273
But if I use that power,
the money disappears.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.401
What kind of bullshit is this?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.072
Are you that opposed to marriage?

18:36.073 --> 18:37.324
That's right.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.046
No, that's not it.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.340
I meant the superpower.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.474
Here.

19:03.058 --> 19:03.976
Hang onto this.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.854
Here is 10,000 won.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.900
I've put it in here.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.534
-Watch closely.
-What weird stuff is he up to now?

19:50.272 --> 19:51.106
See?

19:51.940 --> 19:53.108
The money.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.569
The money is gone.

19:56.904 --> 19:57.905
I'm telling you.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.907
The money has disappeared.

20:00.782 --> 20:01.617
Gosh.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.537
Jeez, of all things,
why does the money have to disappear?

20:09.416 --> 20:11.668
Did you watch
another weird magic trick online?

20:12.544 --> 20:15.214
-That's not it at all.
-Then try bending that one too.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.759
Give me 10,000 won.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.231
Look closely.

20:43.951 --> 20:47.704
He wants me to use my money for good deeds
without drawing attention.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.457
What should I do?

20:56.380 --> 20:57.214
Come with me.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.426
Put all of this back to how it was too.

21:01.927 --> 21:02.761
Okay.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.644
Min-suk. I need some money.
Just 10,000 won. Come on, 10,000 won.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.446
First of all,
the situation we're in isn't clear.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.951
Like, can it only be done with cash?
And how much will it cost? Let's find out.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.205
We might find a use for it.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.917
-All right.
-Good.

21:34.793 --> 21:35.836
Here.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.346
-Ready?
-Yeah.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.518
Get yourself ready.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.436
0 WON

21:52.519 --> 21:54.187
10,000 WON

21:54.271 --> 21:55.188
20,000 WON

21:55.272 --> 21:56.732
All right, now jump.

21:58.942 --> 21:59.818
LONG JUMP!

21:59.901 --> 22:00.736
0 WON, 2 METERS

22:00.819 --> 22:01.653
10,000 WON, 4 METERS

22:01.737 --> 22:02.612
20,000 WON, 6 METERS

22:02.696 --> 22:04.031
20,000 WON, 10,000 WON, 0 WON

22:04.114 --> 22:05.240
0 WON

22:05.324 --> 22:07.367
10,000 WON

22:07.451 --> 22:09.328
20,000 WON

22:19.171 --> 22:20.297
You guys are out.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.675
All right, here. Try lifting this.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.010
0 WON

22:25.093 --> 22:27.220
10,000 WON

22:27.304 --> 22:29.890
20,000 WON

22:40.233 --> 22:41.651
-Take a look.
-Okay.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.988
There are too many restrictions.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.532
NO DIFFERENCE

22:48.241 --> 22:49.576
You can only use cash.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.495
You have to keep it on your body.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.791
A two-meter jump costs 10,000 won,
but a ladder truck is cheaper.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.877
You could enter the UFC,
but dropping coins makes that impossible.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.420
350 WON IN CHANGE FALLS OUT

23:01.171 --> 23:03.965
If you run out of money in the middle,
you could actually die.

23:08.804 --> 23:09.971
However you look at it,

23:11.306 --> 23:13.058
it's less efficient than a machine.

23:14.309 --> 23:15.769
We need to get married

23:16.478 --> 23:17.771
and buy a house too.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.606
It's the final metro-area lottery.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.942
If you go around using the power,

23:22.442 --> 23:23.819
we know exactly how it'll end.

23:28.448 --> 23:31.118
Let's not use the superpower.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.079
Yeah.

23:35.747 --> 23:36.998
There's no use for it.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.420
I'm off.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.684
Darn it.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.439
Maybe I was hopeful
because I saw it as an inheritance.

24:13.034 --> 24:14.202
120,000 won.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.505
It was a view I'd never seen before.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.385
Looking down from the sky,
Seoul was beautiful.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.310
What my dad passed on to me
was not a superpower.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.647
It was poverty.

25:30.445 --> 25:35.575
ALARM

25:51.508 --> 25:52.634
Get up!

26:09.192 --> 26:11.820
Min-suk and I have set new rules.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.531
Don't carry cash around anymore!

26:23.999 --> 26:25.083
Don't run either.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.087
Don't use too much force or move too fast.

26:30.338 --> 26:31.673
They'll all become habits.

26:33.133 --> 26:34.217
It's all money.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.353
Shall I help you with…

26:46.438 --> 26:47.397
Oh my, sure.

26:49.899 --> 26:50.900
Gosh.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.028
Don't use force.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.577
Don't spend money.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.329
If you do that, I swear

27:03.204 --> 27:04.164
we're done.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.081
Oh my.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.503
Ma'am, let me carry this for you.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.963
My goodness, thank you.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.423
Freaking bastard.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.133
Wow, this is heavy.

27:21.306 --> 27:25.602
If I had a lot of money,
I would've been such a good person.

27:35.320 --> 27:39.574
It's the only way to get my own home
in this harsh world.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.160
CHANGIL-DONG ADMINISTRATIVE WELFARE CENTER

27:42.243 --> 27:43.536
Good morning.

27:45.747 --> 27:48.083
I was always a bit selfish,

27:49.417 --> 27:53.880
but I'll have to become
an even more selfish bastard.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.344
Are you okay?

28:10.313 --> 28:13.650
Piercing eyes, like she's asking
if helping her would cost me.

28:13.733 --> 28:14.901
I'll help you with that.

28:15.735 --> 28:18.113
Unfortunately, it does.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.531
Why are you doing this alone?

28:20.573 --> 28:22.742
Seriously, he could have helped.

28:25.161 --> 28:27.080
He couldn't even help lift a jug of water?

28:27.580 --> 28:28.498
Seriously.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.252
And he's been slacking off lately.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.761
Mr. Kang Sang-ung?

28:42.429 --> 28:43.430
You got a minute?

28:46.766 --> 28:47.934
What is this?

28:50.228 --> 28:52.105
CIVIL COMPLAINT
UNKINDNESS, DISGRACEFUL CONDUCT

28:52.188 --> 28:55.108
"Despite an elderly woman asking for help,
he refused to carry her bags."

28:55.191 --> 28:57.193
"And he displayed a dismissive attitude."

28:57.277 --> 28:59.779
"The name of that civil servant
was Kang Sang-ung."

29:02.741 --> 29:04.909
-I'm sorry.
-What's with you this morning?

29:05.785 --> 29:06.619
Sorry?

29:07.829 --> 29:08.663
What do you mean?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.582
You've been acting strange all morning.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.460
You're not greeting people,

29:13.543 --> 29:15.044
not holding the door for them.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.757
Did you win the lottery?

29:21.050 --> 29:22.260
Or you got pull now?

29:23.803 --> 29:25.930
Is there something I should know about?

29:26.014 --> 29:28.892
Stop scratching already! I'm talking here.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.312
It's just so itchy.

29:33.396 --> 29:34.230
I'm sorry.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.317
Go.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.736
Go, just go.

29:40.403 --> 29:41.362
Okay, then.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.252
Walk faster.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.630
He thinks he's in A Better Tomorrow
or something.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.010
Holding back my strength all day

30:05.136 --> 30:08.473
takes a lot of strength.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.273
At the age
where people talk about newlywed life,

30:17.357 --> 30:19.108
the chances aren't all that high, but…

30:19.192 --> 30:20.318
Jeez.

30:21.402 --> 30:23.279
Where are we going to get 30 million won?

30:28.117 --> 30:29.536
-Got any source of money?
-No.

30:29.619 --> 30:30.870
Of course, you don't.

30:37.544 --> 30:40.338
Should I try investing in stocks again?

30:41.464 --> 30:44.759
The officer on our admin team
recently invested in stocks.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.678
-They made a huge return on--
-You.

30:47.637 --> 30:48.680
Don't even think about it.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.807
No stocks.

30:51.307 --> 30:54.018
Cryptocurrency is out too. No way.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.398
Everyone says they make a lot.

30:59.607 --> 31:02.777
The ones who lose stay quiet,
and the ones who win make all the noise.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.696
Just go look at the Hangang River.

31:04.779 --> 31:07.365
You see more people than fish
on days when stocks crash.

31:07.448 --> 31:09.784
All staring at their phones
even as they drift away.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.495
Whether it's stocks or crypto,
90% are losing money.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.746
And you? Top 10%?

31:21.671 --> 31:23.006
Not gonna happen.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.177
If she's this harsh,

31:28.261 --> 31:30.388
why does she even want to marry me?

31:32.348 --> 31:33.391
All right.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.268
What now?

31:37.395 --> 31:40.440
First, let's sell
all the stuff we don't need.

31:40.523 --> 31:41.357
What?

31:41.441 --> 31:43.359
What could we possibly not need?

31:43.443 --> 31:44.777
-The air purifier.
-What?

31:44.861 --> 31:46.571
-This sofa.
-What?

31:46.654 --> 31:48.573
-That lamp over there.
-The lamp?

31:48.656 --> 31:51.034
-And that dining table.
-If we sell the dining table…

31:51.534 --> 31:54.370
-Where do we eat?
-We're eating here right now.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.080
You don't need two tablets, right?

31:58.333 --> 31:59.667
Of course I need them.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.378
I can surf the Internet
while watching a movie,

32:02.462 --> 32:04.923
or watch a movie
while surfing the Internet.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.257
You don't need them, right?

32:08.051 --> 32:09.677
Of course I don't need them.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.595
Right?

32:11.888 --> 32:14.641
If we sell them all,
we might get about a million won.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.520
I've already sold everything.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.815
2-SEAT TABLE, A-BRAND 11-INCH TABLET, SOLD

32:22.899 --> 32:24.067
When did you…

32:25.109 --> 32:26.361
But why just my stuff?

32:26.444 --> 32:28.029
Mine has nicer designs.

32:30.698 --> 32:31.908
I can't agree.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.786
Her entire house is Provence-style.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.538
I really hate the Provence style.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.375
Why would furniture have windows?

32:41.542 --> 32:43.252
I just don't get it.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.634
Is that heavy?

32:49.717 --> 32:50.635
No, it's light.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.769
-Bring the PlayStation on your way back.
-Okay.

32:59.852 --> 33:01.187
Be careful when you get cash.

33:01.270 --> 33:03.439
Walk slowly. Don't use your strength.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.317
Okay.

33:08.611 --> 33:09.821
See you later.

33:10.571 --> 33:11.531
I'll be back.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.004
I've sold everything now.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.013
Are you the buyer?

33:35.096 --> 33:36.180
-Buyer?
-Yes.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.390
Yes, that's right.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.766
Thought it was a woman's ID.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.977
It's my girlfriend's ID,
but I'm here instead.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.187
That's how it is.
My wife's the seller, not me.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.564
I see.

33:44.647 --> 33:46.482
-Check the item first.
-Okay, let's sit.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.699
I can see the main console.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.702
-And the controllers.
-Yes.

34:00.663 --> 34:01.873
But these are…

34:01.956 --> 34:03.583
I don't have the console anymore,

34:03.666 --> 34:06.210
so it felt pointless
holding on to the games.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.211
Please take them.

34:08.713 --> 34:09.547
Then how much…

34:09.630 --> 34:10.840
No, just take them.

34:10.923 --> 34:12.467
-I can just take them?
-Yes.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.844
This one is the most fun.

34:14.927 --> 34:15.970
I see.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.514
-Oh my, I'll make sure I try this one.
-Good.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.432
Thank you.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.226
-I should pay you, then.
-Right.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.394
Okay, just a moment.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.354
-It's 450,000 won, right?
-Yes.

34:26.689 --> 34:27.857
Here's your 450,000 won.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.152
-Did you check it?
-Yes, all good.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.570
I'll use it well.

34:33.112 --> 34:33.946
Oh my.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.532
It must be nice.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.577
My wife let me play games
before we got married,

34:39.660 --> 34:41.496
but she changed after we had kids.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.122
-I see.
-Enjoy it while you can.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.916
I will. Thank you.

34:45.666 --> 34:48.586
I'll skip the games this weekend
and take the kids out with this.

34:48.669 --> 34:50.004
-Enjoy somewhere nice.
-Sure.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.631
-Good night.
-Yes, good night.

34:51.714 --> 34:52.715
Thank you.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.136
Come on! Yes!

34:59.347 --> 35:00.389
Hey, mister.

35:00.890 --> 35:01.891
Made good money?

35:02.391 --> 35:03.810
You bastard!

35:04.811 --> 35:05.645
Damn it.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.150
You fucking asshole.

35:16.572 --> 35:17.490
Please help!

35:17.573 --> 35:19.158
Son of a bitch, shut your mouth.

35:19.867 --> 35:20.910
Somebody save me!

35:23.121 --> 35:24.413
It's none of my business.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.541
Please help me.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.547
-Hey, is this it?
-Yes, that's all of it.

35:37.051 --> 35:38.177
Here you go.

35:40.847 --> 35:41.889
That's everything.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.016
-Three against one.
-Please save me.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.101
Even if I win somehow,

35:46.227 --> 35:48.229
this fight won't end
with just a few bills.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.779
That's all I have.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.792
If I had a lot of money,

36:10.376 --> 36:11.961
I would've been a good person.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.006
A damn good person.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.429
You're home.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.308
Did something happen?

36:38.613 --> 36:40.698
Did you offer a discount?
You're short 20,000.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.534
I was desperate for the bathroom,
so I ran.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.245
I told you not to run.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.122
Sorry.

36:55.922 --> 36:56.756
I am…

36:59.217 --> 37:00.176
trash.

37:13.648 --> 37:14.732
This is funny.

37:15.441 --> 37:16.692
Sang-ung, listen to this.

37:17.485 --> 37:21.322
Guess what the stars in the night sky
and apartments in Seoul have in common.

37:22.949 --> 37:23.908
What is it?

37:24.909 --> 37:27.203
There are so many of them,
but you can't get one.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.255
Sang-ung.

37:40.132 --> 37:41.300
Let's live a good life.

37:44.428 --> 37:45.263
Yeah.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.065
I want to live a good life too.

37:57.108 --> 38:00.069
I want to live a good life so badly.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.250
DEFEATED 10 THUGS
ACHIEVED $3,000,000 IN CASH

38:14.333 --> 38:16.669
The heroes in games
receive money for saving others.

38:16.752 --> 38:20.881
They use that money to buy clothes,
medicine, and even houses.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.384
Trust me.

38:23.467 --> 38:26.762
If this person had to help others
with their hard-earned money,

38:27.763 --> 38:29.390
they'd never be able to do it.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.160
Over here.

38:53.164 --> 38:53.998
Oh my.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.334
I ordered an iced Americano for you.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.793
Why would you do that?

38:58.294 --> 39:00.296
Do you want to eat anything sweet?

39:00.379 --> 39:01.255
Don't bother.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.382
You need to save up fast and buy a house.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.300
That's right.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.386
-What's wrong?
-What?

39:08.763 --> 39:10.306
It's just psoriasis.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.933
-Have you seen a doctor?
-Yes.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.810
I just need to put some ointment on it.

39:17.646 --> 39:18.814
Just like your father.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.816
He'd get blisters like this too.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.402
They'd heal for a bit,
then come back again.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.613
Why'd you have to inherit that? Seriously!

39:25.696 --> 39:28.240
Come on. What do you mean "inherit"?

39:28.324 --> 39:29.658
Gosh, seriously.

39:30.743 --> 39:34.914
Dad hid his superpowers
from Mom his whole life.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.666
Well, I didn't know either.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.337
And that's why I can't say anything.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.343
Right. I have something to give you.

39:47.426 --> 39:48.469
What is it this time?

39:49.345 --> 39:51.680
I don't want to inherit anything else.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.934
I preferred it when they just gave me
radishes and cabbages.

39:55.851 --> 39:57.061
Ta-da!

39:59.230 --> 40:00.231
Is it bread?

40:01.065 --> 40:01.899
What is it?

40:09.782 --> 40:10.616
What is this?

40:12.243 --> 40:14.703
-What is this money about?
-It's from my savings pool.

40:15.663 --> 40:18.165
I heard there could be a gift tax
if I wired it,

40:18.249 --> 40:20.209
so I brought it as soon as I got it.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.170
It's 30 million won,
and I added a little more to it.

40:27.466 --> 40:29.677
Things are good
between you and Min-suk, right?

40:31.762 --> 40:34.181
Better get married soon.
You'll need the money.

40:34.265 --> 40:37.977
Go for the lottery,
or settle for an apartment farther out.

40:38.060 --> 40:41.188
Like your dad, you can go on for 20 years
about house prices crashing,

40:41.272 --> 40:42.565
but nothing changes.

40:42.648 --> 40:45.317
Just don't live like your dad, okay?

40:48.612 --> 40:49.655
30 million won.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.867
We've got the entire deposit ready.

40:55.161 --> 40:58.289
Thank you. I really needed this money.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.542
We always need money.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.379
I'm going to Spain tomorrow.

41:06.213 --> 41:07.882
Spain? Tomorrow?

41:08.757 --> 41:10.968
You know, I've never been overseas
in my life.

41:11.051 --> 41:13.262
I don't know what got into your dad,

41:13.345 --> 41:15.890
but he said we should travel and stuff
from now on.

41:17.057 --> 41:18.225
Unbelievable.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.937
-Be careful when you're taking that home.
-Okay.

41:23.814 --> 41:26.025
-Finish the rest before you go.
-Leaving so soon?

41:26.108 --> 41:28.777
-Yes, I have plans. I'm off.
-Wait, Mom…

41:30.738 --> 41:31.572
Thank you.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.032
-Sure.
-Bye, then.

41:46.879 --> 41:48.672
I decided to think positively.

41:49.256 --> 41:52.218
No, there's nothing to think about.
Of course it's a good thing.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.305
The newlywed housing lottery
isn't that competitive,

41:56.388 --> 41:58.307
and we've got the deposit ready.

42:00.100 --> 42:02.228
Only good things left now.

42:16.492 --> 42:17.576
Hey, Min-suk.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.328
I have some good news.

42:19.411 --> 42:20.663
What is it?

42:21.622 --> 42:22.957
Just listen. Don't freak out.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.084
I just met up with my mom…

43:24.893 --> 43:25.728
Hello?

43:28.981 --> 43:30.065
What's that sound?

43:31.442 --> 43:32.276
Kang Sang-ung.

43:39.700 --> 43:40.909
Don't push!

43:43.829 --> 43:45.539
Where did it all start to go wrong?

43:58.218 --> 43:59.762
Someone has to do it.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.349
It's time for you to keep it going.

44:03.849 --> 44:05.726
Quietly help those in need.

44:05.809 --> 44:06.769
I don't want to!

44:17.029 --> 44:19.031
Just don't live like your dad, okay?

44:19.740 --> 44:20.741
Sang-ung.

44:22.117 --> 44:23.494
Let's live a good life.

45:01.907 --> 45:03.867
Look behind you. What's that?

45:45.951 --> 45:47.411
Fuck.

46:04.678 --> 46:08.348
If you ask people
who've screwed up their lives

46:08.974 --> 46:10.893
when, how, and why it happened,

46:11.518 --> 46:14.146
each of them will give you
a different answer.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.198
But when you get down to it,

46:24.782 --> 46:27.159
people screw up their lives

46:28.035 --> 46:29.119
all because of money.

46:35.334 --> 46:36.335
What matters is

46:37.169 --> 46:38.754
how much.

47:11.161 --> 47:12.371
30 million won.

47:14.498 --> 47:18.001
My mother's whole life disappeared,

47:19.294 --> 47:20.671
just like that.

47:29.972 --> 47:30.973
Everyone made it!

47:35.686 --> 47:38.272
-The bus came back up!
-Wow. That's incredible.

47:38.355 --> 47:39.690
This is crazy.

47:39.773 --> 47:41.525
-Amazing.
-Wow.

47:41.608 --> 47:42.901
Nice!

47:44.069 --> 47:45.779
And I'm screwed.

47:51.285 --> 47:52.286
Totally

47:53.245 --> 47:54.246
screwed.

50:51.214 --> 50:56.219
