WEBVTT

00:17.017 --> 00:18.727
-Why the gun?
-We must bring him back.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.562
We can never let them take him.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.190
If it can't be stopped…

00:28.528 --> 00:30.030
elimination is the only option.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.346
Yeah, Dad. I caught him.

00:56.973 --> 00:57.974
"Caught"?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.728
I get it!

01:03.021 --> 01:05.356
I will take care of it myself.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.358
I shouldn't have come.

01:08.026 --> 01:08.985
Damn it.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.008
-Damn it.
-I'm curious about something.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.927
Can I ask?

01:37.514 --> 01:39.140
Why did you come here?

01:41.601 --> 01:43.728
I could kill you right now,

01:44.771 --> 01:46.856
and you wouldn't be able to fight back.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.653
It's not like I'd actually do it.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.949
I'm just saying I could.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.421
-Do it.
-Yes, ma'am.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.635
When you're done, just kill him.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.479
I came here…

02:32.694 --> 02:34.445
because I wanted a normal life.

02:37.073 --> 02:37.907
To do so…

02:40.160 --> 02:42.120
I need to unite with the other superhumans

02:43.288 --> 02:44.706
to fight against you

02:45.874 --> 02:47.667
and secure our safety…

02:49.669 --> 02:50.837
rights, and interests.

02:52.130 --> 02:52.964
What?

03:03.558 --> 03:06.436
I can't just sell something
I inherited from my parents.

03:10.940 --> 03:11.900
Don't you agree?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.124
Bun-mi. Now's the time.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.890
The money.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.333
Just kill him!

04:14.587 --> 04:15.838
What the fuck happened?

04:47.537 --> 04:48.913
Wanna know what happened?

04:49.914 --> 04:50.873
Well,

04:51.749 --> 04:53.751
I just followed my heart.

04:59.215 --> 05:03.052
Ever since the truce,
the Mundane Vanguard has been watching us.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.223
MUNDANE

05:14.856 --> 05:16.149
Given the circumstances,

05:16.232 --> 05:19.152
sneaking into their lab
without drawing their attention

05:19.235 --> 05:20.653
seemed impossible.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.656
The only way…

05:23.740 --> 05:24.991
Hey, Bun-mi.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.912
…was to deceive ourselves.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.956
Everyone, just follow your heart.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.709
Wait for the signal at the last moment.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.419
I trust you.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.054
Hey, I almost died!

05:46.137 --> 05:48.222
Who the hell came up
with this absurd plan?

05:48.306 --> 05:50.141
Well, I couldn't trust you.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.727
But you wrote "I trust you."

05:52.810 --> 05:54.312
That was meant for Bun-mi.

05:57.899 --> 05:58.733
Over there.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.194
There's the safe.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.626
You're good at opening safes now.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.170
The first time's hard.
The second? A breeze.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.260
This is…

07:08.261 --> 07:10.388
BEOMHA RANCH

07:20.106 --> 07:21.065
The documents.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.539
Hurry! Those guys are seriously…

08:22.877 --> 08:23.878
MY MIN-SUK

08:25.004 --> 08:25.838
Hey, what is it?

08:26.839 --> 08:28.508
-Our parents' first meeting.
-What?

08:29.008 --> 08:31.511
Our parents' meeting
will be the day after tomorrow.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.473
The day after tomorrow?
You're telling me this now?

08:35.556 --> 08:38.351
I just found a coupon
for a traditional Korean restaurant,

08:38.434 --> 08:39.393
so I bought it.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.020
It's 50% off.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.688
Hey, wait.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.106
Gosh. Wait a minute.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.067
No, my money!

08:46.150 --> 08:47.944
Oh God. No.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.570
No!

08:50.696 --> 08:52.657
What? You don't like it?

08:53.157 --> 08:56.202
This place is really expensive.
We can't go without a discount.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.162
All right, then.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.081
It's a coupon, so no refunds.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.999
Call your parents now and tell them.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.544
Dinner on Friday at 7:00 p.m.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.461
Okay.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.678
Jeez!

09:19.767 --> 09:20.685
Sang-ung, let's go!

09:22.562 --> 09:23.521
Okay.

09:40.913 --> 09:41.747
Still got alcohol?

09:42.373 --> 09:43.457
You got money?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.718
If a superhuman has no superpowers,

09:54.552 --> 09:55.928
they're just human.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.141
Now I kind of get what Dad meant.

10:00.891 --> 10:01.809
Superpowers?

10:02.476 --> 10:03.686
It's not a big deal.

10:27.918 --> 10:28.919
BEOMHA RANCH

10:39.847 --> 10:41.390
Are you okay?

11:06.415 --> 11:08.793
She's seriously nuts.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.127
Jeez.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.090
-Hurry.
-Let's get out.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.399
Seriously.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.591
Four billion won…

11:59.969 --> 12:01.595
just vanished before my eyes.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.014
Being broke is nothing new to you.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.808
With four billion won…

12:11.021 --> 12:12.189
Are you okay?

12:14.525 --> 12:15.484
Of course.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.989
I am the Cashero, after all.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.033
You must be crazy.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.043
These jerks have done
some illegal experiments.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.880
I'm not sure what they're after,

12:35.963 --> 12:38.883
but they're doing something
with our superpowers.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.768
A NEW BUSINESS MODEL
UTILIZING DEPENDENCY AND HALLUCINATION

12:49.435 --> 12:51.604
What is it? What are they doing?

12:51.687 --> 12:54.899
It seems like
they're going to make something.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.903
"In the process of restoring
the superpower protein…"

13:02.072 --> 13:02.907
Sang-ung.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.540
TO SANG-UNG

13:19.965 --> 13:22.176
"I admire the way you work for others

13:22.259 --> 13:24.595
even without recognition."

13:24.678 --> 13:27.807
"That's the kind of hero the world needs."

13:28.432 --> 13:29.517
"Jo Nathan."

13:31.519 --> 13:32.895
Jo Nathan?

13:34.855 --> 13:36.857
You have a great name.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.108
NAME: JO NATHAN

13:38.192 --> 13:39.318
Mr. Jo Nathan.

13:40.820 --> 13:44.698
I admire the way you work for others
even without recognition.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.326
The thing is,

13:47.409 --> 13:50.538
I'm also working quietly
to make a difference.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.000
JO NATHAN

14:16.939 --> 14:18.941
It's too bad, Jo Anna.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.695
Father would hate this.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.664
How does freedom feel?

14:36.333 --> 14:37.585
Not bad.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.178
The chairman already moved them all.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.638
To Gimhae Bank.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.015
It doesn't matter.

14:52.808 --> 14:55.102
What I want isn't here anyway.

14:57.938 --> 14:58.814
All set?

15:00.524 --> 15:01.483
Yes, of course.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.321
Let's get started.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.008
RESTRICTED AREA

15:30.763 --> 15:32.014
RESIDENCY FORM
APRIL 2025

15:39.271 --> 15:41.023
JO NATHAN
UNIT 2302, CHANGIL PARKTRIUM

15:44.318 --> 15:45.778
Is this Jo Nathan's place?

15:48.405 --> 15:49.531
By the way, mister,

15:49.615 --> 15:52.743
isn't it illegal for a civil servant
to look into someone's address?

15:53.744 --> 15:56.121
Yes, it's illegal.
Report me if you have a problem.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.414
Get ready.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.398
Jesus!

16:24.650 --> 16:25.901
No one's here.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.005
It seems like he hasn't moved in yet.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.759
He has.

17:19.079 --> 17:19.913
What?

17:20.622 --> 17:21.874
What is it? What's wrong?

17:22.958 --> 17:24.001
Wait a second.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.093
Gosh!

17:42.728 --> 17:44.188
My goodness! What's going on?

17:46.315 --> 17:47.149
It's him.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.077
Just like Whac-A-Mole,

17:58.577 --> 18:00.704
the moment you get rid
of one crazy villain,

18:01.288 --> 18:04.500
a new creative one pops up.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.243
STATEMENT OF HOUSING ACQUISITION FINANCING
AND OCCUPANCY PLAN

19:21.326 --> 19:23.328
REQUIRED DOCUMENT
FOR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION

19:23.412 --> 19:25.455
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION
CORPORATE DECLARATION

19:36.341 --> 19:37.676
Don't push yourself too hard.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.762
Have some rice and soup before bed.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.140
It was your turn to cook tonight.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.641
Come home early tomorrow.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.988
I wonder how all those superheroes
in movies

19:58.697 --> 20:02.159
juggle beating up all the bad guys,
keeping a family,

20:02.242 --> 20:03.952
and holding down a job?

20:06.246 --> 20:07.372
I admire them.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.473
It looks delicious.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.608
Mr. Kang.

20:35.984 --> 20:36.818
Seriously,

20:37.319 --> 20:40.656
what on earth have you been doing
for the police to come looking for you?

20:42.866 --> 20:45.744
There was a minor misunderstanding.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.997
Give me a full report

20:49.081 --> 20:51.500
on your unauthorized vehicle use
and leaving work early.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.254
You'll face the disciplinary committee.
Expect a pay cut as well.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.506
A pay cut?

20:58.006 --> 20:59.466
Why?

20:59.549 --> 21:01.176
Why else? It's the rule.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.220
-It's for three months.
-Three…

21:05.764 --> 21:07.182
Three whole months?

21:10.811 --> 21:13.021
If my salary were cut by a third,

21:13.522 --> 21:16.441
I'd barely meet the legal minimum
for one person to live on.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.236
And if Min-suk finds out about this,

21:19.861 --> 21:24.366
the minimum cost of living
will be the least of my problems.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.748
What? Why?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.001
You got more to say?

21:34.876 --> 21:35.794
Sir.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.964
Would you mind if I took a half-day

21:39.673 --> 21:41.758
and left early today?

21:47.764 --> 21:48.890
NOTICE TO APPEAR

21:55.397 --> 21:58.275
SUSPECT INTERROGATION REPORT

22:15.334 --> 22:17.544
Your name is Kang Sang-ung, correct?

22:17.627 --> 22:18.545
Yes.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.173
NAME: KANG SANG-UNG

22:22.215 --> 22:23.592
No need to answer directly.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.261
It's just a name.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.221
It could work against you.

22:29.056 --> 22:29.973
Just saying my name?

22:32.809 --> 22:35.729
You saw our faces
at the community center, didn't you?

22:37.272 --> 22:38.231
My client says

22:39.608 --> 22:40.859
that he doesn't recall.

22:44.905 --> 22:48.075
I feel like a chaebol chairman
at a hearing.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.789
-You're here.
-Yeah.

23:01.630 --> 23:02.631
Wait outside.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.275
It's been a while.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.153
I knew it was you.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.696
Are you still doing that crap?

23:27.322 --> 23:28.448
Of course.

23:29.074 --> 23:29.950
Someone has to.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.705
Is it this guy this time?

23:36.289 --> 23:37.416
-Hey!
-Yes?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.546
What the hell were you thinking?

23:42.629 --> 23:43.713
You're married.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.258
What are you, a cop? A firefighter?

23:46.341 --> 23:49.094
No, I'm just nobody--

23:53.223 --> 23:54.933
Let me give you some advice.

23:57.811 --> 23:58.645
Stop this.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.650
If you cause trouble one more time,
I swear I'll put you in jail.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.734
Do you understand?

24:20.417 --> 24:22.127
Do you know that police officer?

24:27.716 --> 24:29.593
-He was a member of the society.
-Superpowers?

24:30.719 --> 24:32.012
Really?

24:32.512 --> 24:33.680
What was his superpower?

24:33.763 --> 24:35.348
Picking fights.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.644
By the way,

24:40.145 --> 24:41.813
why is he trying to capture me?

24:42.898 --> 24:45.817
-Is he with the Mundane Vanguard?
-Our beliefs don't quite align.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.027
It's fine. No worries.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.070
But I'm worried about it.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.698
-He said he'd put me in jail--
-I told you, it's fine!

25:47.212 --> 25:49.464
I'm good. I'm cutting carbs these days.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.343
What a load of crap.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.346
Take care of your health too.

25:56.429 --> 25:57.847
Gotta live a long life.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.768
You're just like you were
when you were a kid.

26:01.851 --> 26:04.104
Prattling on and running your mouth.

26:04.187 --> 26:07.774
Damn, I should have killed you back then.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.614
What happened?

26:55.697 --> 26:57.073
I drugged them.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.743
With the one that replicates superpowers.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.328
How do you know about that?

27:01.411 --> 27:03.413
Of course I know. I'm family too.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.918
Think of it
as a large-scale clinical trial.

27:09.002 --> 27:12.422
It's been on the news all day long.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.216
What good does it do us to draw attention?

27:15.300 --> 27:16.301
Dad.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.013
That bastard is doing it on purpose.
He wants us to go down.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.514
You're right.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.934
I did it on purpose.
So that Kang Sang-ung could see.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.229
What kind of bullshit is that?

27:30.940 --> 27:34.277
Father. Do you know
what the true essence of a hero is?

27:36.112 --> 27:37.405
It's meddling.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.201
Caring about things
that aren't even theirs.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.371
Not being able to ignore
what bothers them.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.086
He will come for me soon.

27:52.671 --> 27:56.174
At a time and a place
that works best for me.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.263
From now on,

28:03.223 --> 28:05.183
you take over the lab.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.312
Wait, Dad.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.774
When blood runs in the streets,

28:13.566 --> 28:15.568
our coffers fill.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.237
Let's eat.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.636
So you were questioned by the cops?

28:41.720 --> 28:44.806
Even if you end up in prison,
don't mention our names.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.058
I told you to stop joking around.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.518
I'm really serious.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.605
You read everything I handed out, right?

28:53.106 --> 28:54.691
This is the clinical trial list.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.116
Six of them jumped off yesterday.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.913
The Mundane Vanguard
is testing on civilians.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.378
MUNDANE

29:16.337 --> 29:19.007
The experiments are centered
around the clubs in Gangnam.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.635
Apparently, it's popular
for its intense hallucinations.

29:30.977 --> 29:33.146
A dealer called Hermes is the supplier.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.565
Their name is Hermes?

29:35.648 --> 29:36.858
HERMES AT CLUB MECENAT

29:38.067 --> 29:40.278
A different color designer bag every day.

29:41.154 --> 29:44.824
I got intel that Hermes will be
at Club Mecenat tomorrow afternoon.

29:45.658 --> 29:48.286
We catch Hermes as fast as we can
and retrieve the drugs.

29:49.329 --> 29:52.832
Once the trials are over, they'll start
replicating and selling superpowers.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.628
At all costs,
before there are more casualties…

29:59.214 --> 30:00.298
we must stop them.

30:02.008 --> 30:04.260
HOTTEST AFFORDABLE SPEC-UP NOW IN BULK
DEALER: HERMES

30:13.520 --> 30:15.104
I'm home.

30:15.605 --> 30:16.606
Hey.

30:18.775 --> 30:21.110
What's all this? Are we moving?

30:23.321 --> 30:24.322
Take your clothes off.

30:24.405 --> 30:25.824
-Right now?
-Yes.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.450
I don't have any cash.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.244
Should I go get some?

30:29.327 --> 30:32.038
What are you thinking?
We need to pick tomorrow's outfit.

30:32.121 --> 30:34.874
Oh, that's right. The family meeting.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.044
Why didn't you answer your phone?
Something happen?

30:39.504 --> 30:42.340
No, my phone was in my bag. Sorry.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.342
It has to go smoothly.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.594
The marriage plans got messed up.

30:47.095 --> 30:51.891
Marriage registration, housing lottery,
proposal, then parents meeting each other.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.143
If this meeting goes badly,

30:54.227 --> 30:59.607
everything that Min-suk and I have
worked towards will go down the drain.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.779
All right. This one's the best.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.739
-Go try it on.
-Okay.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.409
This looks pretty good.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.496
Hey, this is so expensive.
Why did you buy it?

31:13.580 --> 31:16.040
Our families will be meeting.
Don't wear it too often.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.170
1.29 million won?

31:23.339 --> 31:25.800
You don't even spend this much
on your own clothes.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.387
Everything good lately?

31:30.263 --> 31:32.140
Yeah, of course. All good.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.865
You look great. 7:00 p.m. at Jongno.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.408
Don't be late.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.118
All right.

31:58.541 --> 31:59.709
Here.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.922
-If traffic's bad, I'll just fly there.
-What?

32:04.005 --> 32:06.382
I'm giving it to you just in case.
Try not to use it.

32:06.466 --> 32:07.425
All right.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.596
-Can you give me 50,000 won more?
-No.

32:11.679 --> 32:12.680
Okay.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.974
-See you later.
-Okay.

32:15.767 --> 32:16.601
Bye.

32:19.812 --> 32:20.855
I'm off.

32:26.527 --> 32:28.237
One hour from Gangnam to Jongno.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.448
Catch Hermes by 6:00 p.m.

32:30.531 --> 32:33.242
and make it to the dinner at 7:00 p.m.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.327
I can do this.

32:55.848 --> 32:56.683
Where are you?

33:14.575 --> 33:15.618
We're in.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.082
Clubbing on the day
our parents are meeting?

33:21.958 --> 33:23.543
Unbelievable.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.136
What's with your outfit?

33:34.303 --> 33:37.015
Says the one dressed
for an old-school nightclub.

33:37.098 --> 33:40.476
An old-school nightclub?
Hey, this is an expensive outfit.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.915
They're all so passionate
about their lives.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.719
Where did you get that?

34:15.219 --> 34:16.679
That bar is selling it.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.723
The bracelet allows you
up to 5,000 won for free.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.478
Honestly, shouldn't stuff like this
be covered by the budget?

34:23.561 --> 34:25.980
I mean, we're always using our own money.

34:26.814 --> 34:28.107
Don't drink this.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.859
What's the priciest here? Order it.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.320
That's 100 million.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.078
Just drink this.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.957
So how are we supposed to find Hermes?

34:47.710 --> 34:49.087
ATTORNEY BYEON
IMAGE SENT

34:49.170 --> 34:50.088
FIND A RED BAG

34:52.423 --> 34:53.925
He wants us to find a red bag.

34:54.926 --> 34:55.760
Red?

35:03.392 --> 35:04.435
Red…

35:05.019 --> 35:07.480
I'm sorry. My mistake. I'm really sorry.

35:10.858 --> 35:11.859
That shape…

35:16.072 --> 35:17.073
I'm sorry.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.619
Damn it. So many red bags…

35:55.653 --> 35:57.155
They all look so similar.

35:57.905 --> 35:58.990
It's confusing.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.592
That one.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.637
-That's it, isn't it?
-It is.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.264
-Are you fucking nuts? Crazy bastard.
-What the fuck?

37:05.348 --> 37:06.474
You should just go today.

37:07.099 --> 37:08.643
Your next order will be free.

37:10.728 --> 37:11.562
Let's go, damn it.

37:28.079 --> 37:28.955
Perfect.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.998
I can make it to the meeting on time.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.337
You're Hermes, aren't you?

37:37.588 --> 37:38.756
Mr. Kang Sang-ung?

37:40.508 --> 37:43.386
I have some business with you.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.354
You made it all the way here.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.523
Honestly, I didn't think you could.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.441
What business? Tell me.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.986
She's speaking informally now.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.322
If things go wrong, I might be a bit late.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.493
I didn't know you were one of us.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.079
Wanna join the society too?

38:10.162 --> 38:14.542
We have tea and snacks on weekends.
I'll give you a sign-up form.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.386
Is this all you carry around?

38:26.721 --> 38:29.598
I recently got a pay cut.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.892
So things have been tough.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.960
You can never join the society now.

39:11.599 --> 39:15.394
Managing Director Jo Nathan
wants me to bring you over.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.271
That might be difficult.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.815
I have an important appointment later.

39:43.130 --> 39:43.964
Hey.

39:44.548 --> 39:45.758
Just hit me!

40:02.274 --> 40:05.152
I won't be able to see her anyway.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.233
Hey, mister!

40:44.942 --> 40:45.943
-This is nuts.
-What?

40:46.902 --> 40:48.279
What's with your clothes?

40:48.362 --> 40:49.238
Mr. Attorney.

40:50.823 --> 40:53.159
-Yes?
-Hermes is a superhuman.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.077
I've got the drugs, so we'll hurry out.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.412
Really? A superhuman?

40:56.495 --> 40:57.455
Yes, stay sharp.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.873
Let's get out of here.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.883
What? Because I told you
to let him hit you?

41:08.966 --> 41:11.802
If that's all he's got,
I think I can bring him in myself.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.436
That would be no fun.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.446
-I'm sorry.
-Coming through!

41:35.534 --> 41:37.244
Coming through, excuse us.

41:38.412 --> 41:39.538
What the hell?

41:40.456 --> 41:41.790
-What's this?
-What the hell?

41:45.586 --> 41:47.379
What's this? Some kind of surprise?

41:47.463 --> 41:48.380
What the hell?

42:35.094 --> 42:39.306
FOR YOU, WHO WORKS FOR OTHERS
EVEN WITHOUT RECOGNITION

42:53.988 --> 42:55.155
It's Jo Nathan.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.089
What is this?

43:33.944 --> 43:37.406
Clubs aren't usually like this, are they?

43:39.074 --> 43:43.203
Everyone wants to be someone special.

43:49.251 --> 43:50.210
What is this?

43:52.004 --> 43:53.672
YOU CAN BE SPECIAL TOO

44:03.557 --> 44:04.558
We should go.

44:11.482 --> 44:14.693
But speaking from experience,

44:15.194 --> 44:16.028
I swear,

44:16.820 --> 44:20.199
there's nothing better
than living a normal life.

44:28.624 --> 44:30.209
-Bun-mi!
-Hey, get him!

44:30.292 --> 44:32.294
Hey, get out of the way!

44:32.378 --> 44:35.005
Give it here! Get lost, you fucking bitch!

44:35.714 --> 44:37.007
Let go! Come on!

44:38.300 --> 44:39.218
Seriously!

44:40.219 --> 44:41.053
Get him!

44:41.136 --> 44:43.180
Hey, give me that!

44:45.349 --> 44:46.850
You fucking bitch!

44:46.934 --> 44:48.560
It's my bag!

44:49.395 --> 44:51.772
Give me that! Move!

44:57.444 --> 44:58.278
No!

45:02.533 --> 45:03.951
Fuck! No!

45:19.717 --> 45:24.012
If the drugs get taken away,
everyone will die.

45:26.765 --> 45:27.683
No.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.813
Being broke is a crime.

45:32.896 --> 45:33.897
Look at him.

45:34.481 --> 45:36.483
He can't do anything without money.

45:45.242 --> 45:46.076
No.

45:54.585 --> 45:55.669
Sang-ung.

46:00.466 --> 46:01.633
Sang-ung.

46:07.222 --> 46:08.182
Bun-mi!

46:24.156 --> 46:27.242
MY MIN-SUK

46:31.038 --> 46:33.999
The person you called is unavailable.
Please leave a message--

46:57.606 --> 47:00.526
Looks like I chose the wrong day…

47:03.153 --> 47:05.030
for our parents to meet.

50:03.250 --> 50:08.255
