[The Vendetta of An]

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.820
[Episode 25]

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.540
You're finally here.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.630
Yes, Master.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.500
I came to see you.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.610
Where is Xie Huai'an?

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.690
We survived.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.610
Huai'an is alive too.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.150
He told us

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.380
you would appear here.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.050
So we came.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.770
Master is from Tiemo.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.090
He wanted to kill Xiaoqing and me.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.020
Go on.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.930
Life or death,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.610
end it cleanly.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.530
Master.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.610
Put away your weapon.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.960
You raised us

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.180
for more than ten hard years.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.420
Will you not even spare

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.940
a moment to look at us,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.650
and hear a few words?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.290
Thrust.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.460
Block.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.720
Like this?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.440
Food's ready.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.490
Come taste Chef Ye's cooking today.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.040
If it's bad, it's free.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.050
Hurry, come here.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.730
Stop practicing.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.320
I'm starving.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.310
Your cooking is really good.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.050
Master,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.810
let us drink well tonight.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.430
Good.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.460
Xiaoqing.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.020
Mind your manners.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.490
Master hasn't taken the first bite.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.980
Thank you, Master.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.580
Master.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.220
You spoil her.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.540
Aren't you afraid no one will marry her?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.050
Here.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.700
Thank you, Master.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.660
Here, Zheng.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.350
Eat more.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.700
Xiaoqing.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.980
Let's toast Master together.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.580
All right.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.290
We wish Master good health.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.290
Good.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.100
Master, a toast to you.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.700
Good.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.100
Things have come to this.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.410
What more is there to say?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.250
People of Chang'an.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.900
People of Tiemo.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.600
Is the difference so great?

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.700
Forty years ago,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.540
I once had a son and a daughter.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.410
The winter in Tiemo was too harsh.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.490
They did not survive.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.100
Later,

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.980
war broke out again.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.050
I fled in panic.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.490
After that,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.980
I received orders

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.900
to enter Chang'an

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.140
as a shadow guard.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.610
I then served under General Liu Ziwen.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.380
A few years passed.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.170
In Basong Town,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.580
I found you and Xiaoqing.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.410
I raised you to adulthood.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.980
Taught you martial arts and medicine.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.220
I once believed

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.420
that I had another pair of children.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.780
But...

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.720
But I cannot forget.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.690
I cannot forget what I just said.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.890
War came again.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.540
I fled in haste.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.060
During that evacuation,

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.610
I never had the chance

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.990
to bury my children.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.700
If my homeland were still there,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.610
if the house had not collapsed,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.370
my son and daughter's remains

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.340
must still be there.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.980
With such memories in my heart,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.140
how could I care

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.860
about our past?

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.530
Master,

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.810
thank you for raising me.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.030
We understand now.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.330
We have no right to resent you.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.220
None of us has the right to hate another.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.610
If hatred must exist,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.650
let it be toward the merciless heavens.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.530
Children,

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.490
rise.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.980
If you intend to stop me from killing Xie Huai'an,

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.340
then you must

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.610
take my blade.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.770
Master.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.250
Master!

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.460
You were the ones who brought the rice.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.100
Right after I arrived at Cangshui River,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.220
I saw Master slip out at night,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.320
so I followed.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.370
Only then did I learn

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.220
Master kept two memorial tablets inside a cave.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.770
I did not know whose spirits you honored,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.820
but we thought

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.460
they must be dear to you.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.500
So Xiaoqing and I

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.980
would go there to pay respects from time to time.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.450
Now we understand.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.650
They were Master's children.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.450
But Master,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.050
we are your children too.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.290
Master,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.340
we are your children as well.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.220
Master.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.330
Master.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.630
People of Chang'an.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.290
People of Tiemo.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.980
Is the difference truly so great?

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.250
But Master,

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.860
we are your children too.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.060
Master.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.020
We are your children too.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.300
When Chang'an falls,

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.080
even in winter,

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.300
no Tiemo people will go hungry again.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.180
If only you were born in such a time,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.210
how wonderful it would be.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.970
What should I do?

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.150
Children...

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.060
What should I do?

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.780
Your identity has been exposed.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.240
As for your two disciples,

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.710
how do you plan to deal with them?

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.610
Your Majesty must know

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.210
why I followed you back then.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.810
Of course I know.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.730
Because your children

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.060
died in the winter of Tiemo.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.530
Tiemo's winters are bitter cold.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.540
So many children

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.220
never survive the harsh season.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.690
I believe you will not betray us,

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.380
because your children

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.340
watch over you

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.090
from the heavens.

not even laid to rest.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.940

White Hair.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:44.980
Mr. Long.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.370
My father once told me

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.740
that in a village at the foot of Wuxi Mountain,

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.980
before a house,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.460
there stood a stone hut of pale ash wood.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.570
There should be

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.850
two children's remains buried there.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.650
Seven years ago,

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.740
I went to Wuxi Mountain

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.740
and saved Pu Nichuan.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.980
I also visited that stone hut.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.090
Rest easy.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.300
Your children

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.980
have been laid to rest.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.320
In every letter, you wrote about how you

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.060
endured hardship

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.610
and wandered from place to place.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:18.540
Looking at you now,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.620
you held up well.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.980
White Hair,

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.330
your father and I

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.330
shared one wish.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.810
We only hoped you could live safely,

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.500
long enough to grow old and gray again.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:40.650
Child,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.260
come back alive.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.810
The King of Tiemo is gone.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.260
He cares nothing for your life or death.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:30.990
Let's go.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.230
Take it slow.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.530
Come on.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.140
Let's go.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.410
Xiaobing.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.410
You don't want to leave, do you?

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:50.740
Even if I don't, I must.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.850
I fear Tiemo's attack as well.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.960
But I still gave

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.220
someone my word, and haven't fulfilled it.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.090
Let's go.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.330
Xiaobing.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:31.980
What are you two doing?

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.060
Sir.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.810
His Majesty ordered me to protect you.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:36.940
If I give my word,

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.810
I will see it done.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.300
My sister and I will escort you to Huzhou.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.980
Look at these troubled times.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.540
Why must you two take such risks?

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.780
War is coming anyway.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.700
It's the same wherever we go.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.330
Huzhou is farther away.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.700
Perhaps the war won't reach there.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.800
Sir.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.890
Don't feel indebted.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.410
No...

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.330
In times like these,

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.130
common folk should help each other.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.410
Will this do?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.980
It will.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.060
Huzhou is far,

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.020
so maybe

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.610
we can avoid the war.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.780
Food, clothes, and expenses on the road

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:14.960
will all be my responsibility.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.410
Sir, don't stand on ceremony.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.500
- No. - You may command me

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.410
along the road as you wish.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.130
Serving tea, fetching water, massaging legs,

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:20.780
just call me.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.090
Treat me as your own son.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.570
Sir.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:30.540
Are you alright?

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.410
I'm fine.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:32.300
I'm fine,

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.890
child.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.330
Xiaobing, Xiaoding.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.020
Come.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.700
Take me to Huzhou.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.700
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:44.250
Come, over here.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.220
Come.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:02.610
Come on.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.850
Let's head off.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:49.920
How?

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.280
Are you alright?

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:14.330
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.090
Is the porridge ready?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.650
Sorry to keep you waiting. It's ready.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.670
The Emperor of the Xiao line

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.980
is now in the King of Tiemo's hands.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.780
Chang'an is hanging

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.370
by a thread now.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.260
Even on the brink, we still eat porridge.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.500
The battle must have gone terribly.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.650
It truly was a heavy defeat.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.570
At least we still have porridge.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.740
I thought

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.060
I would never see the Grand Preceptor again.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.300
You will not see the Grand Preceptor.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.330
What you see is Cen Pickles.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.300
[Cen Weizong]

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.220
Ye Zheng.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:26.130
Eat your porridge.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.370
You remember me?

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.170
Child, have a bowl.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:32.980
Warm yourself.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.860
Old sir,

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.100
why is your courtyard

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.690
full of pickles?

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.140
Winters are long.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.650
Fresh food won't last in the cellar.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.830
Pickling them

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.970
brings out a richer taste.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.860
I met your master when we were young.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.890
After I retired from the world,

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.890
we lost touch.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.910
I remember when he took you two in,

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.490
he said he might live in Chang'an forever.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.290
I naively believed

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.650
he would forget the past.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.690
Now all has returned to dust.

00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:57.295
(Watch on www.dramacool.club to support Admin)

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.330
Remember his kindness.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.870
That is enough.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.420
With that in your hearts,

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.420
you will find peace.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.460
Do not blame him.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.070
You,

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.110
and Gu Yu,

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.290
both remarkable people.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.790
Gu Yu survived thirty days on dry buns alone.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.100
I think you outdo him.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.020
You could last thirty days

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.410
without food or water.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:53.520
This is Ronghua Alley?

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.380
Yes, and all the neighbors

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.140
around here are trustworthy.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.580
For years,

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:04.820
I bribed them with pickles.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:06.720
Staying here

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.140
will keep you safe for a few days.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:13.860
You might not stay safe for long.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.970
There is something

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.490
I wish to ask of you.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.290
I know.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.930
I return to the palace tonight for duty.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:32.820
Chang'an is about to change.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.650
Please find a way

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.490
for that person to survive.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.650
That child is no concern of yours.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.340
I will see to proper arrangements.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.330
What you should consider

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.060
is a path of survival for yourself.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.500
Ye Zheng told me

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.330
you struck a bargain with Yan Fengshan's men.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.220
If you defeat the Tiemo forces,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.700
they may take your head.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:13.980
Yes.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.500
If you defeat Tiemo,

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.500
you die.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.500
If you drive them away,

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.170
you still die.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.060
White Hair.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:27.700
Have you ever wondered

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.570
what you have lived for

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.650
all your life?

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.410
If you can understand this,

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.610
then no matter whether there is

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.420
a way out of your dead end,

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:43.730
your life will not have been in vain.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.980
My thanks, Grand Preceptor.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.370
The sky has yet to brighten.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.180
Will you not take a lantern?

00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.980
No need.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.250
I walk as dust upon the world,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.680
and heaven and earth bear the light for me.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.730
I faintly sensed

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.490
the Grand Preceptor was the one who saved me.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.610
That night,

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:48.860
after Su Changlin wounded me,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:52.020
then...

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.090
Yes.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.090
It was him.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.940
The Grand Preceptor saved me.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.300
Huai'an,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.850
he is someone we can trust, isn't he?

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.440
Fifteen years ago, on the night the Liu family was slaughtered,

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.420
he should have died there.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.430
My father

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.420
hung a red ribbon on a tree,

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.770
warning him that the Huben Army had mutinied,

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.250
and thus he escaped death.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.090
Yan Fengshan and the King of Tiemo

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.130
betrayed my father,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.230
and betrayed the Grand Preceptor.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.210
Those who share an enemy

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.530
can at least trust each other.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.420
The army has pushed three hundred li

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:23.570
past the North Office.

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:26.560
Yet the four regional commanders who hold great legions

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.940
have made no move.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.290
No rations prepared,

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.940
no troops mobilized,

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.440
as if they have chosen to sit and watch.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.020
We have two hundred thousand soldiers,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.690
hardly a lone force charging deep.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.730
And with Xiao Wuyang

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.770
already in our hands.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.210
Your Majesty,

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.460
we can take Chang'an now.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.040
Hold on to it.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.060
Thank you.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.570
Urgent military report to the central court!

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:17.390
- How much for a flatbread? - Clear

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.150
- One wen each. - the way!

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.070
Urgent military report to the central court!

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.010
Clear the way!

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:21.850
Watch where you're going.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.730
- Urgent military report to the central court! - Take care.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:24.810
- Clear the way! - Lately,

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:25.800
news has been pouring in fast.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:27.820
They say the Tiemo people

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.110
have reached the North Office.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.220
And I heard at Changle Post outside the city,

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:31.920
everyone was killed.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.610
Could be the Tiemo people

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:34.710
are already near Chang'an.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.250
I also heard

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.290
there's a place outside the city called Cangshui River,

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:40.800
and I heard many

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.080
were killed there as well.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.210
Truly too tragic.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.860
These are troubled times indeed.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.490
The war reports come faster each day.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.880
Soon we will see the Tiemo horses at the gate.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.010
Yet Xie Huai'an, who holds the command, is nowhere to be found.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.220
Even His Majesty's fate is uncertain.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.230
And so we wait here,

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.290
letting grain and fodder go to waste.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:27.350
If you ask me,

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.230
we should march north

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:30.190
and fight the Tiemo head-on.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:33.430
Did you read the report?

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.160
The Tiemo drove straight in.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.140
The Baiwenhu Army fell quickly,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.730
and none of the regional commanders moved.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.410
If we rush out now

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:43.140
and fight,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.810
what if we lose?

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.500
Then what of Chang'an?

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:54.690
I believe His Majesty still lives.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.170
I believe in

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.500
Mr. Xie Huai'an as well, the one who holds the command.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:00.730
He must have a plan.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.650
Even Yan Fengshan, the man no blade could kill,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.170
fell to him in the end.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.170
Would the Tiemo be harder to fight than Yan Fengshan?

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.060
Maybe.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:15.330
But panicking will not help us.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.290
We wait.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.940
Military grounds.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.000
No unauthorized entry.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.250
I request to see the generals.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.620
The Wuyang Token belongs to Mr. Xie Huai'an.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.770
Did he send you?

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.180
I...

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.060
No.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.060
I come on behalf of the King of Tiemo.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:31.640
Speak clearly.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.580
Generals,

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:53.060
you have followed His Majesty for many years.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.020
The scar on the arm

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.170
is real.

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:11.920
This...

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.900
I believe you

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.420
recognize it.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.170
Where is His Majesty?

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:23.880
Tell me.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.500
Where is His Majesty?

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.480
The King of Tiemo

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.370
sent me here

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.560
with a message.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:12.290
Chang'an will fall.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.090
The Wuyang Army must not storm the city.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.420
If you refuse,

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.290
His Majesty dies.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:24.650
What?

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:26.700
Impossible.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.340
The Tiemo are still five hundred li away.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.870
Their shadow guards are already inside the city.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.900
They are using Huben tactics now.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.250
The Wuyang Army must not attack.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.020
If you do,

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.650
the Emperor will die.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.250
When will the Tiemo strike?

00:40:59.070 --> 00:40:59.980
I fear

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:04.130
we are already too late.
