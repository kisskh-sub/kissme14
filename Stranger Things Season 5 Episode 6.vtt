00:10.719 --> 00:13.888
Jonathan! Nancy! Jonathan!

00:14.764 --> 00:16.349
Jonathan! Nancy!

00:17.726 --> 00:19.436
What the hell are you doing?

00:19.519 --> 00:22.689
Listen to me! Don't touch anything!

00:36.536 --> 00:37.787
Maybe you missed?

00:54.763 --> 00:56.723
-Maybe we should, uh…
-Yeah.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.353
Before you say anything,
I know it's 5:00 in the morning,

01:43.436 --> 01:45.396
but I need you
to build me a telemetry tracker.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.273
What? Erica, it is--

01:47.357 --> 01:49.359
Five in the morning.
She led with that, buddy.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.611
I'm sorry. Who are you?

01:51.694 --> 01:53.738
-My uncle.
-Babysitter. Babysitter.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.115
Who is it, snookums?

01:55.198 --> 01:59.035
It's okay, sugar lump. Go back to bed.
I'll just be one second.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.328
Okay.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.663
The librarian?

02:01.746 --> 02:03.832
You get too loud in the sack,
she shush you?

02:03.915 --> 02:10.171
Okay, listen. You and whoever you are,
this is highly inappropriate.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.340
I will see you in class, Erica.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.343
Dustin is in danger.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.138
Danger? What kind of danger?

02:18.221 --> 02:19.848
Like the life or death kind.

02:19.931 --> 02:23.017
What do you say, snookums?
You gonna keep playing with your bookworm,

02:23.101 --> 02:26.062
or you gonna build us our tracker
and save your star student?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.233
Henderson!

02:30.942 --> 02:32.277
Dustin!

02:32.360 --> 02:34.737
Dustin. Hey. What the hell was that?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.990
Was that the shield generator?
Did they find it?

02:37.073 --> 02:38.324
I was wrong.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.285
I was terribly,

02:41.619 --> 02:43.037
catastrophically wrong.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.205
What?

02:44.289 --> 02:46.332
After you left, I found a journal.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.626
Brenner's journal.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.381
The key to destroying that wall
is in this lab,

02:53.464 --> 02:56.050
but it is not a shield generator.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.636
It isn't dark magic. Vecna didn't make it.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.391
Science did.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.979
Theoretical physicists call it
exotic matter.

03:08.479 --> 03:12.066
A single source of energy
that is holding that giant wall together,

03:12.150 --> 03:14.569
and I think Nancy just shot it.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.541
How is that bad? That's why
we're here, to get through this wall.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.627
-You are not listening!
-I am listening.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.254
Vecna didn't make the wall.
So he isn't on the other side,

03:33.338 --> 03:36.299
which means Holly and the missing kids
aren't either. Nobody is.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.636
Then what the hell is
on the other side of that wall?

03:49.812 --> 03:51.105
Why'd it stop?

03:57.779 --> 04:00.031
Dustin, what's on the other side
of the wall?

04:00.823 --> 04:01.658
Death.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.120
Whoa.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.504
Come on! Come on, let's go!

04:15.421 --> 04:16.798
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

04:17.507 --> 04:18.633
Let's go! Let's go!

04:19.342 --> 04:20.468
Get down! Get down!

04:30.687 --> 04:32.397
This whole time,

04:32.480 --> 04:35.650
everything we have ever assumed
about the Upside Down has been

04:36.484 --> 04:37.944
dead wrong.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.534
The gate!

04:44.617 --> 04:45.743
The gate!

04:46.869 --> 04:48.663
I can clear a path!

04:48.746 --> 04:52.834
No, no, no!
You stay behind... stay behind me!

04:52.917 --> 04:54.919
No! Goddamnit!

05:04.345 --> 05:05.346
No!

05:06.014 --> 05:07.056
No! No!

05:19.777 --> 05:22.405
This place, the Upside Down,

05:22.488 --> 05:25.992
it isn't another dimension.
It's not another world.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.702
It's a wormhole.

05:27.785 --> 05:28.786
A bridge

05:29.662 --> 05:33.791
between two points in time and space,
between our world and another.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.460
And if the bridge collapses?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.378
It will take us with it.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.049
All of us.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.503
Go, go, go, go!

07:47.467 --> 07:50.386
Are you okay? Are you okay? It's okay.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.306
We're safe here.
He can't get us here, okay?

07:53.389 --> 07:54.390
Max…

08:03.858 --> 08:05.109
Holly!

08:05.860 --> 08:06.861
Come on.

08:10.823 --> 08:14.076
Holly, sweetheart. Stop, or I'll hurt her.

08:16.204 --> 08:20.416
I know you believe Max is your friend.

08:21.042 --> 08:25.254
But she has tricked you, Holly.
She has corrupted your mind.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.215
She is a liar.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.634
No! No, you're the liar!

08:29.717 --> 08:32.011
I saw you! I saw what you really are!

08:32.094 --> 08:35.306
You're a monster! A disgusting monster!

08:35.389 --> 08:36.849
Holly!

08:36.933 --> 08:40.520
If you don't come back with me right now
and rejoin the other children,

08:40.603 --> 08:43.272
I will have no choice but to hurt Max.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.153
I may even have to kill her.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.405
Then why don't you? Huh?

08:52.156 --> 08:53.074
I'm right here.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.909
Oh, that's right.

08:54.992 --> 08:59.288
You're too scared of a stupid cave,
you goddamn coward!

08:59.956 --> 09:02.792
Things have changed, Max.

09:03.834 --> 09:07.255
There are now other ways to get to you.

09:07.838 --> 09:08.923
And Holly?

09:09.966 --> 09:13.177
When your new friend begins to suffer,

09:14.595 --> 09:16.180
and she will suffer,

09:16.973 --> 09:20.184
you can either return to me
and end her suffering,

09:21.018 --> 09:23.396
or you can watch your new friend die.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.982
Her life is in your hands.

10:10.401 --> 10:14.947
Can someone please explain to me
what the hell happened out there?

10:15.031 --> 10:18.743
We burnt out the particles.
I watched them fly up the tower.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.245
-I mean, you guys saw that, right?
-Hard to miss.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.623
So Will should be unplugged
from the hive mind.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.791
-Theoretically.
-But why didn't he wake up?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.752
How did he see Max if she's with Holly?

10:27.835 --> 10:30.630
Is this real?
Is Vecna messing with us again?

10:30.713 --> 10:32.506
This makes no goddamn sense!

10:32.590 --> 10:37.094
The doctors, they never understood
why Max was in the coma, right?

10:37.178 --> 10:38.721
What? No. Why?

10:40.848 --> 10:43.934
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.730
So let's just assume for a second
that everything that Will saw was real.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.066
-He saw Max. He saw Holly.
-Yeah, but how?

10:50.149 --> 10:53.194
I'm getting to that. Let's say that, uh…

10:54.070 --> 10:55.321
this is Will,

10:55.404 --> 10:58.824
and this is Holly.

10:58.908 --> 10:59.784
And…

11:00.368 --> 11:03.621
uh, this, of course, is Max.

11:04.580 --> 11:07.416
They're in three disparate locations,
the Squawk, the hospital,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.752
and some presently unknown place
in the Upside Down. Right?

11:09.835 --> 11:11.045
-Right.
-Yeah.

11:11.128 --> 11:14.799
But they share one very essential thing
in common.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.217
They're all unconscious.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.179
What happens when Vecna captures you?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.056
You go into a trance.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.225
Which would look
a heck of a lot like a coma.

11:24.308 --> 11:27.478
No wonder the doctors are so clueless.
Max was never in a coma.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.188
She was in a trance.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.692
Just like Will. Just like Holly.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.487
It is hitting me
like a Whitney Houston high note.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.155
What if their minds…

11:39.281 --> 11:40.700
are all in the same place?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.077
In Vecna's mind.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.538
Imprisoned.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.290
At least, they were.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.583
If Will's right,

11:49.667 --> 11:53.754
then Max and Holly
are now making a prison break.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.297
And if they succeed,

11:55.381 --> 11:58.759
they will return to their physical bodies,

11:59.552 --> 12:02.388
and Max will come back to life.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.266
And they'll have been
in Vecna's mind, literally.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.309
They'll know everything.
They'll know where Will is.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.603
-Where the kids are.
-They might even know what he's planning.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.732
-That's endgame.
-The fate of the planet may very well rest

12:12.815 --> 12:16.402
in the hands of your comatose girlfriend
and your baby sister.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.320
It's worth one more shot, right?

12:18.404 --> 12:19.947
-Can you drive?
-Not legally.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.116
Good enough.
Take Joyce's car. Do not get pulled over.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.701
Get to Max. I'll stay with Will.

12:23.784 --> 12:24.785
Okay.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.160
Do you remember this place…

13:07.661 --> 13:08.662
William?

13:10.915 --> 13:13.125
No, no, no…

13:13.209 --> 13:16.837
-Does it… bring back…
-No.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.593
memories?

13:23.719 --> 13:25.638
Max, Holly…

13:27.139 --> 13:28.808
They got away, didn't they?

13:30.226 --> 13:32.228
Did the leg slow you down?

13:32.311 --> 13:35.397
You think you are clever, don't you?

13:35.981 --> 13:41.320
But remember, I am the one.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.365
The one who invited you in.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.285
You were my vessel.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.746
My spy.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.083
My builder.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.377
Builder?

13:59.755 --> 14:03.217
How do you think the tunnels came to be,
William?

14:05.886 --> 14:08.889
You built them

14:08.973 --> 14:13.561
each and every night you slept.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.820
There is much power within you.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.365
But make no mistake, boy.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.327
They are my powers,

14:30.411 --> 14:34.623
and they are stronger than ever before.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.547
Much stronger.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.268
Now, at last, it is time.

14:55.394 --> 15:01.066
Time for my vessels
to lead us to a new world.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.403
A better world.

15:05.321 --> 15:09.992
Too bad your world will never exist,

15:10.075 --> 15:13.078
now that Max has one of your vessels.

15:13.662 --> 15:17.791
There are ways
to smoke a fox from its den, William.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.294
And you are going to help me.

15:20.377 --> 15:25.049
You are going to be my spy

15:25.132 --> 15:29.094
one last time.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.095
No.

15:30.679 --> 15:31.555
Never.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.777
The more you resist…

15:46.195 --> 15:48.739
the more this will hurt.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.767
Stupid.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.107
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

16:23.190 --> 16:24.566
Seeing if he's still out there.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.859
-He's not.
-How do you know?

16:25.943 --> 16:28.696
Because he knows he can't get us in here.
Let's go.

16:28.779 --> 16:32.032
He said that things had changed,
that there were other ways.

16:32.116 --> 16:35.160
Yeah, and he's totally full of shit.
You should know this by now.

16:35.244 --> 16:39.915
So we're supposed to what?
Just do nothing? Accept our fate?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.375
No, we're not accepting shit.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.711
We're just staying alive
until we're rescued.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.796
-Rescued by Eleven?
-Mm-hmm.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.256
How do you know that was even her?

16:47.339 --> 16:49.633
Unless you know somebody else
with psychic powers

16:49.717 --> 16:52.177
who's able
to remotely infiltrate Vecna's mind,

16:52.261 --> 16:56.306
fight him off, communicate through him
to tell us to run, then it had to be El.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.476
Which means she knows we're here,
and she'll come and she'll save us.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.645
Now, can you please stop pacing?

17:01.729 --> 17:04.273
Seriously, you're starting
to remind me of your brother.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.278
Thank you.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.953
Why can't Henry come in here anyway?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.246
I don't know.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.750
You've had two years with nothing to do.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.461
You must have a theory.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.967
If we're just waiting,
we might as well talk.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.142
-This prison…
-Camazotz.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.269
Camazotz. Sure.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.232
It's made up of Henry's memories, right?

17:47.816 --> 17:50.444
Including this cave.

17:50.527 --> 17:54.198
So I figure it's like,

17:54.698 --> 17:56.909
I don't know,
a memory that, for whatever reason,

17:56.992 --> 17:59.328
Henry doesn't want to face.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.747
Something traumatic.

18:03.415 --> 18:07.711
Except there's nothing in here
that is even remotely scary, so…

18:08.420 --> 18:09.630
maybe not.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.509
Anyway, that's my theory.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.011
I like it.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.389
Thanks.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.851
And if you're right,

18:24.436 --> 18:27.439
maybe we can escape through this memory.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.358
-What?
-Okay, so…

18:30.234 --> 18:33.487
My house, your attic,
those were traumatic memories too,

18:33.570 --> 18:35.447
and they led us out of Camazotz.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.075
So maybe Henry's memory can too.

18:38.158 --> 18:41.036
First of all, there's nothing in here,
as I said.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.956
Secondly, our memories
weren't simply traumatic.

18:44.039 --> 18:47.543
They were memories of the precise moment
that Henry stole our minds.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.711
And he can't steal his own mind, can he?

18:49.795 --> 18:53.215
-How do you know?
-Because that makes no sense.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.551
And everything in this place makes sense?

18:57.719 --> 18:58.720
I mean,

18:59.721 --> 19:01.348
maybe there's like a…

19:02.182 --> 19:04.977
a secret passageway or something.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.355
Right, yes, I totally forgot
about the secret passage.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.235
What about out there?

19:13.318 --> 19:15.612
Sand. Lots of sand.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.489
-You've searched it?
-Yes.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.366
-All of it?
-It goes on for miles.

19:19.950 --> 19:20.951
So, no.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.455
You are not going out there.

19:25.539 --> 19:29.334
Holly, we're staying here,
and we wait for Eleven, end of story.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.752
I don't think Henry was bluffing

19:30.836 --> 19:32.921
when he said
there's another way to get to you.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.133
We have to find a way out of here
before that happens.

19:36.925 --> 19:37.843
You coming?

19:38.427 --> 19:41.180
Or are you gonna let
a child head into the desert unsupervised?

19:42.681 --> 19:43.765
I take it back.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.311
You don't remind me of your brother.
You are your brother!

20:01.241 --> 20:02.242
Joyce?

20:03.660 --> 20:04.995
Did someone call the funeral home?

20:16.465 --> 20:17.716
Mike.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.262
El!

20:22.346 --> 20:23.555
Oh, Mike…

20:30.854 --> 20:32.064
I'm here now.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.316
You're okay.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.567
I'm okay.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.070
This is Kali,

20:38.654 --> 20:39.863
my sister.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.615
And this must be the famous Mike.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.660
I don't… I don't understand.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.163
It's a long story.
Probably best just to tell it once.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.124
Where's the rest of our greeting party?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.089
He's just in here.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.806
Oh, Jesus.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.100
How long has he been like this?

21:08.183 --> 21:09.268
A few hours.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.021
Do you think you can find him?

21:19.027 --> 21:21.613
Any clue in there about how long
it takes a wormhole to collapse?

21:21.697 --> 21:22.698
Ten minutes, maybe 20?

21:22.781 --> 21:24.866
I thought it'd be instantaneous.
Clearly not.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.077
-Why do you sound disappointed?
-I'm not disappointed.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.912
-You sound disappointed.
-I'm confused.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.290
As far as I see it,
there are two possibilities.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.001
Either this is the afterlife,
and you and I are spirits.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.127
-Which seems unlikely.
-Ooh.

21:35.210 --> 21:39.423
Or Nancy didn't completely destroy
the exotic matter.

21:39.506 --> 21:42.801
Because if she did, the walls
of the wormhole would have collapsed.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.928
And we would have been sucked
into oblivion.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.055
Okay, so what
are we waiting around here for?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.181
Where are you going?

21:48.265 --> 21:50.934
To see if I can get a damn signal
to find Nancy.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.769
-Steve, wait.
-Let's go, Henderson.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.146
-Wait!
-Let's go.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.482
Steve, we don't know if it's safe up here.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.359
You said
the exotic matter wasn't destroyed.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.403
No, I said
it was not completely destroyed.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.655
But it was very clearly disturbed.

22:03.739 --> 22:07.909
We have no idea what effect this will have
on matter, space-time, gravity.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.745
This whole building could very well be

22:09.828 --> 22:12.456
a highly unstable,
physics-defying death trap.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.166
It seems pretty stable to me.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.960
Nancy, you copy? Jonathan, are you there?

22:17.961 --> 22:18.837
Hello?

22:22.549 --> 22:24.426
Mother of God.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.770
Please tell me they're not up there.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.880
No, no, no, no. No! Nancy!

23:05.175 --> 23:07.594
Nancy! No, no, no.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.637
Nancy!

23:08.720 --> 23:10.806
Come on. Nancy.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.808
Come on. Come on.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.602
-Are you okay? Are you okay? Okay.
-Yeah. I think so.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.479
What happened?

23:18.355 --> 23:19.898
I don't know. I don't know.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.068
I guess we fell.

23:23.151 --> 23:25.195
And also clearly didn't destroy it.

23:25.278 --> 23:26.780
Just pissed it off.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.450
Come on. Let's go.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.871
Let's get the hell out of here.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.584
-Where's the door?
-Shit, shit.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.337
It's there. Come on.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.300
Shit!

23:50.178 --> 23:53.723
No, no, no! Shit! Shit! No, no, no, no!

23:56.643 --> 23:58.145
Goddamnit.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.856
Come on!

24:22.002 --> 24:25.505
Nancy, she didn't leave
a note or anything at the church?

24:25.589 --> 24:28.175
No. No, nothing.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.636
Which means they're either
a bunch of inconsiderate pricks,

24:32.220 --> 24:34.097
or they got captured by the military.

24:34.181 --> 24:37.809
To put your mind at ease, I am heavily
leaning on the inconsiderate prick theory.

24:37.893 --> 24:41.480
Wait, and that flesh wall you found,
you don't think…

24:41.563 --> 24:44.274
They got sucked into
the giant vacuum cleaner? No, I don't.

24:45.358 --> 24:48.528
But I don't really know, Mike.
I'm as confused as you.

24:49.237 --> 24:54.451
This whole thing, Max, Holly, this wall,
it's all gotta connect somehow,

24:54.534 --> 24:55.577
but I can't figure out how.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.788
It's like
there's a missing piece of the puzzle.

24:58.872 --> 24:59.748
A big piece.

24:59.831 --> 25:03.460
The pieces are in Vecna's mind,
and now we finally have a way to get in.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.629
Except Jane hasn't found anything.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.508
Oh, boy! Here comes Pollyanna
to brighten everybody's day.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.092
She's struggling up there.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.303
Oh, yeah?
Maybe you should give her some time.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.472
She's getting weaker, not stronger.

25:15.555 --> 25:19.017
So you are the expert on El, huh?

25:19.100 --> 25:20.977
You've known her for what,
a day and a half?

25:21.061 --> 25:23.188
Longer than you, actually.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.983
We were raised together,
and her name is Jane.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.027
-Jane Hopper.
-I'm just here to help.

25:29.110 --> 25:32.322
You're just here to help.
Well, I'm sorry I'm all out of gratitude.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.115
I thought you said
this fight was pointless.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.951
You said this whole thing was pointless?

25:36.034 --> 25:37.327
I never said that.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.372
Really? It sure as shit sounded to me
like you did.

25:40.455 --> 25:43.250
I leave you alone for two seconds with El,
and you worm your way into her head.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.503
She's probably having trouble finding Will
because you've thrown her off track.

25:46.586 --> 25:49.464
She was off track when I met her
because of you.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.882
Because of your lies.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.384
Everything I have done…

25:52.467 --> 25:55.512
…is to protect her.
Keep telling yourself that,

25:55.595 --> 25:58.807
but if you really want to protect her,
she needs to know the truth,

25:58.890 --> 26:01.851
and she needs to be ready
to deal with what's waiting for her

26:01.935 --> 26:03.645
on the other side of this.

26:04.145 --> 26:07.357
Killing Henry won't end this.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.400
What does that mean?

26:08.483 --> 26:13.238
It means nothing. She's a child.
She has no idea what she's talking about.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.115
She's talking a bunch of nonsense.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.158
I think you know I'm not.

26:18.368 --> 26:22.706
But just as you lie to Jane,
you also lie to yourself.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.752
You ask why I'm still here?

26:29.504 --> 26:34.467
I'm here to make sure
that this never happens again.

26:41.057 --> 26:41.891
El.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.314
El!

26:48.023 --> 26:49.691
Hey, is everything okay?

26:50.984 --> 26:53.695
I can't reach him. He keeps slipping away.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.780
Well, we have plenty of food in there,

26:55.864 --> 26:58.950
so eat, rest, and recharge your battery,
and we'll try it again.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.035
Or…

27:00.952 --> 27:02.412
we improve your signal.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.789
-The tank.
-Yeah. It'll take a while to set up.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.750
But you've gotta
recharge your battery anyway.

27:06.833 --> 27:10.545
Plus, that thing was a pain to build,
so I'd like to get some use out of it.

27:18.386 --> 27:21.181
-Doris, I'm gonna sign in later.
-I'm here for emotional support.

27:21.264 --> 27:23.266
Miss Buckley! Miss Buckley!

27:23.350 --> 27:25.560
Oh! You know what?

27:28.104 --> 27:29.230
Hey.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.940
-We need to talk.
-Yeah.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.068
-Wait, Robin!
-I've gotta deal with this. Just go!

27:33.151 --> 27:34.152
What about the plan?

27:34.235 --> 27:35.403
Vickie.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.783
Listen, I know you're pissed,
and you have every right to be.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.660
-They're looking for you.
-Who is looking for me?

27:41.743 --> 27:43.662
-Security. MPs.
-Why?

27:43.745 --> 27:46.122
-You wanna play dumb?
-I have no idea what you're talking about.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.832
Okay, all right, let me give you a hint.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.377
You, Mr. Bailey's room, benzos.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.504
Well, does it ring a bell yet?

27:52.587 --> 27:57.467
Robin, you've gotta start telling me
what is going on with you right now.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.975
Okay, Max, time to come home.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.284
I think we've been at this long enough.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.412
We've searched an inch of this place.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.414
At last, you get my point.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.542
I've spent I don't know how long
searching out here, but too long.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.628
You're not gonna just suddenly find
something that I haven't, okay?

28:33.712 --> 28:36.548
Did my brother ever tell you
about Uncle Eric?

28:36.631 --> 28:37.799
Uncle Eric?

28:37.882 --> 28:40.385
He's a metal detectorist.
Do you know what that is?

28:40.468 --> 28:41.761
He searches for metal.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.596
Yeah, with his metal detector.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.267
Looking for super old treasures and stuff
that dead people have left in the ground.

28:47.350 --> 28:50.478
Anyway, his favorite place to search is
Indiana Beach Amusement Park.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.647
I mean, he searched there for years,

28:52.731 --> 28:55.066
but all he ever found
was a bunch of cheap trinkets.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.653
Then one day, he opens up the newspaper
and boom, front page,

28:58.737 --> 29:00.864
some random tourist found a tin can

29:00.947 --> 29:04.033
filled with gold and silver coins
worth like millions of dollars.

29:04.117 --> 29:07.328
Right, so let me guess,
in this scenario, I'm Uncle Eric…

29:07.412 --> 29:08.705
And I'm the tourist.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.300
So stupid.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.943
"M" marks the spot.

29:43.698 --> 29:45.283
-Where are you going?
-I have an idea.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.285
-What idea?
-I'll show you when we're closer.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.871
-Holly!
-You said you wanted to go back.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.581
Well, we're going back.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.295
Guys, if you can hear us, we're coming.
I repeat, we're coming.

29:57.378 --> 30:00.298
Steve, slow down! The higher we go,
the more dangerous it gets.

30:00.381 --> 30:02.050
All the more reason to speed up.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.260
We're no use to them if we're dead. Steve!

30:13.436 --> 30:14.729
As I was saying…

30:20.318 --> 30:21.319
Come on!

30:21.402 --> 30:22.862
Damn it!

30:30.245 --> 30:31.663
What are you doing?

30:31.746 --> 30:34.999
A few floors down, it looked like one
of those soldiers cut through that door.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.258
Watch out.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.222
Shit! Get back!

30:52.308 --> 30:53.977
Shit! Shit!

30:54.060 --> 30:55.228
Oh, God!

31:01.943 --> 31:02.944
Holy shit!

31:05.572 --> 31:08.074
The table! Get to the table!

31:18.459 --> 31:19.544
Now what?

31:26.009 --> 31:28.052
Help! Help!

31:28.136 --> 31:30.430
-Help! Help!
-Steve!

31:30.513 --> 31:33.641
-Help! Help!
-Hey! Help!

31:33.725 --> 31:36.853
-Help! Help! Help!
-Help! Help! Help!

32:12.013 --> 32:13.056
Almost ready out here.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.478
El's gonna fix this.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.813
She's gonna fix it.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.236
It was my idea, Hop.

32:28.571 --> 32:29.447
It was…

32:30.031 --> 32:32.575
my idea for him to go in there.

32:33.159 --> 32:35.620
I don't know. I just thought maybe,

32:35.703 --> 32:40.124
after everything that happened,
after everything I saw him do, that…

32:40.917 --> 32:43.252
I started thinking maybe all this time

32:43.336 --> 32:46.673
that I've been trying so hard
to protect him,

32:46.756 --> 32:49.258
I've really just been holding him back

32:51.010 --> 32:52.720
by not listening to him,

32:53.471 --> 32:55.181
not trusting him.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.683
And so if I just…

32:57.809 --> 33:01.437
I don't know.
If I just believed and let go,

33:01.521 --> 33:04.899
that, I don't know,
somehow this could all work out. And…

33:06.234 --> 33:11.364
It's like every choice
that I make is wrong.

33:11.447 --> 33:12.490
I know.

33:13.992 --> 33:18.162
I mean, you can push them into situations
they might not be ready for.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.832
You can be like me,
and you can be overprotective,

33:20.915 --> 33:23.251
and they just resent you for that.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.837
Joyce, one of the joys of being a parent…

33:28.381 --> 33:30.842
is that you'll have a constant reminder
your whole life

33:30.925 --> 33:32.719
that every choice you've made

33:33.511 --> 33:34.971
has been wrong.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.059
It's not on you, Joyce.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.188
It's not on you.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.165
That looks nice. Murray find that for you?

34:02.874 --> 34:03.875
Yeah.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.462
Santa Claus has good taste.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.385
Hey. Back at the Squawk,

34:15.136 --> 34:17.597
Kali, she said something weird

34:17.680 --> 34:20.850
about this not being over
even if we kill Henry.

34:20.933 --> 34:22.685
Do you know what she's talking about?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.146
It doesn't matter.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.190
I should warm this up.

34:27.815 --> 34:31.027
Okay, well, if it doesn't matter,
then why was Hop so angry at her?

34:31.110 --> 34:32.403
It's nothing, Mike, really.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.238
-Friends don't lie.
-I'm not lying.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.658
You're avoiding. That's a cheat.
I just want to help.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.203
You can't help. Not with this.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.080
Let me be the judge of that.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.416
El, come on.

34:50.379 --> 34:52.924
There's a lab in the Upside Down.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.551
They're restarting Papa's program.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.262
Trying to make new numbers.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.059
The military?

35:06.437 --> 35:07.730
Okay.

35:07.814 --> 35:11.943
So, after we kill Vecna,
we destroy this new lab.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.736
End the program. Like a side quest.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.239
Mike, no, you don't understand.

35:16.322 --> 35:19.450
They don't need a lab to make new numbers.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.827
Henry's blood.

35:22.495 --> 35:23.704
It's in me.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.498
I'm not a monster.

35:26.749 --> 35:28.209
I know that now.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.837
But with me, with my blood,

35:32.004 --> 35:34.382
they can make more monsters.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.718
They can make more Henrys.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.263
The military will always be looking
for you.

35:40.346 --> 35:43.391
We've always known that.
Which is why we aren't staying in Hawkins.

35:43.474 --> 35:46.352
When this is all over, we're leaving.

35:46.435 --> 35:49.313
Escaping to some far off land. Remember?

35:49.397 --> 35:51.566
Somewhere where they can't find us.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.444
Somewhere
where there's at least one waterfall.

35:56.445 --> 35:57.446
Mike.

35:59.240 --> 36:02.493
This isn't like one of your campaigns.

36:03.619 --> 36:05.371
You don't get to write the ending.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.331
Not this time.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.334
Maybe I don't.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.670
But we do.

36:12.753 --> 36:16.215
You, me, Lucas, Will, and Dustin.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.342
Because this is our story.

36:19.468 --> 36:21.804
And it starts with getting Will back.

36:38.154 --> 36:38.988
Max.

36:49.165 --> 36:52.418
You realize you don't need
your spyglass anymore? That's my cave.

36:52.501 --> 36:53.336
Yep.

36:53.419 --> 36:54.962
Also, the cap is still on.

36:55.463 --> 36:56.464
Yep.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.382
Look.

36:59.717 --> 37:00.801
Cap on.

37:06.098 --> 37:08.059
Okay, it's very dark.

37:08.142 --> 37:09.060
But not totally.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.645
You see that cutout of light?

37:10.728 --> 37:12.897
It's in the same shape
as the cave entrance.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.524
What are the chances
it cracks in the same shape as the cave,

37:15.608 --> 37:17.318
the cave we know Henry visited?

37:17.401 --> 37:20.696
I think the cap is a map,
a map Henry made when he was young,

37:20.780 --> 37:23.199
a map that'll lead us
to some kind of secret location.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.285
We just have to get the shapes to line up.

37:27.536 --> 37:30.039
And you think in this secret location,
we'll find what?

37:30.122 --> 37:31.582
Henry's traumatic memory?

37:31.666 --> 37:34.168
That. And a way out of Camazotz.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.296
At least… that's my theory.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.715
-I like it.
-Thanks.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.009
There's one tiny hole
in your theory, though.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.804
We're near the secret location,
and I've got eyes,

37:44.887 --> 37:48.140
and I still see absolutely nothing
but more goddamn sand--

37:50.977 --> 37:51.852
Hold on!

37:52.645 --> 37:53.896
Hold on!

38:12.748 --> 38:14.083
"M" marks the spot.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.803
Vic, do you want
to maybe verbalize something?

38:25.886 --> 38:28.889
It's just unclear what your face
is trying to communicate here.

38:28.973 --> 38:32.935
I know that it's a lot to absorb,
especially all in one go.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.479
Monsters and alternate dimensions,

38:35.563 --> 38:39.150
and I realize that the drugging
of the Turnbows was a bit unethical--

38:39.233 --> 38:44.113
-Okay, stop, Robin. Please, just stop.
-I tried to tell you like a million times.

38:44.196 --> 38:47.992
No, you lied. And then you kept lying
over and over and over again.

38:48.075 --> 38:50.369
-I knew something was wrong.
-I know! I'm sorry!

38:50.453 --> 38:51.912
"Crazy day at work. Call you tomorrow."

38:51.996 --> 38:54.040
"Sorry, there's another crisis
at the Squawk."

38:54.123 --> 38:56.292
I mean, who works all night
at a radio station?

38:56.375 --> 38:59.378
And who is stupid enough to believe that?

38:59.462 --> 39:00.963
Apparently me, Vickie,

39:01.047 --> 39:03.549
who's sitting at home,
waiting for the phone to ring

39:03.632 --> 39:05.509
while you're off with your friends,
getting high.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.719
Getting high?

39:06.802 --> 39:10.348
Come on, Robin.
You are going through withdrawal.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.266
You have the wrong idea.
I am not on drugs.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.060
-Right, sorry.
-Just look at me!

39:14.143 --> 39:17.730
You have been busy with your friends
hunting monsters!

39:17.813 --> 39:20.191
God! All right,
maybe you even believe it yourself.

39:20.274 --> 39:23.736
With the amount that you were clearly on,
if you just go cold turkey,

39:23.819 --> 39:26.072
it can cause confusion,
paranoia, hallucinations…

39:26.155 --> 39:28.991
These are not hallucinations!

39:29.075 --> 39:30.785
Okay. So let's recap.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.995
-There is a dark wizard…
-Uh-huh.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.455
-…who is stealing children…
-Yep.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.999
-…and putting them in a dream world.
-Right.

39:38.459 --> 39:42.129
Vickie, the earth has split in four.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.757
The military has taken over our town.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.301
Is what I'm saying really so insane?

39:48.511 --> 39:49.804
Batshit!

39:49.887 --> 39:52.515
You wanna know
what my face is communicating right now?

39:52.598 --> 39:54.100
-Yes.
-Anger.

39:54.183 --> 39:59.355
But with a dash,
and it is a very, very reluctant dash,

39:59.438 --> 40:00.314
of worry.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.442
Because as furious
as I am with you right now,

40:03.526 --> 40:06.779
you are not well, Robin,
and you need help.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.739
You need serious help.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.076
-I got a call about some drugs…
-Hang on.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.202
Have you seen her?

40:13.285 --> 40:14.286
Robin Buckley?

40:14.370 --> 40:17.248
Yes, she's here. I just saw her go
into that room right there.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.626
Vickie, I'm so sorry.

40:20.709 --> 40:21.544
Don't.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.129
-But I gotta go.
-Robin!

40:23.838 --> 40:24.755
Hey!

40:25.923 --> 40:27.133
Hey, I'm talking to you!

40:27.800 --> 40:28.717
Buckley, stop!

40:32.638 --> 40:34.265
Where do you think you're going?

40:36.684 --> 40:39.019
Help!

40:39.103 --> 40:40.938
-Help!
-Dustin!

40:41.021 --> 40:42.690
-Help! Steve!
-Hey!

40:46.193 --> 40:47.278
Oh, thank you.

40:49.697 --> 40:53.826
Steve, what the hell are you doing?
That's never gonna work. Stop! Stop!

40:53.909 --> 40:57.121
Steve, stop. I'm serious. It's not safe.

40:57.204 --> 40:59.665
-You're gonna fall.
-It's unstable. I got it already, okay?

40:59.748 --> 41:02.334
No, don't! Stop being an asshole!

41:02.418 --> 41:04.128
I'm not. I'm trying to get to them!

41:04.211 --> 41:07.173
You always try to get yourself killed,
and I can't let it happen again.

41:07.256 --> 41:08.841
Stop being so selfish, please.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.802
If you go on there, you're gonna die,
and I can't deal with it again.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.221
You can't die
'cause I can't deal with it again.

41:14.305 --> 41:18.267
Don't let it happen again.
Please. Please don't let it happen again.

41:19.393 --> 41:20.394
Not you.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.605
I'm sorry.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.898
No, no, no.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.369
-Help!
-Help!

41:37.870 --> 41:39.997
-Come on! Help! Hey!
-Help!

41:40.831 --> 41:42.041
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:42.124 --> 41:43.626
Down. Get down. Get down.

41:45.252 --> 41:47.963
-What are we doing?
-Sitting spreads our weight out.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.924
Mr. Goldstein, physics.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.343
We can buy ourselves some time.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.471
They must have heard us by now.

41:55.554 --> 41:57.097
Then why haven't they called back?

41:57.181 --> 41:59.433
And even if they did,
what could they even do?

41:59.517 --> 42:01.393
Something. Anything.

42:01.477 --> 42:02.645
Yeah. Yeah.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.025
They're not coming.

42:08.108 --> 42:09.568
Don't say that.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.111
You wanted honesty.

42:31.298 --> 42:32.758
I hate The Clash.

42:34.927 --> 42:35.928
What?

42:38.389 --> 42:40.516
I hate The Clash.

42:40.599 --> 42:44.311
Every time you put them on,
I just try to disassociate from reality.

42:46.355 --> 42:47.439
Yep.

42:47.523 --> 42:48.983
I hate reading your articles.

42:49.066 --> 42:50.901
You don't actually wanna hear my thoughts.

42:50.985 --> 42:52.570
You just want me
to tell you they're great.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.029
Because they are.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.155
Most of the time.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.532
Most of the…

42:56.615 --> 42:58.117
Wow. Okay.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.662
I never read Slaughterhouse-Five.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.290
I just read the Cliff notes
and pretended I liked it.

43:04.373 --> 43:05.749
I never read Anna Karenina.

43:06.458 --> 43:08.294
I just read the Cliff notes
and pretended I liked it.

43:08.377 --> 43:10.879
You are always exactly six minutes late,

43:10.963 --> 43:15.009
and I never say anything,
but really, I wanna punch a wall.

43:15.092 --> 43:16.927
I took your pink sweater to Goodwill.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.762
What? I was looking for that.

43:18.846 --> 43:19.972
You know I hate pink.

43:20.055 --> 43:22.474
But I felt guilty afterwards
if that makes you feel better.

43:22.558 --> 43:26.145
I flushed the last bag of
Purple Palm Tree Delight down the toilet,

43:26.228 --> 43:27.896
and I didn't feel guilty about it after.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.149
-Come on.
-I hate it when you're high.

43:30.232 --> 43:31.358
I hate it when you're drunk.

43:31.442 --> 43:34.403
I hate it most of all
when you're high and I'm drunk.

43:34.486 --> 43:35.738
Me too.

43:36.572 --> 43:38.032
Why do we do that?

43:41.410 --> 43:42.494
No idea.

43:51.211 --> 43:52.963
I never applied to Emerson.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.008
I know.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.595
Why didn't you ever say anything?

44:00.846 --> 44:02.264
Why didn't you?

44:06.060 --> 44:07.144
I'm not sure.

44:12.983 --> 44:14.693
I just felt like I was…

44:16.570 --> 44:17.988
doing something wrong.

44:21.617 --> 44:24.787
Like I was going against
the natural order of things.

44:26.455 --> 44:27.665
You know, with…

44:29.124 --> 44:31.585
with what we've been through, it just…

44:31.669 --> 44:33.629
You mean our shared trauma?

44:35.422 --> 44:36.382
Yeah.

44:38.342 --> 44:42.429
How could anyone else possibly understand?

44:42.513 --> 44:43.806
It's like this…

44:44.890 --> 44:46.558
this thing that…

44:47.976 --> 44:50.145
ties us together forever.

44:51.021 --> 44:52.022
You know?

44:54.149 --> 44:56.151
It made me feel safe.

44:57.277 --> 44:58.487
But also…

45:00.864 --> 45:01.782
I don't know.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.159
It can be suffocating.

45:05.911 --> 45:06.912
Yeah.

45:10.916 --> 45:12.126
That spring break,

45:13.293 --> 45:15.087
when you were in Lenora…

45:16.672 --> 45:19.299
I didn't really have to stay behind
to work.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.969
I could have had Fred cover for me.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.682
But I think that's why I stayed.

45:28.183 --> 45:29.893
That feeling that I just…

45:30.728 --> 45:31.937
I needed space.

45:34.565 --> 45:36.442
Space to be with someone else?

45:41.989 --> 45:43.532
Steve's a good guy.

45:45.451 --> 45:46.744
He makes me laugh.

45:47.870 --> 45:52.458
And, he has better hair than you.
Like, way better.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.376
But no.

45:56.879 --> 45:59.173
No, it was never like that with him.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.633
We're just different people.

46:01.717 --> 46:05.429
You know what he told me?
He wants six kids.

46:05.512 --> 46:06.638
Six kids?

46:06.722 --> 46:08.891
Six little nuggets.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.101
That's like a Happy Meal.

46:12.686 --> 46:14.021
But my point is…

46:15.481 --> 46:18.942
he knows what he wants, and that's great.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.360
But I…

46:21.195 --> 46:22.196
don't.

46:23.989 --> 46:25.282
And…

46:25.949 --> 46:28.911
I guess I was hoping
I'd have time to figure that out.

46:30.162 --> 46:32.706
-But then…
-The world split in four.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.124
And now…

46:36.835 --> 46:37.961
And now…

46:42.549 --> 46:43.383
Hey…

46:48.764 --> 46:50.682
One last confession.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.101
A big one.

46:59.691 --> 47:01.235
John Coltrane.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.362
I figure that…

47:04.488 --> 47:06.156
I've screwed up enough with you.

47:08.450 --> 47:11.328
It'd be nice to get something right
for once in the end.

47:12.371 --> 47:13.372
Here.

47:31.348 --> 47:32.766
Nancy Wheeler.

47:35.310 --> 47:36.395
Will you…

47:38.272 --> 47:39.273
not…

47:40.107 --> 47:41.108
marry me?

47:48.115 --> 47:50.284
I tried to convince myself

47:51.451 --> 47:53.287
that this would somehow

47:54.079 --> 47:55.622
fix everything.

47:55.706 --> 47:58.333
But it was just gonna make things worse.

47:59.459 --> 48:02.921
Which is why it has been sitting
like a cannonball in my pocket

48:03.005 --> 48:04.506
for the last two days.

48:07.301 --> 48:08.552
So what do you say?

48:12.723 --> 48:14.766
Do you accept my un-proposal?

48:15.976 --> 48:17.936
I accept your un-proposal.

48:20.355 --> 48:21.481
I loved you.

48:22.816 --> 48:23.984
I love you,

48:24.818 --> 48:25.944
Nancy Wheeler.

48:27.446 --> 48:29.823
I love you, Jonathan Byers.

49:05.609 --> 49:06.777
Oh my God.

49:15.911 --> 49:16.954
Jonathan!

49:17.537 --> 49:18.538
Oh my God!

49:21.625 --> 49:22.626
My God.

49:49.653 --> 49:50.904
Thank you.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.572
I will find him.

49:54.074 --> 49:55.701
I will bring him home.

50:03.375 --> 50:06.211
Okay. Now remember,
if you want out of there…

50:35.574 --> 50:37.409
Will, I'm here.

50:39.327 --> 50:41.747
I need you to show me where you are.

50:43.373 --> 50:45.208
Show me where you are.

51:06.313 --> 51:07.314
Will.

51:10.609 --> 51:11.610
Will.

51:12.194 --> 51:13.403
Will, can you hear me?

51:13.487 --> 51:14.738
Will, wake up!

51:42.933 --> 51:44.059
Can I have that?

51:51.983 --> 51:53.568
Do you think someone fell?

51:58.031 --> 52:00.700
It… It's just a memory, right?

52:00.784 --> 52:02.661
Nothing in here can hurt us.

52:02.744 --> 52:04.079
Nothing can hurt us.

52:18.009 --> 52:19.302
Just stay behind me, okay?

52:19.386 --> 52:21.304
-But you said--
-I know what I said.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.776
How did you find me?

52:37.112 --> 52:39.114
How did you find me?

52:39.197 --> 52:42.117
He sees us. He sees us.
How does he see us?

52:42.200 --> 52:43.368
I won't hurt you.

52:44.035 --> 52:46.830
Please, mister, don't shoot.

52:46.913 --> 52:48.165
Who are you?

52:48.248 --> 52:50.834
Henry. Henry Creel. I live near here.

52:50.917 --> 52:52.961
-Who sent you?
-Nobody sent me.

52:53.044 --> 52:55.213
-They sent you.
-I was in the caves. I heard a scream.

52:55.297 --> 52:56.506
They sent you!

52:56.590 --> 52:59.676
You're just confused. You need a doctor.

53:13.773 --> 53:15.650
Please! Please!

53:24.159 --> 53:25.076
Holly!

53:26.077 --> 53:27.078
Holly!

53:31.416 --> 53:32.417
Shit!

53:34.336 --> 53:36.880
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

53:36.963 --> 53:41.343
Why did that man try to hurt Henry?
Hurt Henry? He was only trying to help.

53:41.426 --> 53:43.345
-I don't know.
-Is this what made Henry bad?

53:43.428 --> 53:47.140
I don't know. But it's over now, okay?
We have to keep moving.

54:37.482 --> 54:38.692
You were right.

54:38.775 --> 54:41.528
The way out of Camazotz, it's here.

54:42.988 --> 54:47.117
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill

54:50.453 --> 54:51.288
Max?

54:53.707 --> 54:59.379
…make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places

55:01.840 --> 55:08.555
You are going to spy for me one last time.

55:20.066 --> 55:21.067
Found you.

55:22.861 --> 55:26.489
Will. Will, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm here.

55:26.573 --> 55:27.574
-El…
-I'm here.

55:27.657 --> 55:28.825
El… El…

55:28.908 --> 55:32.412
It's me. It's me.
I'm here to bring you home. It's okay.

55:32.495 --> 55:35.623
I tried to stop him, but I couldn't.

55:35.707 --> 55:36.708
He saw.

55:37.292 --> 55:39.002
He saw what? What did he see?

55:39.711 --> 55:40.628
Max.

55:41.838 --> 55:43.381
He knows where she is now.

55:44.090 --> 55:45.842
And he sent them after her.

55:46.718 --> 55:49.387
They're coming for her. In Hawkins.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.476
-El!
-El, what's up?

55:54.559 --> 55:55.477
Are you okay?

55:56.227 --> 55:57.228
El, what's wrong?

55:57.312 --> 55:59.314
-Is he all right?
-Yeah.

55:59.397 --> 56:01.900
Vecna's going to kill Max.

56:02.484 --> 56:04.569
We have to get to the hospital right now.

56:04.652 --> 56:07.364
Hey! Are you deaf or what?
She's in withdrawal.

56:07.447 --> 56:08.865
-I am not.
-You know what that means?

56:08.948 --> 56:11.034
She needs to be in a hospital,
not a prison.

56:11.117 --> 56:13.161
Would you look at that?
She's in a hospital.

56:13.244 --> 56:16.164
This is Hawkins, Candy Cane.
Not our first junkie.

56:21.419 --> 56:23.338
Power outage in a hospital.

56:23.922 --> 56:26.216
Can't be good for Granny. Not our problem.

56:26.299 --> 56:27.884
You don't understand. We need to evacuate.

56:27.967 --> 56:30.678
We don't need to do shit.
Keep moving, junkie.

56:30.762 --> 56:32.138
I'm not a junkie.

56:32.222 --> 56:34.432
If we don't get everyone
out of here right now,

56:34.516 --> 56:36.476
we are all going to die.

56:36.559 --> 56:39.270
There is nothing you can say
on God's green earth

56:39.354 --> 56:42.982
that is going to keep you out of a cell.
So save your junkie breath.

56:43.066 --> 56:45.860
-We need to evacuate.
-I actually don't need to do shit.

56:48.446 --> 56:49.322
Holy shit!

56:49.406 --> 56:50.407
Run!

57:13.513 --> 57:15.056
They're not after us.

57:15.140 --> 57:16.099
Huh? What?

57:16.182 --> 57:19.185
They're not after us.
Do you know another way out?

57:19.269 --> 57:21.563
The basement. The basement!
It leads to staff parking.

57:23.690 --> 57:24.691
Okay.

57:25.233 --> 57:27.277
Come on, Lucas, pick up. Pick up.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.031
Pick up. Pick up. What are you doing?

57:32.115 --> 57:33.324
-Can those things understand English?
-No.

57:33.408 --> 57:34.993
-Then this doesn't need to be private.
-What?

57:36.411 --> 57:38.621
Lucas, it's Robin.
A Demo is headed your way.

57:38.705 --> 57:41.833
Do you hear me? A Demo is headed your way.
You need to get Max out of there now.

57:41.916 --> 57:43.835
Take the elevator.
They're on the stairwell.

57:43.918 --> 57:45.253
We'll meet you in the basement.

58:12.113 --> 58:13.156
Come on. Come on.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.292
Shit.

58:25.543 --> 58:26.503
Shit. Come on!

58:44.521 --> 58:46.022
Goddamnit!

58:47.732 --> 58:48.942
It's not budging.

58:49.025 --> 58:51.277
We're just gonna have to try, okay?

58:51.361 --> 58:52.362
Come on.

58:58.076 --> 58:59.077
You good?

58:59.160 --> 59:00.537
-I… I'm good.
-Okay.

59:04.249 --> 59:06.918
-I need you to grab my hand, okay?
-Okay.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.276
Whoa! Jesus!

59:31.359 --> 59:32.819
Okay. They're coming!

59:32.902 --> 59:34.279
-We gotta go!
-Which way?

59:35.738 --> 59:38.116
Here! What the hell is going on?

59:39.409 --> 59:41.035
-Here!
-How are they finding us?

59:41.119 --> 59:42.829
I don't know,
but we gotta get out of here.

59:42.912 --> 59:43.788
Okay. Come on.

59:43.871 --> 59:45.707
-Come on. Let's go.
-Go, go, go.

59:45.790 --> 59:48.209
Come on. Shut the door. Shut the door!

59:50.670 --> 59:52.714
-Oh, shit.
-Go! Just keep going!

59:53.673 --> 59:54.966
-Come on.
-Damn it!

59:55.049 --> 59:56.634
We gotta go!

59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.221
-The door! Open the door!
-Go, go, go!

01:00:05.393 --> 01:00:07.729
Shit. This way, guys! Come on! Come on!

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:08.771
Get down!

01:00:15.528 --> 01:00:17.989
If I only could…

01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:20.783
I'm really sorry
I thought you were a druggie.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:26.623
I'm sorry for lying to you for, like,
a ludicrously extended period of time.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:30.710
For the record,
I wasn't lying about Enzo's.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:35.548
And if by some miracle we survive this,
I am going to take you there,

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:39.552
and we are getting dessert. Deal?

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.722
Unaware I'm tearin' you asunder
Yeah, yeah, yo

01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:45.850
There is thunder in our hearts

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.203
It's you and me

01:01:05.286 --> 01:01:06.704
We have to turn it off.

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:10.291
We can't. We can't.
No. No. Max is coming back.

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:12.043
We have to.

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:14.337
She's coming back.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.422
Come on, darlin'

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.470
Are you okay?

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:24.972
Go.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:36.734
Okay.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.407
You ready to go home, tourist?

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:46.035
Yeah.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:50.331
If I only could make a deal with God

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:53.543
I'd get him to swap our places

01:01:54.752 --> 01:01:58.506
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:07.974
If I only could make a deal with God

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:11.310
I'd get him to swap our places

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:15.773
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.859
Be runnin' up that building

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:15.560
Let's exchange the experience

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.737
Lucas.

01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:34.996
Holly. Wait.

01:04:37.331 --> 01:04:38.374
You can't come with me.

01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:41.252
What? What do you mean?

01:04:41.335 --> 01:04:42.712
This way leads to me,

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:46.340
to my body, not yours.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.050
You have to find your own way.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:51.679
How? I don't have Kate Bush.
I don't even know who Kate Bush is.

01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:53.681
You don't need Kate Bush
to get out of here.

01:04:53.764 --> 01:04:55.766
Turns out, I don't either.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.144
Music isn't the only way back.

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:03.149
You just need something that connects you
to the real world, to home.

01:05:03.816 --> 01:05:05.651
Something powerful,

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.486
meaningful.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:11.198
Lucas, when… when he took my hand
in the hospital,

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.785
I could feel it. Right here.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.581
But then I could also feel it in here.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:20.875
But I don't have a boyfriend.

01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:22.293
You don't need a boyfriend.

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:24.420
You just need something
that's special to you,

01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:27.548
something that makes you feel safe,

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:31.677
something that brings you strength,
something that gives you hope.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:33.471
Holly the Heroic.

01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:35.306
She's here with you now.

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.768
But she's also with you in the real world.

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:42.772
Wherever you are,
all you have to do is follow her home.

01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:43.940
How?

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:49.612
Just… try and remember
what it is that she means to you.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.865
She doesn't mean anything important.

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:56.369
She's just a toy.

01:05:57.453 --> 01:06:00.331
If she's just a toy,
why do you always carry her with you?

01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:01.874
Mike.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:05.586
He said that she had divine powers
and that she never gets scared,

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:09.632
and so if I ever got scared,
I could just… become her.

01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:13.219
But I keep trying, and it never works.

01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:17.348
No matter what I do, I'm still me.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.186
The girl who needs a stupid night-light.

01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:25.314
When my mom was attacked,
I couldn't save her.

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:26.691
I couldn't even save myself.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.359
Holly, get back!

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:31.529
I just stood there.

01:06:31.612 --> 01:06:33.531
And then when Henry attacked you…

01:06:34.198 --> 01:06:35.825
Stop!

01:06:35.908 --> 01:06:40.746
I stood there again.
There's nothing heroic about that.

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:44.208
There was nothing that you could do
in those moments, Holly.

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:47.378
I mean, you're a Wheeler. You're smart.

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:51.716
You honestly think that you could've
stopped those monsters with a fire poker?

01:06:52.299 --> 01:06:55.094
And I think you're leaving
a few important things out.

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.888
The day that we met,
you went into the woods

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:00.558
even though Henry told you
that dangerous monsters live there.

01:07:00.641 --> 01:07:03.019
And then you followed me into the cave

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:05.688
even though you had no good reason
to trust me.

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:08.941
And then when I told you
to go back to Henry,

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.484
to go back into danger,

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:11.861
you didn't hesitate.

01:07:11.944 --> 01:07:15.823
And today, when I gave up, you didn't.

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:19.535
I've been here for so long, Holly.

01:07:20.911 --> 01:07:21.996
So long.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.875
And I could never make it out.

01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:29.253
But you?

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.381
You found a way through Camazotz.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:33.716
Because of you…

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:36.635
I get to see my friends.

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.221
I get to see Lucas.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.476
You saved me, Holly Wheeler.

01:07:44.977 --> 01:07:46.062
You saved me.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:52.610
So you see,
Holly the Heroic is not just a toy.

01:07:54.528 --> 01:07:56.030
She's you, Holly.

01:07:57.698 --> 01:07:58.699
She's you.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.513
How did you know that would work?

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.724
I didn't.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:30.523
You still have a long journey ahead.
I don't know where you're gonna wake up.

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:32.691
But I figure Vecna's holding you
in the Upside Down.

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:36.946
But remember, the Upside Down,
it's just like Hawkins.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.949
So find your way back to your house
and hide there.

01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:42.284
We will come and find you. Okay?

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:00.219
I'll see you on the other side.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:02.012
On the other side.

01:09:27.288 --> 01:09:31.292
If I only could make a deal with God

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:35.171
I'd get him to swap our places

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:40.009
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:43.804
With no problems

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:48.142
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:52.229
With no problems
