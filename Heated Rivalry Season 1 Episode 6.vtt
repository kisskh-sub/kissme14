WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:02.544
- <i>Previously, on</i>
Heated Rivalry...

00:02.669 --> 00:05.130
- <i>Can I ask if you've ever
been with another guy?</i>

00:06.881 --> 00:08.007
It's really OK.

00:08.133 --> 00:09.718
<i>Let's be best friends.</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:11.678
- You and her are not...

00:11.803 --> 00:12.887
- We're not.

00:13.012 --> 00:14.388
- You're playing
on the same team

00:14.389 --> 00:16.015
as Hollander this year, right?

00:16.141 --> 00:17.350
(Crowd cheering)

00:18.560 --> 00:20.310
- <i>I don't think
I can keep pretending</i>

00:20.311 --> 00:22.564
<i>I don't like you anymore.</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:24.441
<i>You know I love you.</i>

00:24.566 --> 00:25.567
I know you do.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.610
But it's not the same
as it is with Jane.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.614
- <i>You scared me.</i>

00:32.615 --> 00:36.285
- I was gonna ask you, will you
come to my cottage this summer?

00:36.286 --> 00:37.579
- You know we can't do that.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.206
(Crowd cheering)

00:43.335 --> 00:44.836
(Crowd cheering loudly)

00:46.504 --> 00:48.465
- I'm coming to the cottage.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.724
(Crowd applauding)

00:59.100 --> 01:03.479
- (Woman): <i>And the most valuable
player is Scott Hunter.</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:06.816
(Crowd cheering and applauding)

01:09.736 --> 01:10.820
- <i>Thank you.</i>

01:15.825 --> 01:17.201
(Sighing)

01:17.202 --> 01:19.454
(Crowd continues applauding)

01:19.579 --> 01:21.206
Um...

01:22.874 --> 01:27.837
A few weeks ago,
I achieved my lifelong dream.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.173
Winning the Cup.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.673
(Crowd cheering)

01:31.674 --> 01:34.677
Those of you who've done that
know how it feels.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.682
I don't even think I have
the words to describe it.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.769
But something else
happened that night.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.273
Something you may have noticed
got a lot more attention

01:47.399 --> 01:49.400
than the Admirals
winning the Cup.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.026
(Crowd applauding)

01:51.027 --> 01:51.945
(Chuckling)

01:53.321 --> 01:56.324
It's, uh, it's been
an interesting month.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.283
(Clears throat)

01:57.409 --> 01:58.952
(Crowd laughing)

01:59.077 --> 02:00.828
In case you missed it somehow,

02:00.829 --> 02:04.874
I came out as gay
in a ridiculously public way.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.585
And I've always been
a private person.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.715
I've never really shared
anything about my private life.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.801
But from what I've seen
over the past few weeks,

02:15.802 --> 02:18.471
it's--it's maybe
important that I do a bit.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.600
Fans have been
sending me messages...

02:23.476 --> 02:25.602
and a lot of young fans,

02:25.603 --> 02:29.441
telling me how much it meant
to them for me to come out.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.986
And look, I love hockey.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.282
I'm so grateful that I get
to do this for a living.

02:38.616 --> 02:42.078
But I also know what
it feels like to not fit in.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.334
When I was a teenager, I...

02:49.294 --> 02:51.837
I realized that
I may be that thing

02:51.838 --> 02:55.342
that hockey players like
to throw around as an insult.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.677
The kind of language
that I heard

02:57.802 --> 02:59.887
on the ice and in
the locker room every day

02:59.888 --> 03:02.640
was a constant reminder
that I was different.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.809
Wh-when you have a secret

03:05.810 --> 03:09.522
that you work as hard as I did
to protect, it's, um...

03:11.149 --> 03:12.442
It's exhausting.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.487
It's a nonstop effort.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.948
And it's also really, really...

03:19.991 --> 03:21.618
lonely.

03:23.244 --> 03:28.041
<i>Thankfully, I found the person
who changes everything.</i>

03:29.417 --> 03:32.503
<i>And he gave me the confidence
and strength</i>

03:32.504 --> 03:35.799
<i>and the need to be honest
about who I am.</i>

03:39.177 --> 03:41.471
Fear is a powerful thing.

03:43.223 --> 03:47.060
But this year, I found the one
thing that is more powerful.

03:48.645 --> 03:52.148
So I share this honor with
my teammates and my coaches.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.694
But I also share it
with you, Kip.

03:57.070 --> 04:02.075
<i>You have made me better
in every conceivable way.</i>

04:03.201 --> 04:04.536
<i>I love you.</i>

04:05.912 --> 04:07.413
<i>Thank you!</i>

04:07.414 --> 04:09.582
(Crowd cheering and applauding)

04:35.483 --> 04:36.818
(Sighing)

04:36.943 --> 04:38.652
- Is this a Jeep?

04:38.653 --> 04:40.113
- No, it's British.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.489
Practical.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.325
Good in the snow.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.785
- OK.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.174
(Bird calling)

04:59.299 --> 05:02.427
(<i>♪ L'anarchie des jours heureux</i>
by La Bronze ♪)

05:19.194 --> 05:20.444
- Are you hungry?

05:20.445 --> 05:21.863
It's about a two hour drive,

05:21.988 --> 05:24.157
but we can stop
for something if you want.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.658
- No, I'm OK.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.372
- I think you're gonna
like the cottage.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.832
It's, uh, relaxing.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.877
- Ah, is that what
we are going to do?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.587
Relax?

05:38.421 --> 05:39.798
- I hope so.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.510
I would like to relax with you.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.762
For once.

05:48.973 --> 05:53.268
I bought groceries,
so we don't need to leave.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.979
Or not leave much.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.272
If we don't want to.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.650
- Thank you for inviting me.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.490
- I'm glad you're here.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.618
- Me too, but...

06:09.494 --> 06:11.871
also, like, terrified, yeah?

06:11.997 --> 06:13.206
(Chuckling)

06:22.507 --> 06:24.591
- Did anyone recognize you?

06:24.592 --> 06:26.219
At the airport or anything?

06:26.344 --> 06:28.303
- No, no. Not that I noticed.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.723
- Cool.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.435
The cottage is super private,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.728
so we don't need to worry
about anything.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.772
- Not even your parents?
- No.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.649
I told them I was
on a silent retreat,

06:40.650 --> 06:41.901
like a meditation thing.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.152
(Laughing)

06:43.153 --> 06:45.113
What? Does that sound fake?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.823
- Yes!

06:46.948 --> 06:48.490
Ah!

06:48.491 --> 06:50.617
It would if it was
anyone but you.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.829
(Both laughing)

07:06.593 --> 07:08.345
(Birds chirping)

07:09.429 --> 07:11.347
I can carry my own bag.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.765
- How are your ribs?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.851
- Fine, I can take my bag.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.562
- I can't believe you played
with those bruised ribs.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.397
- Whoa, you can't?

07:20.398 --> 07:22.275
- OK, maybe I can.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.955
Wow!

07:36.998 --> 07:39.668
Your real estate fetish
really paid off, huh?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.252
(Door closing)

07:42.754 --> 07:45.256
- I didn't buy this.
I had it built.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.801
- Oh, I know.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.142
- I can give you a tour,
if you'd like,

07:56.267 --> 07:58.143
or I could make us some lunch.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.646
There's plenty of food.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.897
Also, I bought you Cokes,

08:01.898 --> 08:04.234
though the water here
is really good.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.195
I have my own well.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.738
You can see it.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.158
In case you're thirsty.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.227
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:40.228 --> 08:41.771
(Laughing)

08:54.075 --> 08:57.871
- Wait, um, it's been a while,
so I might not last long.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.207
- Yes, same,
but we have two weeks.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.708
- Yeah, cool.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.295
W-wait, same?

09:06.379 --> 09:07.671
- Mmm.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.256
- You said "same."

09:09.257 --> 09:12.092
You haven't been
with anyone lately?

09:12.093 --> 09:13.303
- No.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.929
- Not since...

09:15.930 --> 09:17.681
- No, not since, so can we...

09:17.682 --> 09:19.184
- Really?

09:20.351 --> 09:21.436
Really?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.230
- Hollander, it's not
a big deal, OK?

09:24.356 --> 09:25.899
- Yeah, but it's been...

09:26.024 --> 09:27.441
- Months, yes, I know.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.235
So can we fuck now, please?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.654
- I haven't either.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.824
Not since the last time.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.505
I have an idea.

09:49.506 --> 09:50.672
(Sighing)

09:50.673 --> 09:52.926
(Chuckling)

09:53.802 --> 09:55.595
- What?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.931
- For the next two weeks,

09:58.056 --> 10:00.350
let's just be honest
with each other...

10:01.309 --> 10:04.854
about what we
actually think and...

10:05.772 --> 10:07.440
maybe how we really feel?

10:11.152 --> 10:12.695
- I will try.

10:12.696 --> 10:13.989
- Really?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.239
- Yes.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.324
I will do anything

10:16.449 --> 10:18.785
if it will make you touch
my dick right now.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.244
(Chuckling)

10:20.245 --> 10:22.789
- Should I show you
to your room?

10:23.748 --> 10:25.625
There's two
guest rooms downstairs,

10:25.750 --> 10:27.001
so plenty to choose from.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.503
- Mmm. I will need
a king-size bed.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.172
They all have a king-size bed.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.507
- And a view.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.758
- They all have a view.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.843
- Hmm. And I will need a...

10:35.844 --> 10:36.803
What do you call it?

10:36.928 --> 10:38.471
An en-suite bedroom.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.597
- Well, that might be a problem.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.849
- Oh, why is that?

10:41.850 --> 10:43.851
- There's only one
with an en-suite.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.395
And it's mine.
- Ah...

10:54.779 --> 10:56.322
This is awkward.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.074
This room isn't available
to the guests.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.036
- Mmm. Disappointing.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.456
- I'm sorry, sir. We'd really
like to accommodate you, but...

11:05.749 --> 11:06.915
Sir, I'm just a bellboy!

11:06.916 --> 11:08.667
You can't treat
the staff like this.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.545
- Oh, I think I know how the
staff likes to be treated

11:11.546 --> 11:13.089
after all these years, hmm?

11:16.885 --> 11:18.635
(Moaning)

11:18.636 --> 11:19.888
- Wait.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.514
Wait, wait, wait.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.484
- Uh, no.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.280
Ah.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.452
(Chuckling)

12:12.440 --> 12:14.109
(Whistling)

12:15.068 --> 12:17.237
Why are you making
so many burgers?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.406
- The recipe was
for eight, so...

12:20.573 --> 12:22.075
- OK, you cut it in half.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.868
What, you can't do math?

12:23.994 --> 12:25.537
- Leave me alone.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.540
- No.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.552
- OK, fine. I should have
cut it in half.

12:42.387 --> 12:45.013
Ordinarily, I would give
the rest to my parents,

12:45.014 --> 12:46.306
but that would probably ruin

12:46.307 --> 12:48.435
my whole silent retreat lie,
I guess.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.894
- Yuna and David, yes?

12:50.729 --> 12:51.896
- Mm-hmm.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.067
- And?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.154
- And what?

13:00.071 --> 13:01.655
- Tell me about them.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.491
- What do you want to know?

13:05.493 --> 13:08.454
- I don't know.
I don't know anything.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.999
I know your mother
is Japanese or something.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.878
Probably where you
get your looks.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.754
- Half of them, yeah.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.299
- And your dad is, what, boring?

13:19.424 --> 13:21.550
Is that where you
get your boring from?

13:21.551 --> 13:23.218
- He's not boring.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.597
- So, he's exciting,
reading the <i>New Yorker?</i>

13:26.598 --> 13:28.974
- He's normal, OK?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.310
He works for the
Treasury Board of Canada.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.562
- Hmm. Crazy!

13:32.687 --> 13:33.687
- Fuck you!

13:33.688 --> 13:34.773
He played hockey for McGill.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.317
- Whoa. McGill?

13:37.442 --> 13:38.485
(Laughing)

13:38.610 --> 13:39.778
What the fuck is McGill?

13:39.903 --> 13:41.028
Is McGill a town?

13:41.029 --> 13:42.655
- It's a really good school.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.949
My parents are great.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.327
- Do they know?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.329
- About you?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.538
Of course not.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.375
- No, about you.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.876
- No.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.213
- Would they not be
good about it?

14:01.007 --> 14:02.591
- I don't know.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.135
I mean, no, they'd be fine.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.222
I'm sure they would be, but...

14:08.181 --> 14:11.017
I don't know.
We haven't talked about it.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.315
Sometimes, I think I would have
told them already.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.741
- Oh, this is my fault.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.827
- No.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.205
Well, I mean, yeah, kind of.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.250
(Sighing)

14:36.292 --> 14:37.459
- Look...

14:37.460 --> 14:39.462
I think you can tell
your parents you're gay

14:39.587 --> 14:42.006
without giving them a list
of all the guys you're fucking.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.508
- I know, I know.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.469
Anyways, it just
doesn't really matter.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.014
You done?

14:53.935 --> 14:55.437
(Sniffling)

14:58.148 --> 15:00.442
(Insects chirring)

15:01.901 --> 15:03.528
- Nice, right?

15:05.447 --> 15:07.699
- So we just sit here
and look at it?

15:07.824 --> 15:09.033
- Yes.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.369
We just sit here and look at it.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.247
- Canada is fun.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.540
- Shut up!

15:15.665 --> 15:17.375
(Phone vibrating)

15:19.794 --> 15:20.795
(Chuckling)

15:22.505 --> 15:24.131
It was just Rose.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.592
- Mmm. Just Rose?

15:26.593 --> 15:28.720
She's just checking in.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.432
You're not jealous, are you?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.476
- No.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.227
- Ilya, I'm gay.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.397
- Yeah, not so gay you
can't fuck Rose Landry.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.191
- Oh my God.
It was, like, twice.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.319
And both times
were complete disasters.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.154
I'm not sure she's looking
for a repeat performance.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.864
- Oh, disasters like how?

15:48.865 --> 15:50.617
- I'm not going into details.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.161
(Loon calling in distance)

15:53.286 --> 15:54.995
- What the fuck was that?

15:54.996 --> 15:56.247
- A loon?

15:57.082 --> 15:58.624
- A what?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.250
- A loon. It's a bird.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.878
- Sounds like a fucking wolf.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.462
- It's a bird, trust me.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.505
(Loon calling)

16:04.506 --> 16:05.589
You're so scared.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.175
- What kind of a bird
makes a noise like that?

16:08.176 --> 16:10.719
- A loon! A fucking wolf?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.930
- Stupid Canadian wolf bird.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.599
(Laughing)

16:17.769 --> 16:19.312
(Imitating loon call)

16:20.814 --> 16:23.023
Oh, so now you speak bird, too.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.526
- Fluent.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.860
- I hate you.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.530
- No, you don't.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.208
Have you talked to
your brother lately?

16:41.543 --> 16:42.794
- Mm-mmm.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.214
- Is that a good thing?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.635
- Probably, I don't know.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.515
- I'm sorry about your family.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.393
Even if they suck,
you must miss them.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.522
- My mother didn't suck.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.317
She was great.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.696
How did she die?

17:11.740 --> 17:13.533
- By accident.

17:15.744 --> 17:19.539
She accidentally swallowed
a whole bottle of pills.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.877
- How old were you?

17:27.130 --> 17:28.673
- 12.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.594
I found her.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.937
I don't want you
to think she was weak.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.607
- I don't.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.359
- She wasn't.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.905
She was so funny and beautiful.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.368
She was so sad.

17:58.370 --> 18:00.914
And my dad was so hard on her.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.123
And...

18:03.124 --> 18:04.583
(Loon calling)

18:04.584 --> 18:06.043
Motherfucker!

18:06.044 --> 18:08.463
(Laughing)

18:17.430 --> 18:19.391
- Do you wanna go inside?

18:20.975 --> 18:22.644
- No.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.658
(Birds chirping)

18:42.664 --> 18:43.915
- Good morning.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.584
- Good morning.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.463
I like you.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.675
- I like you too.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.026
(♪ Rock on TV ♪)

19:12.027 --> 19:13.194
- You can't pick Montreal.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.737
- Yes, I can.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.114
I've always wondered what it
would be like to be a Metro.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.742
You know, historically,
they're the best team in sport.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.201
- Better than
the fucking Yankees.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.244
- Oh, I know so.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.662
- Well, I'm gonna be Boston.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.831
- Good choice.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.666
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.459
- I am you.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.336
- Well, you're not anything.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.255
- I'm on the cover
of the fucking game.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.132
(Laughing)

19:34.257 --> 19:35.717
(Phone vibrating)

19:36.968 --> 19:38.553
- Oh, fuck. It's Hayden.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.930
He just had a baby. I haven't
talked to him in weeks.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.223
(Groaning)

19:43.224 --> 19:44.851
You're a baby.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.560
Hey, buddy.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.938
Yeah, uh, how's...

19:49.064 --> 19:50.564
I know, I'm so sorry.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.108
But how's Amber, right?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.568
How is she?

19:56.237 --> 19:58.323
Oh, yeah, the pics are cute.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.910
Oh, good, good.
And Jacki's good too?

20:03.328 --> 20:05.872
Is it better than, um...

20:07.457 --> 20:09.376
Yeah, no, I--I remember that.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.752
That was a tough time.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.339
Uh, sorry, hey, just, um,
my mom's on the other line.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.175
I'm just gonna get
rid of her, OK?

20:17.300 --> 20:18.467
(Phone beeping)

20:18.468 --> 20:19.719
What are you doing?

20:19.844 --> 20:21.096
- I think you know.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.430
- Please stop.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.725
- I don't think
it's what you want.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.519
- Later, OK?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.604
- OK, I make you a deal.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.981
I won't touch you,
but if you get hard...

20:32.982 --> 20:33.942
- I won't get hard.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.860
- OK, so no problem then.

20:35.986 --> 20:37.445
- Ilya...

20:38.363 --> 20:40.115
- Shane...

20:41.908 --> 20:43.117
(Phone beeping)

20:43.118 --> 20:46.955
- Uh, sorry, man, yeah,
my mom is so annoying sometimes.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.040
Sorry, you were saying?

20:49.165 --> 20:51.333
Oh, right, yeah, yeah, Mark.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.795
And that's her middle brother?

20:55.213 --> 20:57.465
Brother-in-law, right.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.176
But he's the one...

21:00.301 --> 21:03.054
Got it, right, yeah,
from Thanksgiving.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.978
Yeah, yeah, he's--he's great.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.397
Uh...

21:13.315 --> 21:15.984
Well, that's nice
he could come and stay.

21:19.946 --> 21:20.864
(Moaning softly)

21:20.989 --> 21:23.575
Cool, cool, yeah, yeah,
that makes sense.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.162
Uh, no, nothing much here.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.081
The headaches are better.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.499
Fuck.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.335
No, sorry, just a text.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.837
Totally.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.841
Yeah, it's totally clear,
so all's well there.

21:40.842 --> 21:42.509
Ah, jeez.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.763
Sorry, hey, one second.

21:44.888 --> 21:45.805
(Phone beeping)

21:45.930 --> 21:48.141
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck!

21:49.267 --> 21:51.853
(Moaning)

22:02.572 --> 22:03.573
(Phone beeping)

22:03.698 --> 22:06.326
Ah. Sorry, man,
I just... I have to run.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.951
Someone's at the door.

22:07.952 --> 22:08.952
(Laughing)

22:08.953 --> 22:09.746
Fuck...

22:09.871 --> 22:12.248
No, it's just...
It's just Amazon.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.793
But, um, I'll call you
next week, and...

22:14.918 --> 22:19.464
Yeah, yeah, so, totally.
And, uh...

22:20.423 --> 22:22.299
All right, yes, love you, man.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.678
And give my best
to Jacki and the kids.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.889
Fuck you, fuck you.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.099
(Both laughing)

22:30.100 --> 22:31.184
Why was that so hot?

22:31.309 --> 22:33.812
- Because you like to be bad.

22:37.691 --> 22:40.986
- Hey, that's not what this is.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.488
You and me.

22:44.698 --> 22:47.491
Maybe it was at first,

22:47.492 --> 22:50.662
but not now
and not for a long time.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.082
- So, you love Hayden?

22:55.083 --> 22:56.251
- All right...

22:59.212 --> 23:00.880
(Birds chirping)

23:03.008 --> 23:06.761
- So I was thinking I'm
a free agent next season.

23:07.679 --> 23:09.471
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.766
- You wouldn't
re-sign with Boston?

23:13.351 --> 23:15.019
(Both breathing heavily)

23:16.521 --> 23:17.480
(Laughing)

23:17.605 --> 23:19.273
Then where?

23:19.274 --> 23:22.527
- I don't know, I was thinking
maybe a Canadian team.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.740
Not Montreal, huh?

23:27.741 --> 23:29.658
- No, I mean, I know.

23:29.659 --> 23:32.954
- But I would love to not
have Russian passport.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.133
(Insects chirring)

23:50.263 --> 23:52.223
I could marry Svetlana.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.227
She's American.
Would be easy citizenship.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.230
She would do it.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.608
Her father is goalie
Sergei Vitrov.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.568
- Yeah, you've told me.

24:04.569 --> 24:06.738
- She would help me.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.743
- But...

24:12.827 --> 24:15.496
is she, I don't know,
someone you'd want to marry?

24:15.497 --> 24:16.622
- We are friends.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.083
We would be fine.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.753
And it would be
for the passport.

24:24.089 --> 24:26.257
- OK, but...

24:27.467 --> 24:28.843
- But what?

24:30.929 --> 24:33.973
- But you like women, right?

24:35.183 --> 24:39.520
You could find someone
you'd want to marry for real

24:39.521 --> 24:41.940
and still get the passport.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.275
- Maybe, but...

24:45.276 --> 24:46.486
(Sighing)

24:46.611 --> 24:48.113
- But what?

24:49.280 --> 24:50.949
- I have this problem.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.202
- What's the problem?

24:57.414 --> 24:59.457
- I like women, yes?

24:59.582 --> 25:00.750
- Yeah, I know.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.126
- And everywhere I go,

25:02.127 --> 25:04.211
I'm surrounded
by beautiful women.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.546
And they love me.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.047
- Sounds rough.

25:07.048 --> 25:08.424
- Yes, it is.

25:08.425 --> 25:10.092
Listen.

25:10.093 --> 25:15.056
And these women,
they're so sexy and fun.

25:16.599 --> 25:21.563
But I am always thinking about
this slow fucking hockey player

25:21.688 --> 25:24.065
with beautiful freckles.

25:26.276 --> 25:28.235
And a weak backhand.

25:28.236 --> 25:29.528
- A weak backhand?

25:29.529 --> 25:30.739
- Yes, very weak.

25:30.864 --> 25:33.657
And he's so boring,
and he drives this terrible car.

25:33.658 --> 25:35.660
- It's a normal car!

25:36.745 --> 25:39.372
- I am always wishing that
these women were him.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.835
It's a terrible problem, huh?

25:49.591 --> 25:52.177
- Do you want that problem
to go away?

25:53.678 --> 25:55.929
- Mm-mmm.

25:55.930 --> 25:59.768
I don't ever want that problem
to ever go away.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.400
- Don't marry Svetlana.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.944
Just don't.

26:11.946 --> 26:15.033
I know it wouldn't be
for love or whatever.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.786
Just don't.

26:19.954 --> 26:22.791
We can figure
something else out, OK?

26:25.001 --> 26:26.378
- OK.

26:33.385 --> 26:35.428
(Insects chirring)

26:38.556 --> 26:40.100
(Sighing)

26:54.489 --> 26:56.282
Mmm.

26:56.408 --> 26:58.451
- I have another idea.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.787
- What idea? What is happening?

27:03.581 --> 27:05.666
- What if you played in Ottawa?

27:05.667 --> 27:08.210
- Ottawa is the same
division as Boston.

27:08.211 --> 27:09.294
We're still rivals.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.796
- OK, but listen.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.090
First off, super close by.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.134
Second, Ottawa needs
a star center,

27:15.135 --> 27:17.052
and they're nowhere near
their cap,

27:17.053 --> 27:19.054
so they could definitely
afford you.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.598
And maybe we could start to
change the narrative a bit.

27:21.599 --> 27:22.808
- What?

27:22.809 --> 27:24.768
Hollander, I just woke up.

27:24.769 --> 27:26.146
What is narrative?

27:26.271 --> 27:28.439
- Boston and Montreal.
That's intense.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.566
Everyone knows that.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.151
But Montreal and Ottawa?

27:32.318 --> 27:34.946
And look, lots of guys have
friends on other teams.

27:35.071 --> 27:36.488
We're not rookies anymore.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.491
There are younger guys coming in
frothing at the mouth.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.076
Let them hate each other.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.537
We don't need to keep this up
until we retire, do we?

27:43.538 --> 27:44.788
We're not fucking wrestlers.

27:44.789 --> 27:47.333
- Hollander, Hollander,
OK, it's very late.

27:47.334 --> 27:48.710
And this is so many words.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.336
What are you getting at?

27:50.462 --> 27:52.338
- You play for Ottawa.

27:52.464 --> 27:54.382
I play for Montreal.

27:55.550 --> 27:59.470
OK? We're only two hours apart,
and we start a charity.

27:59.471 --> 28:02.890
Something that, you know,
we both care about.

28:02.891 --> 28:05.727
And we come up with a story,
like I approached you.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.227
- Or I approached you.

28:07.228 --> 28:08.729
- Fine, sure.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.690
And we tell
the press and everyone

28:10.815 --> 28:13.942
that by working on this cause
that we both love,

28:13.943 --> 28:17.322
that we developed a mutual
respect for one another and,

28:17.447 --> 28:19.157
um...

28:21.076 --> 28:23.369
- And we like sucking
each other's dicks.

28:23.370 --> 28:24.287
Any questions?

28:24.412 --> 28:25.454
- Fuck off.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.374
This is a good idea, Rozanov.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.752
- OK, OK!

28:30.877 --> 28:32.378
It's not bad.

28:32.379 --> 28:33.504
So we start the charity.

28:33.505 --> 28:35.756
- Yeah, and it wouldn't
be bullshit either.

28:35.757 --> 28:38.092
Like, we can really
start a charity.

28:38.093 --> 28:40.762
Something cool that means
a lot to both of us.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.639
And, you know,
we still play hard

28:43.640 --> 28:45.392
against each other on the ice.

28:45.517 --> 28:46.600
(Chuckling)

28:46.601 --> 28:48.019
Shut up!

28:49.396 --> 28:53.023
And then if people saw us
out in public or whatever,

28:53.024 --> 28:55.944
it wouldn't be so fucking crazy.

28:57.362 --> 29:01.032
And we're only two hours
apart all year round.

29:01.991 --> 29:05.286
Apply for, like,
citizenship here in Canada.

29:06.287 --> 29:10.375
And maybe one day
when we both retire...

29:11.710 --> 29:13.627
we could be together.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.296
For real.

29:20.135 --> 29:23.054
- You really think
that far ahead, Hollander?

29:25.306 --> 29:26.307
- I do.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.561
About this.

29:32.689 --> 29:34.982
- And is that what you want?

29:34.983 --> 29:36.901
To be together?

29:39.195 --> 29:40.405
- So much.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.450
So much it scares me.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.461
Hey...

30:00.425 --> 30:02.427
(Whispering, indistinct)

30:10.810 --> 30:13.021
- I love you.

30:14.522 --> 30:16.316
- Holy shit.

30:18.652 --> 30:20.027
- I mean...

30:20.028 --> 30:21.946
- I love you too.

30:25.909 --> 30:27.993
- Fuck, Hollander.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.997
- Oh my God,
I love you so much.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.759
Does it...

30:43.760 --> 30:46.554
Does it fucking kill you too?

30:49.849 --> 30:51.518
- Not anymore.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.576
(Birds chirping)

32:07.177 --> 32:09.220
- How did we let this happen?

32:10.472 --> 32:14.309
- We were both very stupid
and irresponsible.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.479
- This is real though, right?

32:18.480 --> 32:20.315
- Yeah.

32:23.777 --> 32:25.445
- Please fuck me.

32:28.490 --> 32:29.741
(Both moaning)

33:06.403 --> 33:08.697
What was your mother's name?

33:11.658 --> 33:13.118
- Irina.

33:13.868 --> 33:15.286
Why?

33:20.959 --> 33:25.212
- I was thinking we could
start a hockey school.

33:25.213 --> 33:27.214
Like a summer camp for kids.

33:27.215 --> 33:31.720
And give the money away to
mental health organizations.

33:32.846 --> 33:35.140
Like suicide prevention.

33:37.475 --> 33:39.352
It was just an idea.

33:44.232 --> 33:46.359
- She would have loved you.

33:49.863 --> 33:51.656
Like I love you.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.414
Say it again in Russian, please.

34:03.293 --> 34:07.756
(Speaking Russian)

34:19.225 --> 34:21.770
(Duck quacking)

34:26.024 --> 34:27.442
- Whoo!

34:29.194 --> 34:31.905
Is this where you do yoga,
or up there?

34:32.030 --> 34:33.113
- No, I do it inside.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.200
The producer wanted me...

34:36.159 --> 34:37.618
Wait, you saw that?

34:37.619 --> 34:39.370
- Yeah, it was very good.

34:39.371 --> 34:41.663
I needed help sleeping, so...

34:41.664 --> 34:43.291
- You're an asshole.

34:44.793 --> 34:46.585
- How's the water?

34:46.586 --> 34:47.628
- You're in it.

34:47.629 --> 34:50.298
- Yeah, but I want to know
how you like it.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.635
- Fuck you! What if my phone
was in my pocket?

34:54.636 --> 34:56.887
- Ah, it's not.
You left it on the table.

34:56.888 --> 34:58.556
It's been ringing all morning.

35:00.850 --> 35:02.477
- You're still an asshole.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.775
- Give me a kiss.
- You're cold.

35:14.239 --> 35:16.116
Do you want pasta
from last night or hot dogs?

35:16.241 --> 35:17.242
- Hot dogs.

35:17.367 --> 35:19.410
- OK, they're gonna
have to defrost a bit.

35:19.411 --> 35:20.911
- So we have a little time.

35:20.912 --> 35:22.913
- Maybe. What do you
have in mind?

35:22.914 --> 35:24.707
- Nothing that'll take too long.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.501
- Ah...

35:36.010 --> 35:37.220
Oh, fuck.

35:37.345 --> 35:38.387
- Maybe you should...

35:38.388 --> 35:39.597
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:40.515 --> 35:42.434
- Do you want me to...
- No, no.

35:46.479 --> 35:49.691
(Car door closing,
engine starting)

36:08.668 --> 36:10.252
Fuck.

36:10.253 --> 36:12.797
Fuck, this is
a fucking nightmare.

36:14.090 --> 36:15.174
- Shane...

36:15.175 --> 36:17.301
- Oh, fuck, this is
a fucking nightmare.

36:17.302 --> 36:19.888
Oh, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

36:20.013 --> 36:21.138
Ah!

36:21.139 --> 36:23.265
- We should go talk to him.

36:23.266 --> 36:25.685
- Yeah, what if he doesn't
want to talk to me?

36:25.810 --> 36:27.186
What if...

36:27.187 --> 36:28.521
Fuck, my mom!

36:28.646 --> 36:31.148
- Hey, hey, hey,
they will talk to you.

36:31.149 --> 36:33.567
- Yeah, but I fucking
lied to them.

36:33.568 --> 36:35.778
For so many years,
I fucking lied to them,

36:35.779 --> 36:38.113
and now my dad
just walks in on me.

36:38.114 --> 36:39.448
This...

36:39.449 --> 36:41.368
This is my fucking nightmare.

36:41.493 --> 36:44.161
This is my actual
fucking nightmare, Ilya!

36:44.162 --> 36:45.746
- OK, OK.

36:45.747 --> 36:48.583
Then maybe it's time
to wake up, yes?

36:55.131 --> 36:57.008
- Fuck, I'm scared.

36:58.093 --> 36:59.511
- Yes, it's scary.

37:00.387 --> 37:02.179
But you're brave.

37:02.180 --> 37:03.223
- Shut up.

37:03.348 --> 37:04.640
- You are, you're brave.

37:04.641 --> 37:06.351
- I feel like I'm gonna die.

37:07.185 --> 37:08.937
(Sighing)

37:10.855 --> 37:12.691
So much for easing them into it.

37:14.234 --> 37:17.945
- Maybe... maybe he
didn't even notice.

37:17.946 --> 37:18.905
Hmm?

37:19.030 --> 37:20.448
(Chuckling)

37:22.283 --> 37:26.370
- OK, I'm gonna get changed.

37:26.371 --> 37:29.666
I'm gonna drive over. Uh...

37:29.791 --> 37:31.291
And then...

37:31.292 --> 37:33.962
And then fuck!
What am I gonna say?

37:34.087 --> 37:35.421
Oh!

37:35.422 --> 37:37.799
- Do you--do you want me
to come with you?

37:38.967 --> 37:39.926
- Would you?

37:41.052 --> 37:42.721
- Of course.

37:44.139 --> 37:45.640
- OK...

37:46.683 --> 37:48.059
- OK.
- OK.

38:02.907 --> 38:04.743
That--that is not gonna help.

38:05.952 --> 38:08.496
- Oh, they don't know
I play for Boston?

38:16.254 --> 38:19.507
(♪ Pop on radio ♪)

38:26.890 --> 38:28.808
(Kissing)

38:40.445 --> 38:42.864
- Uh, maybe you should
wait in the car.

38:43.990 --> 38:45.659
Fuck, never mind, sorry.

38:58.505 --> 38:59.922
(Door opening)

38:59.923 --> 39:02.133
Hey, it's me, Shane.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.719
Hi.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.055
- I left my charger
at your place,

39:08.056 --> 39:10.266
and it's the old one
that fits into my phone,

39:10.392 --> 39:12.559
and all the other chargers
we have are newer, so...

39:12.560 --> 39:13.977
- It's OK, Dad.

39:13.978 --> 39:16.731
I'm sorry. You shouldn't
have found out that way.

39:18.608 --> 39:20.902
- Found out what, exactly?

39:22.445 --> 39:24.488
- I'm gay.

39:24.489 --> 39:27.741
Which I was gonna tell you soon.

39:27.742 --> 39:30.577
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner. I...

39:30.578 --> 39:32.831
Yeah, and this is Ilya.

39:32.956 --> 39:35.040
Rozanov.

39:35.041 --> 39:36.835
But you already know that.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.086
- Hi.

39:39.170 --> 39:41.381
- He's visiting,
and we're, uh...

39:42.882 --> 39:45.677
- Lovers.
- No, Ilya, that's gross.

39:46.511 --> 39:48.930
- But you hate him.

39:49.973 --> 39:51.098
- No.

39:51.099 --> 39:55.395
I mean, I get that,
but no, I actually, uh...

39:56.354 --> 39:57.772
I love him.

40:01.109 --> 40:03.777
I did not want this
to be how I told you.

40:03.778 --> 40:06.614
Uh, I'm sorry.

40:08.366 --> 40:11.077
Can we just sit down, please?

40:13.204 --> 40:14.622
- Here.

40:16.416 --> 40:20.670
I think we thought
maybe you were gay.

40:21.713 --> 40:22.796
- You did?

40:22.797 --> 40:25.717
- I think we thought
it was certainly possible.

40:25.842 --> 40:27.217
- For how long?

40:27.218 --> 40:29.846
- Mmm, for a while, I guess.

40:29.971 --> 40:32.390
- We both know you
pretty well, Shane.

40:32.515 --> 40:34.768
- I mean,
what we did not suspect

40:34.893 --> 40:38.772
was that you were
so friendly with Rozanov.

40:39.689 --> 40:42.024
- Ilya.
- Ilya, sorry.

40:42.025 --> 40:43.400
- I know.

40:43.401 --> 40:45.653
It's a long story.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.699
- When did this happen?

40:53.286 --> 40:54.578
Wait.

40:54.579 --> 40:56.539
The All-Star game.

40:57.415 --> 40:59.793
You two had so much chemistry.

41:02.170 --> 41:04.506
- No, it was before then.

41:06.466 --> 41:08.092
- Wow!

41:08.093 --> 41:10.970
Wow. Wow.

41:13.640 --> 41:15.016
- So, when?

41:17.811 --> 41:20.270
- Since our, uh, rookie season.

41:20.271 --> 41:21.731
- Since your rookie season?

41:21.856 --> 41:23.649
- No, it's not true.
Since before that.

41:23.650 --> 41:24.775
- Not helpful.

41:24.776 --> 41:25.609
- Before?

41:25.610 --> 41:27.195
- The summer before.

41:28.863 --> 41:30.698
- So you've been
in love since...

41:30.699 --> 41:33.743
- No! No, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

41:33.868 --> 41:36.663
No, just...

41:37.872 --> 41:39.164
- Just what?

41:39.165 --> 41:41.417
- Uh, just...

41:41.418 --> 41:42.711
- Just...

41:43.586 --> 41:44.628
Just...

41:44.629 --> 41:47.048
- Ilya.
- Oh, OK.

41:47.173 --> 41:48.508
- Just what?

41:49.300 --> 41:50.593
- Lovers.

41:50.719 --> 41:53.804
- OK, no one is allowed
to use that word again.

41:53.805 --> 41:57.517
- Well, I would love a drink.

42:02.647 --> 42:05.065
- And there were no nice men
in Montreal?

42:05.066 --> 42:07.610
- I don't know.
Probably there were.

42:08.737 --> 42:10.404
- And do your teammates know?

42:10.405 --> 42:12.532
- No, nobody knows.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.701
- This is good vodka.

42:15.702 --> 42:18.078
- Thanks. I try to buy
the Russian stuff.

42:18.079 --> 42:19.039
- Mmm.

42:20.165 --> 42:21.248
- You never...

42:21.249 --> 42:24.711
I mean, you never let him win,
did you, Shane?

42:26.755 --> 42:28.256
- Do you let Dad win at cards?

42:28.381 --> 42:29.381
- I'd rather die.

42:29.382 --> 42:30.674
- Same here.
- OK.

42:30.675 --> 42:33.302
- So is your plan to, what,

42:33.303 --> 42:38.224
just keep doing this in secret
until you both retire, or...

42:41.603 --> 42:43.646
- Probably. I don't know.

42:44.522 --> 42:46.650
- Probably, yes.

42:47.609 --> 42:50.236
- Oh, no, that's sad.

42:51.321 --> 42:53.073
- I know. We know.

42:54.199 --> 42:58.661
We just can't come out
and, like, announce it.

43:06.378 --> 43:08.797
- Ilya, I gotta say,
I'm surprised.

43:08.922 --> 43:12.132
You have such a reputation
as a ladies' man.

43:12.133 --> 43:14.928
- Mmm. It's not untrue.

43:17.514 --> 43:19.140
- Ilya likes both.

43:19.265 --> 43:20.934
- Oh.

43:22.227 --> 43:25.021
- It's true, I've been
with many women, but...

43:26.147 --> 43:29.275
I have only been in love
with one person.

43:32.195 --> 43:33.570
- Same here.

43:33.571 --> 43:35.115
Only one.

43:47.794 --> 43:49.796
- Well, just...

43:55.135 --> 43:56.678
(Water running)

44:02.058 --> 44:03.810
(Sighing)

44:05.353 --> 44:07.063
- Hey.
- Hi.

44:08.106 --> 44:09.649
Thank you.

44:13.403 --> 44:15.655
(Clears throat)

44:28.293 --> 44:30.211
Mom, um...

44:32.964 --> 44:38.011
I need you to know
that I did really try.

44:39.012 --> 44:41.347
I tried really hard, but, um...

44:42.432 --> 44:44.684
I just can't help it.

44:44.809 --> 44:47.645
And I'm sorry.

44:47.646 --> 44:49.773
- Oh, no, you have nothing,

44:49.898 --> 44:52.232
nothing to apologize for.

44:52.233 --> 44:54.402
Look at me. Look at me.

44:56.446 --> 44:58.198
Look at me.

45:05.330 --> 45:10.043
I'm sorry that I made you feel
like you couldn't tell me.

45:14.506 --> 45:16.132
(Sniffing)

45:18.718 --> 45:20.804
Hey...

45:22.389 --> 45:26.059
I am so, so proud of you.

45:28.103 --> 45:29.479
OK?

45:32.524 --> 45:34.317
Please forgive me.

45:41.658 --> 45:43.743
- I forgive you, Mom.

45:44.577 --> 45:46.329
(Crying)

45:49.666 --> 45:51.167
I love you.

45:52.293 --> 45:54.254
- Oh, I love you too.

45:57.298 --> 45:59.009
So much.

46:05.515 --> 46:07.934
You OK?

46:10.103 --> 46:11.520
Yeah.

46:11.521 --> 46:12.856
(Chuckling)

46:14.232 --> 46:16.943
All right... OK.

46:18.570 --> 46:22.157
OK. OK, OK, enough.

46:23.700 --> 46:25.452
All right, what's the plan?

46:25.577 --> 46:27.162
(Both chuckling)

46:30.540 --> 46:33.417
We need a statement prepared
in case anything leaks.

46:33.418 --> 46:34.835
Something classy and simple.

46:34.836 --> 46:36.211
- Mom...

46:36.212 --> 46:38.840
- And I'm gonna quietly
reach out to the premium brands,

46:38.965 --> 46:41.592
or maybe just Reebok
and Rolex and Speedo.

46:41.593 --> 46:42.926
They'll be thrilled,
I think,

46:42.927 --> 46:44.762
once they wrap
their minds around this.

46:44.763 --> 46:46.430
There's a world
of opportunity here,

46:46.431 --> 46:47.431
if they do it right.

46:47.432 --> 46:49.933
- Mom, can you just take
three steps back, please?

46:49.934 --> 46:52.979
I'm not gonna come out
or anything yet.

46:53.855 --> 46:55.482
We just want...

46:56.441 --> 46:57.816
a future.

46:57.817 --> 46:59.986
I don't know.

47:01.905 --> 47:03.490
- You play in Ottawa?

47:04.574 --> 47:08.160
- Yes. We would be closer,
and with the charity.

47:08.161 --> 47:10.329
- Mmm, and you have no
loyalty to Boston?

47:10.330 --> 47:11.372
- Jesus, Mom!

47:11.373 --> 47:12.873
- What? They drafted him.

47:12.874 --> 47:15.210
You would leave Boston
for Shane?

47:15.335 --> 47:17.170
- Yes.

47:18.254 --> 47:19.380
- Hmm.
- Mom?

47:19.381 --> 47:20.382
- Loyalty is important.

47:20.507 --> 47:22.800
- He's trying to be loyal to me,
not Boston.

47:22.801 --> 47:24.010
- Well...

47:24.135 --> 47:26.261
- My mom cares a little
too much about hockey.

47:26.262 --> 47:28.222
- Now I see
where you get it from.

47:28.223 --> 47:30.057
- Have you talked
to Scott Hunter?

47:30.058 --> 47:31.351
- No.
- I did.

47:31.476 --> 47:32.519
- You did?

47:32.644 --> 47:33.936
- Yeah, briefly.

47:33.937 --> 47:35.939
After MLH award in June.

47:36.064 --> 47:38.692
- And what did he say?

47:38.817 --> 47:40.026
- Nothing.

47:40.151 --> 47:42.903
I didn't tell him
about Shane and me.

47:42.904 --> 47:45.030
But what he did, it was...

47:45.031 --> 47:46.824
- Yes, it was very brave.

47:46.825 --> 47:48.952
- It changed things
for me at least.

47:49.077 --> 47:51.079
Maybe for us.

47:52.956 --> 47:54.290
(Sighing)

47:55.542 --> 47:56.876
Shane...

47:58.545 --> 47:59.879
Shane.

48:02.716 --> 48:04.758
- I'm OK.
I'm just freaking out.

48:04.759 --> 48:05.969
I'll be OK in a second.

48:06.094 --> 48:07.470
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

48:08.555 --> 48:10.557
We're good here.

48:10.682 --> 48:12.892
Your family is here.

48:13.018 --> 48:15.311
Your boyfriend is here.

48:16.479 --> 48:18.898
You're good here, OK?

48:21.484 --> 48:23.278
- My boyfriend?

48:25.030 --> 48:26.614
- I mean, yes.

48:26.740 --> 48:28.950
I think so, probably.

48:36.624 --> 48:38.375
- Since rookie season...

48:38.376 --> 48:39.877
- The summer before.

48:39.878 --> 48:41.421
(Chuckling softly)

48:43.006 --> 48:45.090
- I'll bring the chicken
and some salad stuff.

48:45.091 --> 48:46.425
- Pick up beer in town.

48:46.426 --> 48:47.677
- Please text.

48:47.802 --> 48:49.386
- Why? We'll just
be there around 5:00.

48:49.387 --> 48:51.138
- (Ilya): Please text.
- We'll text.

48:51.139 --> 48:52.348
Pay attention to your phones.

48:52.349 --> 48:53.849
- Thank you for pasta.
- Thank you!

48:53.850 --> 48:55.350
- Drive safely. I love you.

48:55.351 --> 48:56.936
- Love you!
