I texted you, but you didn't reply.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.759
Are you feeling better?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.759
Fran!

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.160
[Ge Kaiyang,]

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.840
[I'm back in Canada.]

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.200
[Watching the sunrise]

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.400
[with you in Lucheng City]

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.760
[was the third wish]

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.640
[I fulfilled for you.]

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.000
[Mom?]

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.040
[What happens]

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.920
[after the genie]

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.840
[from Aladdin's Lamp]

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.120
[grants three wishes?]

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.360
[He becomes free.]

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.920
[Ge Kaiyang,]

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.520
[remember to look up more often.]

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.160
[Remember those]

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.720
[who have shown you kindness]

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.079
[and warmed your heart]

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.440
[when you felt lost.]

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.040
[In the future, when others,]

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.800
[even strangers,]

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.520
[need warmth,]

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.040
[you'll be able to offer them]

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.040
[a light.]

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360
[And I think]

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.680
[your grandma was right.]

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.520
[Animals are truly]

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.960
[easier]

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.520
[to deal with than people.]

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.080
[But]

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.880
[you must remember,]

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.400
[only via communication between people]

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.040
[can we truly empathize]

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.920
[heart-to-heart.]

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.840
[Those who have been warmed by kindness]

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.240
[will become a source of light]

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.440
[for others.]

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.040
[So we are not alone.]

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.240
To match the persona

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.640
of a divorced queen,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.600
we believe Zhang Ran should

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.760
come across as more powerful

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.000
and direct.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.320
This way, it will resonate more

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.520
with a broader audience.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.400
So, we designed

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.360
a scene where she

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.840
tears up the marriage certificate.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.760
That will

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.680
highlight defiant spirit.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.040
Isn't... Isn't this a bit too much?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.920
We've done data research.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.840
Current netizens

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.800
love watching

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.640
edgy, explosive content like this.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.200
Is it possible for us to create

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.600
something that genuinely connects

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.880
with female friends

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.640
on a spiritual level?

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.360
If it just

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.080
ends up being an angry rant,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.600
that's actually pretty low.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.880
Did you actually do proper research?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.440
Did you figure out the persona?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.840
Did you ever put yourself

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.920
in Zhang Ran's shoes?

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.240
You just want attention.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.760
What about the pain points?

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.320
What about viewer loyalty?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.080
If it's...

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.000
that exaggerated scene

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.200
of tearing the certificate...

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.800
I get you.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.600
What we want is a voice for women.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.560
Right.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.960
Chemistry only happens

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.720
on a foundation of empathy.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.600
So, we need to express

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.960
what Zhang Ran wants to say

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.400
by combining her own characteristics.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.600
Create a livestream

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.480
where people laugh at her,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.360
and she laughs back

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.720
because they don't get it.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.560
That's where depth and wisdom come from.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.120
Zhang Ran.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.680
I'm listening.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.280
The company has great confidence

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.560
in your divorced persona.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.040
You are the modern-day Nora.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.760
You represent countless women's yearning

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.880
for a life of freedom.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.800
I understand.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.960
But doing this puts pressure on me.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.280
Relax.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.880
Go home and have a talk

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.480
with your husband.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.760
No persona, no engaging topics.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.160
Understood.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.520
[Zhang Ran,]

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.920
[you've come this far.]

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.920
[To be honest,]

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.920
[Zhang Ran no longer belongs]

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.040
[just to you.]

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.280
[She's now]

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.680
[Tide's flagship,]

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.560
[the top streamer,]

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.280
[the strong queen to so many of us.]

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.720
[Isn't this exactly what you wanted?]

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.560
[You need to understand,]

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.520
[it's not you getting divorced.]

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.360
[It's Zhang Ran.]

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.400
[Zhang Ran is now your superego!]

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.960
[You're back.]

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.160
Come on in.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.600
Change your shoes.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040
Let's have a simple meal.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.800
I thought about it.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.280
I overreacted

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.520
about the whole fake wife thing.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.559
If you really...

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.480
You...

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.040
It's fine. I...

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.280
I know what you're going to say.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.040
Thanks for getting me.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.200
Actually, I...

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.160
I owe you

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.360
an apology.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600
It was my fault.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.240
I didn't keep my emotions

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.320
in check,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.840
and it led to

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.520
a little fight between us.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.520
No matter what,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.880
I'm to blame.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.080
I'm sorry.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.360
Please forgive me.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.080
And there's something

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.680
I need to tell you about.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.600
I also want to tell you something.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.760
You go first.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.720
Li Daoqi

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.920
said he'd tell you.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.560
But I think

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.640
I should say it myself.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.760
It's about the person we talked about.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.280
They've made their choice.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.160
Here's the photo.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.920
Take a look.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.040
If it's not okay,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.600
I can try to negotiate more.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.880
The poster's already done.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.520
That means my opinion

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.680
doesn't matter much then.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.400
Look at that smile of yours.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.720
Heartfelt and affectionate.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Doesn't look fake.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.160
I had no choice.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.080
No choice...

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.960
It's just acting.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.280
Fine, no choice...

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.920
Don't worry. It's just...

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.320
Fu Yudong.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.040
If you want to act,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.560
I'll see it through with you.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.880
And please,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.480
see my scene through as well.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.440
[Isn't that Zhang Ran and Yudong?]

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.480
[I don't think it looks like them.]

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.640
[It does. Of course it does.]

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.640
[It's so similar.]

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.640
[I really don't think it looks like them.]

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.720
[Look! It's them.]

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.040
[Look at those eyes.]

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.640
Ms. Zhou.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.760
Ms. Zhou.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.520
Isn't that Yudong?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.920
This woman isn't Zhang Ran, is it?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.360
Is it the beauty filter?

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.520
No.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.120
You'd recognize them even with a filter.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.840
It looks nothing like them.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.240
What?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.960
You know?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.960
[Yeah.]

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.960
[Fu Yudong's shooting ads. Just acting.]

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.520
What kind of acting is that?

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.960
The posters are everywhere.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.920
How can your dad

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.640
and I face anyone after this?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.920
[What makes you say that?]

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.320
[That serious?]

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.320
You tell me.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.000
Stop talking about other people.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.080
"Chemistry PhD Fu Yudong"

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.560
"devoted eight years"

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.680
"to solving"

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.240
"his wife's allergy problems."

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.320
Who would know it's fake

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.280
or that it's an ad?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:00.920
That's

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.600
his photo on there!

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.880
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.760
[I just can't get through to you.]

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.320
She hung up.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.520
Say something!

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.280
She hung up. So what?

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.920
You call Yudong.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.080
Ask him what this is all about.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.520
What?

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.320
Why should I?

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.160
Ask him

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.640
what's going on!

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.280
I'm not calling.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.680
Whose side are you on?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.680
What do you mean, whose side?

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.840
Ask him what's going on!

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.120
Isn't this embarrassing?

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:32.960
What's

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.440
so embarrassing about it?

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.480
Seriously.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.720
Their business.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.160
It has nothing to do with us.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.560
We're her parents!

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.960
Don't the old neighbors

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.000
recognize us?

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.160
It's just an ad.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.400
I'm embarrassed! You're not?

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.920
You're just too old-fashioned.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.360
Young people are all like this now.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.680
You're jealous, huh?

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.720
Let me tell you,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720
you should really

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.520
learn from your sister.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.360
Look at her and Lu Ming.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.880
They used to control Xinying.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.560
And now?

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.840
They're pursuing

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.720
their own lives now.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.120
Pursuing?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.200
Pursuing my foot!

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.240
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.360
Pursue something? Go ahead!

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.000
You go!

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.640
I can see you're jealous.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.000
So what if I'm jealous?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.440
I'm jealous they can go on trips.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.920
So what if I'm jealous?

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.920
Go then!

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:19.960
Get out!

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.200
What... What happened to you?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.240
Your mom kicked me out.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.960
Changed the bedding.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.680
You moved the bedding

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.040
into that room.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.360
What's going on?

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.800
Are you and Yudong sleeping separately?

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.240
No. Sometimes my live streams

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.720
are loud in my own room.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.640
So he crashes here for a bit.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.960
We have plenty of rooms.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.360
No,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.800
what happened to you?

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.680
What's going on?

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:18.920
Nothing much.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.720
Your mom just tends to go to extremes.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.960
I didn't even say anything.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.080
And it ended up like this.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.280
She kicked me out.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.600
So what exactly

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.120
did you say?

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.080
What could I say?

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.440
Just tried to put in a good word

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.600
for you and Yudong.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.200
See?

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.520
I said whatever you

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.000
and Yudong do

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.960
is for work.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.920
It's all for show.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.320
You can joke about personal stuff,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.800
and Yudong won't get mad.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.000
Now he's come up with a fake wife,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.560
and you won't get mad either.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.320
It's all for show.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.360
How do you know

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.440
I'm not angry

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.640
with him?

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.440
How did you come to that?

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.000
Totally wrong!

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.800
You don't understand anything!

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.480
Just causing trouble here.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.200
I can't believe you.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.600
This is driving me crazy.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.680
[I don't understand?]

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.040
Mom.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.240
Dad's at my place.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.120
I'll ensure he takes this seriously

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.000
and learns from it.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.080
I know you're still upset.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.880
But please,

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.560
could you just

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.440
stop meddling in our business?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.840
You keep getting involved in...

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.520
Great.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520
Now she's ignoring me too.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.280
Neither of us can go home now.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.960
However, what's up with Yudong?

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.360
What's the point of him

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.280
creating a fake wife?

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.520
That's not

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.920
what you're saying earlier.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.320
Changed your tune that fast?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.600
Take a shower if you want.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.360
The bed's ready.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.120
Or watch some TV

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.040
if you want.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.320
Just stay out of my business.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.800
Had I left you to it,

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.600
where would you be now?

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:00.960
Dad?

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.320
Yudong, you're back.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.280
Didn't expect to see you.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.119
[I...]

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.839
I'm just staying over for a bit.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.160
Alright.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.079
You should get some rest.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.359
Gonna take a shower.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.200
[Good night.]

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.040
No idea

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.600
what's keeping Ran so busy

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.680
all day.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.240
She just took off without eating.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.640
Dad, no need to be so formal with me.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.200
Go ahead and eat it.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.000
You have it.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.160
Yudong, don't worry.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.880
I won't be here

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.720
bothering you for long.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.120
When I'm done, I'll go home

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.360
and say sorry to your mom.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.520
Men should be flexible.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.040
Sometimes women

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.320
just need an out.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.560
Mom's really good.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760
She's understanding.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.560
So

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.720
don't argue with Ran.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.480
Apologize to her,

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.080
say something nice, and it'll be fine.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.520
Dad, this isn't something

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.800
that happened overnight.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.320
A single apology

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.360
won't fix it.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.800
I know what you're going to say.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.080
I really understand

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.840
the position you're in right now.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.120
But even when

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.000
couples have conflicts,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.000
you should try to work things out

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.920
through communication.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.680
You can't just keep avoiding.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.600
I'm just a bad example.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.280
Dad, I'm not trying to avoid it.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.920
Since you brought it up,

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.720
let me share

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.560
my thoughts.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.640
Zhang Ran

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.600
is going further

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.160
on the influencer path,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.720
she's really changed a lot.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.840
I even feel like

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.200
she's become a bit of a stranger to me.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.000
I'm not making excuses for her.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.520
But personally,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.400
she hasn't changed at all.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.840
She's still that girl

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.200
with a tiger in her heart.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.120
[You know, back when]

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.240
[she's in second or third grade,]

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.080
[your mom and I were working]

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.920
[at a sugar factory.]

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.520
[It]

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.080
[supplied ingredients for cola.]

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.040
[So every year,]

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.080
[we'd get]

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.880
[crates of cola regularly.]

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.920
[Back then,]

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.520
[cola was really popular.]

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.120
[Ran would sneak a can]

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.240
[to school every day]

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.920
[to share]

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.680
[with her close friends.]

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.320
[She used it]

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.080
[to win over her little buddies.]

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.560
[You know,]

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.480
[she was so little.]

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.640
[But]

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.640
[she had that kind of shrewdness.]

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.640
[She was clever.]

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.880
Thank you, Zhang Ran!

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.120
[Another time,]

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.560
[the school had an out-of-province event]

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.600
[and wanted to put on a talent show.]

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.960
[All the kids were too shy.]

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.440
[No one dared to sign up.]

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.160
[Guess what?]

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.680
[Ran]

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.120
[volunteered]

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.760
[to sing]

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.680
[an English song.]

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.200
[English!]

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.520
[She was only in grade school.]

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.400
[Where did she even learn it from?]

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.880
[And singing, no less.]

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.240
[In the end,]

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.520
[she made a huge splash.]

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.600
[She sang so beautifully.]

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.760
[Later on,]

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.520
[she wanted to be the school flag-bearer.]

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.240
[So she grabbed a bamboo pole]

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.640
[from our courtyard,]

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.080
[tied clothes to it]

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.080
[as a flag,]

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.880
[and practiced all day.]

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.640
[Such a strong competitive drive]

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.720
[at such a young age.]

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.280
[So]

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.320
[she really has known]

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.240
[what she wanted since she was little.]

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.000
[And she would go to any lengths]

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.760
[and work tirelessly]

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.640
[for her goals!]

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.600
[Other kids]

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.280
[would go out to play after school.]

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.800
[But Ran]

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.800
[would come home,]

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.560
[hide in her little room,]

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.640
[listen to English tapes,]

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.960
[and repeat]

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.000
[and practice over and over.]

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.920
[She said]

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.360
[she wanted to be a host.]

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.800
[Look at her now.]

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.160
[She's achieved]

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.720
[all her goals.]

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.440
[So]

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.920
[she doesn't just]

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.400
[like tigers.]

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.120
[She has an ambitious tiger]

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.880
[living in her heart.]

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.320
Sometimes,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.640
in her pursuit of her goals,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.760
she can get a bit extreme

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.000
and might ignore the cost.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.200
I hope you can be understanding.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.520
Dad, I understand

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.600
all that you're saying.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:23.960
To be honest,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.440
I didn't just jump into this

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.120
on a whim

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.000
or in the heat of the moment.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.400
I refused at the very beginning.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.320
But then Li Daoqi told me

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.680
he put everything he had

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.480
on the line

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.840
for this.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.160
He's my best friend.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.200
I couldn't just abandon him.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.920
I did try to explain it to Zhang Ran,

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.360
but she just wouldn't accept it.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.040
So what could I do?

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.680
I couldn't betray

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.680
my friend.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.320
And things

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.800
had already gone this far.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.440
There was no turning back.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.360
I had to grit my teeth and get it done.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.400
But I promise

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.520
this is the first and last time.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800
I'll never agree

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.000
to this kind of marketing again.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:08.920
Let's not talk about it.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.800
To understanding.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.040
Alright.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.320
[Fu Yudong, what are you doing?]

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.560
Well, good question!

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.400
Just now, she's about to lean on you,

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400
and you dodged.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.720
She almost took a nasty fall.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.120
I'm a married man!

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.640
If a woman

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.520
moves in close,

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.640
what else can I do?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.480
My gut reaction is to step back.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.840
She won't bite,

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.480
you know.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.440
I'm not an actor.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.720
Besides, I handled it

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.400
pretty well afterwards.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:02.840
Kidding?

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.040
Look how angry you made her.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.400
Listen,

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.680
take her home first,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.560
then head home yourself.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.240
Got it?

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.400
Why me? You do it.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.680
We're not going the same way.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.200
Take it.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.480
What? What's this?

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.240
Perfume. A client gave it to me.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.040
Cheng Man didn't want it.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.880
Give it to her later.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.800
Don't say it's from me.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.440
No.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.000
Hurry up!

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.560
No!

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.720
Fu Yudong.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.000
Take it.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.760
Just you do.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.880
I'm begging you.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.280
Do it.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.720
You're like a Husky.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:36.800
I'm telling you,

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.720
she doesn't owe us anything.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.040
She's just doing her job.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.640
Be professional? Okay?

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.080
Why do you act like I owe you?

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.680
I'm sorry, really.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.520
Well, thank you.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.280
Really.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.400
Thank you.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.600
Thank you.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.000
What?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.840
Sorry.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.320
Thanks for your hard work today.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.520
See you.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.920
Get ready.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.440
We're gonna

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.360
have dinner with Lady Wan.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.040
Got it.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.000
Miss, I'm so sorry

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.080
for keeping you late today.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.280
I'm clumsy, you know.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.760
You're too kind.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.120
It's okay.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.360
You intellectual types can be

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.440
a bit slow to warm up.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.240
It'll be fine once we're more familiar.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.120
Thank you.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.000
No problem.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.240
By the way.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.720
Do you have any dietary restrictions?

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.000
Dietary restrictions.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.800
I... don't really have any.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.640
I eat everything.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:44.920
What's wrong?

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:45.800
In a couple of days,

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.160
we're attending

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.440
Lady Wan's dinner.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.160
I need to know your restrictions.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.040
So we don't slip up.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.960
So, what...

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.920
What about you?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.040
I don't eat celery.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.800
But I love seafood.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.920
But not raw stuff like sashimi.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.080
I feel safer with cooked food.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.600
You don't eat...

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.520
Don't eat...

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.680
Don't eat celery.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.280
And...

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280
I'm here.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.600
Mr. Fu, I'll get out here then.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.520
Alright.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.800
You love seafood, right?

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.360
Yes.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.640
And you eat raw...

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.240
Okay. Bye.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.440
Cooked... Bye.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.600
Cooked.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.800
Cooked seafood.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.240
No celery.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.040
Nope. No cilantro, but...

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.400
Sir, did she just say

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.920
no celery or cilantro?

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.560
Cilantro.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.600
No cilantro.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120
Fine with celery.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.160
Fu Yudong.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.680
Hello?

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.320
No need for gifts, guys.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.640
No need to send me gifts.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.960
Your brave "no"

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.520
is the best gift you can give me.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.080
Alright?

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:37.720
That's right!

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.160
Thank you all so much for joining

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.400
Zhang Ran's Exclusive Fan Live,

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.080
under 'A Desperate Marriage'.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.120
Thank you.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.440
It's real. Definitely.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.840
The anger is real.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.960
All of my anger is absolutely real.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.080
I want to tell you all,

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.800
if you feel unhappy or uncomfortable,

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.080
have the courage to say no!

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.360
Don't settle. Don't make do.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.280
A woman's worth

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.160
isn't defined by marriage, alright?

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.360
Well said!

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.120
Why? Why?

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.200
Obviously, you're not getting

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.080
the same in return, right?

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.520
You give in, but he doesn't.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.280
What's in it for you?

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.240
Is he

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.920
extremely wealthy,

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.920
or immensely powerful?

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.200
If he ignores you, tell him to get lost.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.840
It's simple. Right?

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.600
Just tell him to get lost.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.520
Don't hesitate.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.400
Alright, time for some talent show.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.000
Alright.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.800
- Guys.
- What's this?

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.800
A soft little piece of paper.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.840
It's actually quite detailed.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.760
Take a look.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.760
Soft piece of paper.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.920
If you're going through

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.200
abuse,

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.800
oppression, or bullying...

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.200
Well, it's soft.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.120
Alright?

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.520
Don't be afraid of being alone!

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.120
We came

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:48.920
into this world alone.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.760
And we'll

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.720
leave it alone too.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:56.880
Open!

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.040
This...

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:05.680
This is

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.440
Mrs. Fu for tonight.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.000
She's

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.280
joining us for the pre-live

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.040
meet-and-greet.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:15.760
Let's go.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.840
Li Daoqi...

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.400
We can't be late today.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.200
I'll explain everything in the car.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.560
This is the product

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.160
we're recommending today.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.360
What can it do?

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.760
Cut through your hesitation

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.840
and obsession,

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.240
chop away your cowardice!

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:43.960
Cool?

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.120
Say goodbye

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.160
to negative energy. Tell it to get lost!

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.040
Alright?

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.840
On the count of three!

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.600
Attention.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.480
Here's the link.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.280
Three, two, one, go!

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.080
Sold out.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.200
You guys are amazing.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:00.720
Wait, no,

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.800
the main focus is chatting.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.760
Selling is just a bonus.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.880
Thank you all for your support.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.600
Thank you.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.200
Next up,

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.400
we've got a boxing course

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.600
for you.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.280
Alright.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.720
Why should we learn boxing?

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.360
Why?

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.000
Well, we women

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.200
are naturally smaller.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.760
Sometimes in life,

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.280
negative energy just pops up.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.120
Then?

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.200
C'mon,

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.400
don't overthink it.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.200
Just punch it away!

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.000
Do it!

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.360
Just one smooth combo, and you're done!

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.160
Amazing!

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:29.920
Guys,

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.880
as long as you throw a punch

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.040
and say no to negative energy,

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.160
it might

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.520
just disappear from your life.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.280
Alright, guys?

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.600
Say goodbye to negative energy!

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.960
Goodbye!

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.640
Next.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.360
Buddy,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.680
just listen to me.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.920
Price this serum

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.880
at 199.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.640
It's a lucky number.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.760
There are

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.560
two reasons.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.880
First, it symbolizes everlasting love,

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.720
also perfectly fits

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.520
the love story

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.760
of Mr. and Mrs. Fu.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.680
Right?

00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.600
Second,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.680
for us men,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.200
there has to be

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.200
wine involved.
[*9 sounds like wine.]

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.040
You agree?

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.200
Mr. Zhang really

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.080
is a master of media marketing.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.280
Good point!

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.520
Well...

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.320
shall we

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:13.920
make a toast?

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.440
To celebrate the success

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.120
of Mr. Fu's MnG,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.080
and thank

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.080
Mr. Zhang

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.320
for introducing us

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.320
to Lady Wan.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:22.400
Dr. Fu.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.320
Thank you.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.000
Alright.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.040
Thank you.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.760
No problem.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:36.840
See that?

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.360
That's what mutual respect

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.320
and harmony in marriage look like.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.719
Dr. Fu.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.679
How did you meet

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:47.960
your beautiful wife?

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.239
I think

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.080
it was something with a cake,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:51.960
right?

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.080
Yes.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.520
That was

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.920
on my 30th birthday.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.280
Mrs. Fu

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.800
really doesn't look her age.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.640
Look at

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.680
her blooming beauty.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.680
Beautiful.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.040
You're beautiful too.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.120
Yes.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.240
She doesn't look her age.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.520
You're too kind.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.560
Mr. Li,

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.320
Dr. Fu,

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.400
you guys

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.600
are all in this together.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.880
But your wives

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.120
don't seem to be acquainted.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.080
Yes, we're really not.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.440
Right.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.880
Well, they were

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.840
living abroad

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.960
before,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.680
so we didn't have many chances

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.400
to...

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.040
Meet up.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.280
Yes.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.160
Understandable.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.600
So I need to

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.040
ask for your advice, Cheng Man.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.640
You flatter me.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.520
Excuse me,

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.040
I need to use the restroom.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.240
You guys carry on.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.840
Alright.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.040
Sit.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.880
Mr. Zhang, when Lady Wan

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.120
comes over,

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.800
please

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.040
put in a good word for me.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.280
Sure thing.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.720
Excuse me.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.000
The media interviews ran over.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.320
Sorry I'm late.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.040
It's been ages.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.360
Mr. Zhang,

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720
thanks to you,

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:15.960
the meeting went well.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.040
Well done.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.640
Dr. Fu and his wife?

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.040
Yes. This is Mrs. Fu.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.880
You performed well today too.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:23.960
Thank you.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.600
Everyone, please sit.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.120
Have a seat.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.080
Please sit.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.520
No dishes yet?

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.520
Can't start without our leading lady.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.080
Exactly.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.040
You're too kind.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.400
Drinks on me.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.400
I'll have them serve the dishes.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.200
I'll go.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.160
I'll do it.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.440
Get some wine for Lady Wan.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.400
My bad.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.480
Shall I do it or you?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.240
I'll do it.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.360
Mr. Zhang, please.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.400
And your wife?

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.000
She's in the restroom.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.680
Hello, ma'am?

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.160
Has Nian had dinner yet?

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.000
Did he eat well?

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.520
Good.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.520
We'll be back right after dinner.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.360
Thank you. See you soon.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.360
Just say

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.400
what's on your mind.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.520
You're not helping him.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.800
You're harming him.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.480
I support him in starting his business.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.200
But not without principles.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.480
It was all my idea.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.160
It has nothing to do with him.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.040
Fu Yudong, you're still harming him.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.320
Fine. It's your idea.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.000
So what does Zhang Ran think?

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.720
We're sort of in the same line of work.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.440
She understands.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.720
I really don't get you two.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.120
How did your life end up like this?

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.800
Is it worth

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.840
sacrificing your own life

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.680
for success?

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.560
It's not too late to stop now.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.040
Come on.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.960
Dr. Fu.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.080
Come on.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.360
Dr. Fu,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.520
gonna propose a toast to you.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.640
Have some red wine.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.040
It's gone. We'll have baijiu.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.480
Oh, alright.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:40.960
Thank you.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.760
To you.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.720
Mrs. Fu, to you.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.600
She can't drink.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.680
I'll drink for her.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:46.960
Alright.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.600
Thank you.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.360
Oh my, you're a good drinker.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.320
Take it easy, Yudong.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.160
Dr. Fu,

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.880
your brand topped

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.760
the trending list

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.600
after the MnG.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.160
Bringing your wife on the live stream

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.280
is a nice touch.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.760
Anything you livestream

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.120
is guaranteed to blow up.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.760
That's because

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.040
their product quality is top-notch.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.480
If Dr. Fu's brand

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.520
sells out,

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.960
I might

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.160
not have time

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.240
for other brands later.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.720
A drink on me.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.120
Don't say that, Lady Wan.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.000
All my clients

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.200
are counting on you.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.000
Why are you just standing there?

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.680
Lady Wan, even a tiny sliver

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.840
of your precious time

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.400
is enough for us.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.680
Time also comes at a cost.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.400
The thing is, it's not up to me now.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.040
The company is watching me closely.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.640
Right?

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.560
Everyone needs to make money.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.680
Understood.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.880
Well, we'll discuss it later.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.360
Just drink. Lady Wan, to you.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.520
Sorry for the trouble.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.760
Sorry for that.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.440
I'll down it. You take it easy.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.640
That's just how he is.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.000
When he's expressing

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.320
gratitude,

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.040
he gets happy and likes

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.000
to down it in one go.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.800
What are you doing?

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:02.760
Bottoms up.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.520
You...

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.760
[Today's live show was a success.]

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.040
[Everyone did a great job.]

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.360
Who should our applause go to?

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.680
Tide's top streamer!

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.000
Tide's top streamer!

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.280
[Lady Wan,]

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.000
[what do you think of this Mrs. Fu?]

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.360
[I'm very pleased]

[You picked a good one.]

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080
Go back and get ready.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:55.440
Alright.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.480
See you in the Double 11 live stream.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:56.840
Thank you.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.440
Lady Wan.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.520
Pleasure working with you.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.880
Yudong, we won.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.280
Sorry, then I...

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.640
We almost forgot our leading lady.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.480
Today's performance is over.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.080
Thanks for your hard work.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:20.560
Thanks.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.120
Appreciate it.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.040
Please get in the car.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.200
Take care of him.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.840
It's fine.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.560
Get in.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.600
Yudong, let's go.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.640
What did we win?

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.600
They'd

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.680
keep their promise

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:34.680
and clear out

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.400
all our stock.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.400
Isn't that a win?

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.440
You really went all out today.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.200
Amazing. Let's go.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.760
Glad we won.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.920
Why did you close the door?

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.360
You go home.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:48.760
What are you doing?

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.640
I'll walk a bit.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.920
To clear the smell of alcohol.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.720
I can't go back like this.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.440
I'll walk with you then.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.160
No need.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.240
What's wrong?

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.640
Cheng Man is in the car.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.040
Doesn't matter.

I just told her to go back first.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.640
Just go. Don't worry about me.

Can you handle it?

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.640
I'm fine.

But...

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.760
Careful with your foot.

Take cutting a timber, for example.

Every measurement

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.800
and cut matters.
