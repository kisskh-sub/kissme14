[Episode 29]

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.090
What I need now

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.770
is a direct negotiation
with the Portuguese Macau government.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.340
I should first figure out

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.660
the whole story and their demands.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.710
Got it.

[Loyalty, Strength, Success, Morals]

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.930
I'll go talk to them.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.770
However,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.759
since both sides are in an armed standoff,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.979
I'm afraid it'll take some time

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.950
to arrange an negotiation.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.280
Chief,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.350
what exactly should we do now?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.800
Wang Qiuzai and the guys...

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.970
are still hiding
in that covert opium den of yours, right?

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.750
All the other men are at the hotel

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.790
as you instructed.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.320
Wang Qiuzai and the guys
are waiting outside.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.530
Go tell him

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.970
to carry out an urgent task.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.590
Remember,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.940
it must be

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.380
a success.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.570
Failure is not allowed.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.140
Come out!

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.250
-Open up!
-Hurry!

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.080
What's going on?

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.880
What is this for?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.180
You lot!

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.460
Get all of them out!

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.300
You guys,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.470
bring them into custody!

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.240
Be quick!

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.980
Move it!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.860
Move it!

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.630
Hey, don't hurt me!

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.090
Stay in line!

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.470
Go!

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.900
Be quick!

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.630
Keep up. Move it!

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.560
Anyone unfound?

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.630
Hurry!

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.520
Search!

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.190
Stay close!

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.560
This way!

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.579
Come out!

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.779
Still couldn't get through?

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.000
Perhaps
the hotel's phone lines have been cut.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.810
If that's the case,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.570
Miss Qiao has most likely

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.500
fallen into the Special Ops' grip.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.590
What are you doing?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.880
Search quickly.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.280
Captain Huang needs us
in the hospital now.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.870
Why the hospital?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.400
Asahina is said to have luckily

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.630
survived.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.680
It's time to end his life.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.750
Chief,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.780
Consul Imai is asking again

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.510
if we've arranged a meeting
with the Portuguese Macau government.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.320
Tell him

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.110
I'm working on it.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400
It's almost done.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.160
Off you go.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.580
Talk to Wang Qiuzai.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.350
Check on the progress.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.990
Mr. Huang,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.250
we've checked the front and back yards
several times.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.250
Something's off.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.630
Usually,
the whole place is heavily guarded

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.690
by the members of Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But somehow nobody is around today.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.470
Only Fei has come out for a patrol.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.490
Besides,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.810
only two officers are left on duty

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.340
in the police booth at the intersection.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.890
How come you still don't get it?

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.910
Tension has built up
at the East Asia Hotel.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.850
Both the Portuguese police
and Tai Ho Brotherhood are drawn to it.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.180
Now is the best time for you
to take action.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.690
Got it.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.270
Don't worry, Mr. Huang.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.000
I guarantee it'll be a success.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.640
No.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.240
Don't take action now.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.300
Postpone it to an hour later.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.500
Got it.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.390
Chief,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.490
why postpone it to an hour later?

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.570
Taking action early

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.750
might alert our target.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.480
Then how will I get He Xian here
for a negotiation?

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.700
Are you an idiot?

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.560
Have this message delivered.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.720
Just say it's from Consul Imai
to De Solaire.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.250
Do it now!

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.970
Yes.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.310
What are the Japanese saying?

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.430
Imai asks to negotiate
with a representative

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.370
who must reach the hotel in an hour.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.860
Given the current situation,
there's no way Imai will come out.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.200
It makes sense that he asks to talk
to a government representative.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.970
No, no, no.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.300
Imai refuses to meet government officials.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.870
He has designated someone specific
for the negotiation.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.100
No substitution is allowed,
or he won't negotiate.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.360
Who has he designated?

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.690
Look up!

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.100
Call the Portuguese Macau government

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.160
and urge them to make a decision soon.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.540
This is a dedicated phone line.
Why is it busy?

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:08.860
-Hello?
-Hello?

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.850
Hello, Xian.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.910
Yinwan?

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.160
About Fukue's case,
a thief is crying "stop thief!"

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.290
Hello?

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.150
What did you say?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.790
Yinwan?

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.690
Yinwan?

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.650
What happened?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.430
Was it Miss Qiao?

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.390
Yes.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:47.790
What did she say?

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.660
She only said one thing:

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.040
"About Fukue's case,
a thief is crying 'stop thief!'"

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.440
I dialed back,
but it couldn't get through.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.350
"A thief is crying 'stop thief...'"

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.860
You'd better behave, woman.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.020
Chief.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.370
Keep close watch!

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.230
That woman Qiao Wanyin said

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.540
she felt scared alone in the room,

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.630
so she wanted to call

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.760
the police for help.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.010
As she was making the call,

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.320
our men barged in.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:50.640
Are you sure

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.620
she was calling the police

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.600
instead of

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.690
tipping someone off?

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.630
She's been in her room the entire time.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.170
I don't think she knows anything.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.030
Even if she has contacted someone,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.430
nothing much would've been leaked, right?

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.150
Sawa Eisaku?

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.120
He killed Fukue?

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.060
How else can Miss Qiao's words
be interpreted?

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.120
The situation has been escalated

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.280
little by little by the Fukue case.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.350
I don't think Sawa Eisaku happens

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.240
to use this as a springboard
for his own agenda—

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.620
it seems to be too much of a coincidence.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.720
The Fukue case has always

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.090
smelt fishy to me.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.710
Based on what Miss Qiao said today,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.170
if Sawa Eisaku really

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.480
is the mastermind behind this,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.770
then all our questions can be answered,

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.490
and all that has happened
can be explained.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.650
That's right.
Only in this way can all coincidences

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.600
fall into place—
they were part of an elaborate scheme.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.130
Then what are we waiting for?

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.460
Let's reveal the truth now.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.440
Then he'll be done for, won't he?

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.120
No.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.180
We have no evidence at the moment.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.330
Miss Qiao's mere words

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.530
can't prove anything.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.380
Hello.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.980
Your Excellency the Governor.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.160
As the Empire's consul in Macau,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.000
why should I negotiate

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.170
with a private Chinese merchant?

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.600
Is it supposed to be a joke?

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.190
No, I'm not joking.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.060
No one but He Xian

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.450
is to negotiate with you.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.210
Why?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.570
Because He Xian

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.890
not only leads the Chinese community,

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.380
but has also long manipulated
the Portuguese Macau government.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.500
In current Macau,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.760
what the Portuguese Macau government says
isn't necessarily effective.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.310
Only He Xian

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.480
is the real decision-maker.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.520
Does a Chinese merchant
really carry so much weight?

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.720
Yes. Otherwise,

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.700
why would the Portuguese Macau government

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.240
grant him plenipotentiary powers
to negotiate with you?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.350
But he's just a merchant after all.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.130
He Xian

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.920
is no ordinary merchant.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.840
He's the brains behind
all the underground anti-Japanese forces.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.210
All anti-Japanese elements and activities

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.670
are covertly under his control and command.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:23.960
Mr. Imai,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.340
to find out the truth of the Fukue case

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.900
and to finish the task
assigned by the Command,

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.070
you must crack He Xian.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.350
Don't forget that you, Mr. Imai, are

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.440
still surrounded by

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.600
Portuguese military police.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.670
That's true.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.960
But if he really leads
the anti-Japanese forces in Macau

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.220
and even engineered the Fukue incident,

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.360
will he ever come to this hotel?

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.980
Suppose he comes,
will he voluntarily confess?

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.320
As long as he's here,

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.940
I'll make him confess in my own way.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.940
In fact, I've kept an eye

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.850
on this man for three whole years.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.940
I know him too well.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.590
He...

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.870
will definitely come.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.070
Xian, this is obviously a trap.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.300
You must not go.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.830
Master Huang is right.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.960
Imai has just reached Macau.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.140
How did he get to know you?

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.170
Why would he specifically ask you

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.700
to negotiate with him
on the government's behalf?

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.860
This is clearly a scheme of Sawa Eisaku's.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.870
All he wants is for you to enter
the Special Ops' office.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.820
Xian, as you said before,

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.150
Sawa Eisaku has had it in for you
for a long time.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.440
Back then, he even had the nerve

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.840
to shoot Mr. Liang dead in public.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.490
Now,
the situation is even worse as both sides

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.200
are armed to the teeth
at the East Asia Hotel.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.720
Conflict could break out at any moment.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.540
Is there any reason to risk your life

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.670
for the Portuguese Macau government?

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.210
I know
you're all concerned about my safety.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.810
But I must attend this negotiation.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.600
Xian...

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.830
Please listen to me.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.470
Now, we have figured out

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.100
Sawa Eisaku is the real culprit
behind the Fukue case.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.440
Only by affirming the truth

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.500
in Imai's presence

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.090
will the enemy's defense
collapse on its own.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.060
But since Imai arrived in Macau,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.050
Sawa Eisaku has always

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.510
kept him away from others.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.520
I can't meet with Imai

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.030
unless I go to the East Asia Hotel

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.630
as the negotiator for Macau.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.200
Xian,

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.900
since Sawa Eisaku has set a trap for you,

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.230
he must've devised various plans
to take you down.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.090
He won't easily let you see Imai.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.740
Even if you get to meet with Imai,

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.070
you won't be able to present any evidence.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.450
Then we'd better
prepare for all possibilities.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.310
Dr. Ke,

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.130
it's best if you can rouse Asahina

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.200
from unconsciousness.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.160
If you can't,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.800
it's all the more reason for me to go.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.730
You mean...

Sawa Eisaku

Only when I'm in the East Asia Hotel

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.520
can I find a chance

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.200
This is detrimental

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:05.590
to you and Macau.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.950
You have to admit that, right?

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.720
Then what's the "lesser evil"?

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.130
Of course it means turning in the supplies

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.460
that Huang Sanhe and Rodrigues

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.750
risked their lives to protect for you.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:21.180
We both know what happened.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.510
Don't try to deny it.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.500
Certainly, you're reluctant
to hand over these supplies.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.070
But compared with the safety of Macau

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.180
and safeguarding the future operations

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.310
of the supply route you've just built,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.900
a shipment of supplies

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.870
barely amounts to anything.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.610
Mr. He,

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.640
let's make a deal.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.140
All I need

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.510
from you is an address.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.090
Upon getting the goods,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.270
I promise you will no longer have anything

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.700
to do with this matter.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.500
Consul Imai and I will be credited with it
and have something

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.760
to report to the brass.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.550
The Imperial Army
will be benefited as well.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.590
As for

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.850
Fukue Yasumitsu's incident

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.140
and Rodrigues' death,

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.530
let's say it's even.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.580
If you agree,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.030
the Imperial Army

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.870
will withdraw immediately,

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.610
and the seal on Macau will be lifted.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.470
What do you think?

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.130
Trading a shipment of supplies

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.610
for the safety of Macau

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.940
and the future security
of your underground supply route

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.240
is truly the lesser

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:34.700
of the two evils

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.720
for you and Macau, right?

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.260
The message for the Allied Forces is sent.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.120
It's your turn.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.260
I have two telegrams to send.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.710
One is for Commander Ou.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.740
As for the other,
adhere to this frequency.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.100
Upon receiving these telegrams,

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.550
Commander Ou and the East River Column

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.050
will surely give all they have to

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.180
support the operations in Macau.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:17.980
Okay.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.760
"Commander Zeng Sheng
of the East River Column,

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.530
I am the Buddha's Hand.
To help Macau out of the crisis,

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.410
I'm now requesting your troops to launch

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.670
relevant military operations today
as fast as possible."

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.830
Mr. Huang, can you guarantee it?

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.270
As I said just now,

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.980
all members old and young
across different branches

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.960
halls, posts and stations

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.760
of Tai Ho Brotherhood
amount to over 3,000,

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.450
and vessels big and small to 600.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.070
They've all received
messages by carrier pigeons,

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.900
and are now on the way to Macau.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.010
In just a few hours,

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.140
they'll blockade the waters in Macau.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.800
As soon as the Japanese start a war,

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.660
all 600 of our ships will break through
the passes together,

00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:59.640
so as to make sure

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.240
you and your families be immediately

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.900
evacuated from Macau safely.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.510
Should anyone be left behind,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.030
you can take my life.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.320
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.920
with this guarantee
from Tai Ho Brotherhood,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.920
what else do you have to worry about?

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.560
Terrific.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.440
I hereby promise that this time,

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.160
the Macau government will surely

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.670
stand with Mr. He

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.210
and the entire Chinese community

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.530
through thick and thin.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.690
Together, we'll fight the Japanese

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.800
till the very end!

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.690
While you were away,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.420
we kept monitoring his condition,

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.060
which showed signs of deterioration

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.370
instead of improvement.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.700
There's absolutely no way for the patient

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.120
to wake up in a short time.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:56.960
No one else knows it, right?

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.020
Yes, rest assured.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.370
The doors and curtains
have been kept closed.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.610
The equipment and medicine

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.870
we're using on the patient
are consistent with his condition,

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:05.950
which is supposedly improving.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.010
The Japanese won't notice anything.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.040
But I'm afraid we can't

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:12.420
conceal the truth forever.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.580
Let's drag it out

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.510
for as long as possible.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:20.670
The next few hours are crucial.
[Ward 2]

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.090
Let the patient recover properly.
Don't rush.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.040
Dr. Ke.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.390
How is Secretary Asahina?

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.900
Not very good,

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.590
considering he's been severely injured.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.760
I'm afraid you'll have to wait

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.580
a few hours before questioning him.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.510
But don't worry.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.420
When the patient comes to,

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:43.400
I'll notify you and the police right away.

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:44.750
Thank you.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.430
No problem.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.580
[Ward 2]

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.220
Director Ke!

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.540
The police just brought in
two wounded people,

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.140
who are said to be
Mrs. He and her daughter.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.140
They're now asking to see you.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.120
Mrs. He?

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:03.970
Where are they?

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:04.950
In your office.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.580
Qiwen.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.120
Dr. Ke.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.840
Dr. Ke.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:23.090
Where is Xian?

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.070
I need to see him.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.010
He's really busy right now.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:28.000
What happened?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.930
Tell me. No rush.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.740
His father...

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.690
His father and son are in danger.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.000
Mr. He,

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.200
you've contemplated for a long time.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.700
Haven't you made a decision yet?

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.030
Oh.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.070
Being busy waiting

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:12.230
for Consul Imai to come negotiate,

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.370
I've completely

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:14.920
forgotten

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:18.260
that multiple-choice question from you,
Colonel Sawa.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.090
What is it?

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.330
Colonel Sawa, you insist

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.780
that I've hidden
a large amount of supplies,

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.510
and that I should hand them over

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.740
to protect Macau from being captured
by the Japanese Imperial Army.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.700
But I'm really puzzled.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.750
Let's say I have hidden
a large shipment of supplies.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.380
Won't the Imperial Army find them out

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.710
after occupying Macau?

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.550
Make one move,
and you'll enjoy the spoils of war.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.610
What's the point of this politeness?

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:48.880
Colonel Sawa,

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.730
are you doing charity work?

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.730
Let me venture a guess about the truth.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.300
Before getting hold of these supplies,

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.920
there's no way you can

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.630
persuade the Japanese Imperial Army

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:05.670
to attack Macau.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.900
Suppose

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.240
I fell for your trick

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.570
and gave away
those so-called strategic supplies,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.460
then you, Colonel Sawa,

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.370
would attain solid evidence

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.710
to prove Macau to be
an anti-Japanese stronghold,

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.810
and the Japanese Imperial Army

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.900
would have a legitimate reason
to occupy Macau.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.420
That would make me

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.730
a fraud victim who actually helped

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.110
the fraud happen.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.480
This really is

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.850
a clever scheme.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.890
Vicious.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.220
Impressive.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.320
He Xian,

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:50.910
I kindly offered you advice.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.960
I gave you a chance.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.200
Take it,

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.010
or trouble awaits you.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.380
I'd rather believe
the sun rises from the west

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:07.860
than a single word of yours, Colonel Sawa.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.290
You!

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.560
I am the negotiator for Macau.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.640
Now, only Consul Imai Keiichi

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.960
has the authority to negotiate with me.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.630
I'm not interested in talking

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:18.490
to anyone else.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:23.950
Fine.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.160
Okay.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.590
Then keep waiting.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.140
Let's see

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.600
what this long wait will bring you.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.420
Chief,

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.280
He Xian has turned a deaf ear to...

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.150
Chief,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.980
He Xian just wouldn't give in.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.040
What is there to do?

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040
No need to rush.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.010
Wang Qiuzai has finished the job, right?

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.650
Shall we just show our trump card

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.650
and tell He Xian
his father and son are in our hands?

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:20.690
What's the hurry?

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.850
With his wife and daughter having escaped,

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.480
do we need to be the ones
to break the bad news to him?

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.940
Won't it produce better effects
if his wife tells him herself?

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.090
That's brilliant.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.719
When his wife starts wailing and crying,

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:36.010
let's see if he'll remain this stubborn.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:54.560
Lin!

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:55.909
Lin.

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:00.260
Baixin,

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:02.010
keep her company.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.770
I-I'm just leaving

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.520
the room.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.210
Sweetie,

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.490
don't be afraid.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:14.790
We calculated everything...

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.940
But we just overlooked the possibility
that these punks

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.390
would be so ruthless
as to target Xian's family.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:22.750
This is all my fault.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.320
I shouldn't have

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.040
impulsively pulled the guards
from Xian's family.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.170
Look what a mess this is.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:28.580
How do I explain to Xian?

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.460
I can't believe
they could still deploy resources to this,

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.720
despite the chaos at the East Asia Hotel.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.010
This is not your fault, Master Huang.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.500
Now, the problem is

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.810
Xian hasn't got the news yet.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:41.300
Should we tell him?

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.490
No, we must not.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:47.690
Xian is in danger at the moment

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.010
and risking his life
to stall the Japanese.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:50.650
If we tell him

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.110
that his father and son
have been kidnapped,

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.860
he'll break down.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.010
I agree.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.390
We must not tell him the news now.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.120
But his father and son
were taken by the enemy.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.520
Even if we don't tell him,

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:05.070
the enemy will.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.410
Mrs. He.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:23.400
Zhengping is correct.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.420
Even if we don't tell him,

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:26.970
the Japanese will.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.920
I'd rather give him the news myself
than let the Japanese

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.650
threaten him with this matter.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.440
Mrs. He...

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.460
I know Xian well.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.500
I trust him.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.100
He knows what's important

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.150
and what he needs to do.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:14.710
Mr. He,

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.260
getting impatient, aren't you?

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.740
I'm terribly sorry.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.340
Consul Imai

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.570
is still asleep.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.090
I'm not sure when he's available
for a meeting with you.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:29.800
Consul Imai is besieged

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.780
in the hotel
by hundreds of military police officers,

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.950
yet he's not worried.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:33.940
Why should I be?

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:36.610
Colonel Sawa, it seems

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.170
you're the one getting impatient.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.020
Am I?

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:43.860
Aren't you?

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.200
Hello.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.600
Mr. He,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.160
a call for you.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:14.050
It sounds like...

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.960
your wife.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.270
Hello?

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.570
Qiwen,

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.740
why are you calling me here?

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.360
What did you say?

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.100
About an hour ago,

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.270
a group of masked kidnappers
came to our home.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.860
They killed Fei,

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:53.720
and took away Father

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.600
and our son.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:01.220
Qiwen,

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.070
how are you and our daughter doing?

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.790
We...

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.980
We're fine.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.180
We managed to escape.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.060
We're at Dr. Ke's place now.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.820
Xian,

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.260
the police are looking for them,

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.010
but haven't got a finding.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.520
What can we do?

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.420
Calm down.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.430
I'll think of something.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.080
Anything wrong?

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.840
Did something happen to your family?

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.670
Judging by your expression,

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.260
it must be a serious incident.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:42.250
Mr. He,

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.330
if necessary,

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.150
go and attend to this urgent family issue.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.590
Family comes first.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.330
The negotiation can wait.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:50.930
Sure.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.980
But before that, I'd like to say goodbye

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.840
to Consul Imai.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.530
Sorry.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:56.920
As I said,

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.080
Consul Imai is resting.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.720
Just go ahead and do your business.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.930
I'll inform him later.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.270
Colonel Sawa, it seems

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.040
you already knew
something would happen to my family.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.870
You were waiting for this call

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:12.870
the entire time, weren't you?

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.410
Listen to yourself!

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.520
How would I know

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.210
if your wife would call or not?

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:24.680
It doesn't matter

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.250
whether you knew or not.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.870
As soon as I leave,

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.000
Consul Imai

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.200
will definitely receive a report from you,

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.400
saying that Macau's negotiator He Xian

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.850
has refused to meet him,

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:37.250
canceled the negotiation,

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.500
and left without consent.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.590
You'll say that Macau

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.120
has chosen to forsake peace

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:42.950
and to fight till the very end.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:44.280
Am I right?

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.760
Mr. He.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.110
Mr. He!

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.610
You're mistaking my kindness for enmity!

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:56.220
Fine.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.720
I'll say no more.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:01.860
Do whatever you want

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.710
with your family matters.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.510
Qiwen.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.110
I know you and our daughter

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.510
really need me right now.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.880
But I must stay where I am
for a significant issue.

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:36.690
I can't come to you now.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:39.240
No need to apologize.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.260
I understand.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.800
I know your position.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.460
I really do.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.700
Put our daughter on the phone.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.640
Come on.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.350
Say something to Daddy.

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:49.650
Daddy.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:51.970
Sweetie,

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.490
are you scared?

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.320
Yes.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.020
Daddy knows you're frightened,

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.550
and that you're worried about

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.010
Grandpa and your brother.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:01.920
Here's what you do.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.970
Go take a nap.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.350
Clear your mind.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.650
When you wake up,

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.000
Grandpa, your brother,

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.130
and Daddy will all be home with you.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:11.730
Okay?

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.410
Really?

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:17.260
When has Daddy ever lied to you?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.460
I'll listen to you then, Daddy.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.040
I'm going to take a nap now.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.660
Good girl.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.260
Come on,

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.610
let me talk to Daddy.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:26.260
Okay.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.030
Xian...

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.910
I know

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.880
there is a lot on your shoulders.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:38.840
Don't worry.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.870
I'll take good care of our daughter.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.060
As for Father and our son,

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:47.200
with so much help
from the police and our friends,

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.690
I'm sure they'll be found.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.770
Just as what you always say,

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.840
no matter what happens...

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:56.900
Xian,

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:02.060
things will work themselves out
in the end.
