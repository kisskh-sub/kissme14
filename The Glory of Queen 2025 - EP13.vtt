[The Glory of Queen]

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.500
[Episode 13]

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.820
Mother,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.620
I really didn't do anything like that.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.140
Please don't take their word for it.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.380
Mother.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.380
Then explain!

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.340
What's the story with the banknote?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.780
You've really disappointed me.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.100
Mother...

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.740
I really didn't do it.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.420
The workshop...

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.380
The workshop!

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.420
Mother,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.460
I've already found the place

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.940
where the Pei family's products
were being counterfeited.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.300
The person behind

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.100
it is extremely familiar
with our family's methods and formulas.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.790
I fear… I fear
that someone within the household

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.660
may be stealing from us.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.740
Please give me a little more time,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.900
and I will surely
get to the bottom of it.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.980
Mother.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
For now, let's focus on investigating
the counterfeit workshop.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.700
As for Zhiyao's kidnapping,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.660
I will ensure
a proper explanation is given.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.340
How's your injury?

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.580
It's almost healed.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.620
That's good to hear.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.100
Lan.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.420
Since you and Zhiyao
are already married,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.220
you should arrange for her to conceive
as soon as possible.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.420
Your grandmother is still waiting.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.420
Zhiyao and I
are getting along just fine.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.220
It's just that Jingheng
doesn't seem quite used to the fact

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.020
that Zhiyao is no longer his maid
but my wife.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.900
He still comes to see her
from time to time.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.900
Indeed, they should mind the boundaries
between men and women.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.300
Since Zhiyao is already married,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.380
Jingheng's behavior

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.180
is truly inappropriate.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.060
Then why won't you
speak up for me, Father?

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.700
Jingheng and I are both men. If…

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.780
If I had been the one chosen back then,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.260
I would have done
just as well as he did.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.260
Lan,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.260
I've often regretted it
over the years, too.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.420
If I had trained you back then,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.820
you wouldn't be struggling
like this now.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.860
I'm sorry.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.300
My Lady, have you taken note

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.660
of everything I've said?

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.700
I have. Thank you, Madam Li.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.820
What are you doing here?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.940
Are you disappointed in the Pei family?

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.740
No, not really.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.500
At least,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.620
someone is still standing up for me.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.060
You take a seat. I'll leave now.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.020
I will definitely give you
an explanation.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.020
Trust me.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.860
Jingheng, you're here, too?

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.580
Jinglan.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.620
Take this out.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.740
Yes.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.220
I noticed you've lost
some weight lately,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.500
so I made
some nourishing dishes for you.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.500
Let's eat first.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.220
Jingheng, are you joining us?

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.340
Second Young Master just said
he's going to Tianxiang Pavilion.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.910
How could meeting outsiders
be more important

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.940
than having a meal with family?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.540
Jinglan, I hope you don't mind.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.940
I'll have a taste.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.620
I didn't know you'd be here.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.780
If I had known, I'd have cooked more.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.940
These

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.180
are all my wife's favorite dishes.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.860
That won't be a problem, Jinglan.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.820
I may be picky,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.540
but my tastes

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.260
happen to be very similar
to Lady Song's.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.620
These dishes suit me perfectly.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.660
Eat this.
I've removed all the bones for you.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.500
Jinglan, she doesn't like fish.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.740
It's too fishy for her.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.060
Oh, well, I'll help her take care of it.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.860
Jingheng, you still act
the same way you did as a child.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.500
Jinglan, you're no different.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.940
Honestly,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.500
it's been ages
since we last ate together.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.020
This is truly a rare occasion.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.380
Jinglan,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.420
you should eat, too.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.660
Lady Song, don't hold back.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.820
These are all your favorite dishes.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.140
You two

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.620
can enjoy your meal together.
I'll leave now.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.180
You really won't eat any?

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.260
Yes, this is the one.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.620
My Lady,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.860
I've noticed you usually like

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.820
those light-scented sachets.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.500
Will you teach me how to make them?

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.020
You want to learn
how to make fragrances?

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.140
I've always wanted to learn,

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.140
but unfortunately, I'm a man.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.260
In my father's eyes,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.340
rather than learning fragrance-making,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.380
I should be learning
how to serve my wife properly

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.620
and win her favor.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.420
What does it matter
if you're a man or a woman?

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.940
As long as you are willing to learn,
I'll teach you.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.820
Sure.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.940
Have a smell.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.140
When making fragrance,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.300
never rush.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.020
You must stay calm and focused.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.540
Any additions or reductions
should be tried in small amounts.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.020
Even the smallest difference

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.300
can affect

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.020
the final scent and effect.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.500
Why don't you give it a try?

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:17.900
Sure.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.060
Put this into that.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.620
All right.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.420
When making fragrance, never rush.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.300
You must stay calm and focused.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.740
Any additions or reductions
should be tried in small amounts.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.420
Even the smallest difference

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.460
can affect the final scent and effect.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.420
The things I once taught you,

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.460
you're now teaching to another man.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.300
Song Zhiyao, you're really something.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.940
Now, add those in.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.260
What's wrong?

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.700
Nothing.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.620
It seems a little injured kitten
just ran past.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.060
Mix in a bit more of this.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:27.061
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:21.740
This?

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.660
Would this be enough?

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.460
Pei Jingheng,

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.180
now that we're in-laws,

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.780
we should mind our boundaries.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.060
Divorce Jinglan.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.940
I… I can't divorce him.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.100
Is this how you treat me now?

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.140
Say what you have to say,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.820
but keep your hands off me.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.420
Do you dislike me?

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.500
Why are you being so unreasonable?

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.740
So, in your eyes,
I'm being unreasonable?

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.700
If that's what you want to think,
there's nothing I can do.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.580
Are you really that attached to Jinglan?

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.500
Yes, yes. Whatever you say.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.420
Song Zhiyao.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.860
Pei Jingheng,

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.380
I don't want to argue with you.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.460
Do whatever you like.

I... I'm fine.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.900
Why are you still up?

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.500
It's getting cold.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.300
Ginger soup helps ward off the chill.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.500
I'll go rest after you drink it.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.060
Eldest Young Master,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.700
there's no need for this.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.420
What we agreed upon

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.940
doesn't oblige you to do any of this.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.100
I treat you well because I want to,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.500
not because of our agreement.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.140
Just as I suspected.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.260
I'd like to see

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.780
how you try to deny it this time.
