[Episode 30]

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.180
Xian.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.280
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.020
If Asahina wakes up,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.330
I'll find a way to send you a message:

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.090
"Fortune favors the good."

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.320
But if the message I receive is

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.140
"We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it,"

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.210
then it means
Asahina really can't wake up.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.700
If that's the case,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.630
we'll need to work together,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.430
just as you said—

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.650
using the body

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.200
to draw the real enemy out of hiding.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.730
Yes.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.940
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.710
Qiwen,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.310
I understand.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.740
Everything will be fine.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.329
Colonel Sawa.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.810
Let's put my family matters aside for now.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.230
You don't need to worry about it.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.430
I'll continue to wait

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.280
until Consul Imai

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.520
comes to meet me.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.730
Okay.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.730
Very well.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.560
Then...

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.350
let's just keep waiting.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.240
Colonel Sawa,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.010
didn't you say you knew He Xian inside out

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.940
and could definitely make him confess?

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.470
It's been so long! What's the progress?

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.530
He Xian

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.450
is indeed not easy to deal with.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.490
Please give me more time.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.700
I'll definitely find another way.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.130
General Matsui

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.320
has already called twice,
pressing for results!

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.540
I can wait, but the Command can't!

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.130
I'll ask you one thing:

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.360
can you handle this He Xian or not?

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.480
Two hours.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.170
Please give me two more hours!

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.030
I will...

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.200
I will definitely crack him!

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.230
No. One hour!

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.390
Not a minute more!

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.230
If there's still no progress,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.620
then I'll negotiate with him myself!

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.950
Understood.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.740
Damn it!

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.520
This He Xian...

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.360
Chief,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.490
why don't we just
lay our cards on the table?

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.130
After all, his father and son

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.380
are in our hands.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.810
If we really put guns

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.280
to his father's and son's heads,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.280
I'd like to see how he can stay tough!

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.600
Where exactly are they being held?

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.550
At my Yayue Tea House,

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.890
on Rua da Felicidade.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.020
Yayue Tea House, Rua da Felicidade.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.540
Can you bring them here?

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.580
We can't.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.320
The Portuguese police have that place
completely surrounded.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.470
We can only call

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.630
and let him hear

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.380
the voices of his father and son
over the phone.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.190
No.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.550
Phone calls alone aren't enough
to make a threat stick.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.990
Besides, the phones here

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.650
may already be tapped
by the Portuguese police.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.840
We can't use this move
unless absolutely necessary.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.870
If the call goes on too long,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.080
the Portuguese police might trace the call

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.210
and track us down.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.280
T-Then what should we do now?

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.630
What are you doing, you wretched woman?

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.690
I want to see the police.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.140
I want to see the police!

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.770
I want to see the police!

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.080
What else do you want?

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.250
What do I want?

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.580
What do you want?

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.960
I want to see the police!

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.880
Miss Qiao.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.950
I must say

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.960
we caught you at just the right time.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.850
Do you want to meet someone?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.720
I don't want to see anyone.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.710
I want to see the police.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.520
I want to see the police!

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.780
What if the person you're going to see...

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.720
is Xian?

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.080
Where is he?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.500
What a coincidence.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.240
He's just upstairs.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.170
Surprised?

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.380
I bet

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.780
he's...

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.810
eager to see you too.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.430
I have one request.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.010
Before seeing Xian,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.930
let me freshen up.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.640
By using a woman,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.190
we can make He Xian admit
he's the murderer?

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.340
This woman is no ordinary person.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.630
She's not only
a key anti-Japanese operative

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.750
but also a spy He Xian sent to
Special Operations Team headquarters.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.280
In the past, she caused

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.950
significant losses to our Imperial Army.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.520
And she has an intimate relationship
with He Xian.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.900
He Xian's weakness

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.370
is his need to portray himself as a man
of loyalty and righteousness.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.670
Using Qiao Yinwan against He Xian

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.270
hits the mark perfectly.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.250
No matter what, I just want to remind you,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.820
Colonel Sawa...

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.310
this is your last chance.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.720
Please rest assured.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.840
This time...

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.450
I'll succeed without fail.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.580
Mr. He.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.950
My apologies.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.000
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.820
Where is Consul Imai?

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.600
It's already afternoon,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.200
and he still hasn't woken up?

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.710
He has, he has.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.180
He's finally up.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.690
However,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.950
before you see Consul Imai,

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.390
there's someone here

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.650
I think you might

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:11.830
want to meet first.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.180
Bring her in.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.200
Yinwan?

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.530
-Sawa Eisaku...
-He Xian!

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.030
What exactly do you want?

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.440
Well, that depends on

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.770
what you're going to do, Mr. He.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.050
As long as Consul Imai and I

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.630
can complete our mission,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.740
there's no need

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.190
to continue deploying forces
to blockade Macau.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.350
Everyone will be happy,

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.550
and peace will

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.960
return to the world.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.050
And why must we

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.560
give Miss Qiao, a mere woman,
such a hard time?

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.580
Sawa Eisaku.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.150
Give me some time.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.220
I'll help you persuade him.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.310
Begin.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.340
Xian.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.450
Yinwan.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.860
I'll go find Sawa Eisaku.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.170
All of this is aimed at me.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.390
No matter what,

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.460
I cannot let you suffer any harm.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.680
How important you are to Macau...

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.350
and how much responsibility you carry—

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.600
I think you

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.550
understand that better than I do.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.410
Colonel Sawa,

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.620
didn't you say you'd use this woman

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.150
to force He Xian to confess?

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.320
Now the woman keeps

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.450
telling He Xian not to worry about her.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.330
Isn't that counterproductive?

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.170
Mr. Imai,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.820
please rest assured.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.370
I knew all along that Qiao Yinwan would
try to persuade He Xian like that.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.290
But the more she does that,

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.930
the more guilty He Xian will feel,

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.620
making him more likely to confess.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:02.860
Let's wait and see.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.200
Xian.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.600
Do you remember

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.410
what you said to me

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.790
after my brother died?

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.970
Only great love

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.900
can accomplish a greater cause.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.080
Each of us may have

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.500
attachments and weaknesses in our hearts.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:31.920
Xian.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.980
What you are facing

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.420
is the most vicious

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.580
and cruel enemy in the world—

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.950
the darkest of the dark,
the blackest darkness.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.190
You might have to face

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.790
bonds forged in heartbreak.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.960
I want you to remember this:

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.690
"Only with a selfless heart

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.540
can one be invincible."

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.670
Only with a selfless heart

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.900
can I be invincible?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.780
This woman is really something.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.720
But even if she keeps persuading him
like that,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.770
He Xian won't really disregard
the bigger picture, will he?

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.080
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.410
When she really tries to
take her own life,

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.410
He Xian...

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.270
will definitely crack.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.910
It feels like forever
since we last had a proper conversation.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.670
While we still have time,

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.530
let me play a piece for you.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.840
Still that one, "Auld Lang Syne."

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.560
All right?

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.570
How was it?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.730
That was lovely.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.060
I also want to be like my brother—

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.329
to do my part for Macau

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.869
and for our country.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.110
[Yayue Tea House, Rua da Felicidade]

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.590
Yinwan!

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.930
Yinwan...

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.470
Yinwan!

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.780
Mr. Imai...

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.270
This is...

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:38.610
an accident.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.170
Please believe me.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.600
I'll definitely find another way

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.870
to get He Xian to confess!

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:45.690
Enough!

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.390
You've made promise after promise,
guarantee after guarantee,

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.400
but have you delivered even once?

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.190
And now look what happened.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.270
Your trump card didn't just fail—

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.430
she killed herself.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.160
It almost caused a firefight
between our forces!

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.900
And you still want me to trust you?

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.610
What, do I have to die too

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.280
before you're satisfied?

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:04.610
Mr. Imai...

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.390
-Mr. Imai, I did all this for...
-Say no more!

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.060
I'm the plenipotentiary appointed
by the Imperial government

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.590
and the Command
to handle the Macau Incident!

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.740
I'm now taking over

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.960
all matters related to this incident!

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.850
I'll immediately hold formal talks
with He Xian,

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.870
Macau's negotiating representative!

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:19.480
Mr. Imai!

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.390
Let go of me!

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.260
You wait here!

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.220
You must be Mr. He.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.130
I am the plenipotentiary
for the Macau Incident

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.480
from the Empire of Japan,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.540
the newly appointed Consul to Macau—

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.720
Imai Keiichi.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.580
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.500
The unfortunate incident just now

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.700
was purely an accident.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.030
I personally had no prior knowledge of it.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.490
If it has caused you any distress,

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.580
please accept my apologies.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.110
Mr. He,

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.830
shall we begin the negotiations now?

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.110
Mr. He?

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.220
"Only with a selfless heart

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.980
can one be invincible."

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.330
Consul Imai,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.480
I am He Xian,
the negotiation representative

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.220
from Macau.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.330
Please.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.890
Since Consul Fukue Yasumitsu

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.280
was assassinated,

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.200
the Macau authorities have treated
the matter with the utmost importance.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.000
We have already deployed
sufficient police forces

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.300
and are fully committed to
the investigation,

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.110
striving to solve the case
as soon as possible.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.570
However, in just two days,

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.110
the situation
has continuously deteriorated,

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.740
and conflicts have escalated.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.850
Yet you, as Japan's
plenipotentiary representative,

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:12.760
have, up to this point,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.300
had no direct contact whatsoever

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.960
with the Macau government.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.350
Instead, you've been staying in
this East Asia Hotel

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.200
and have been caught in
a dangerous armed confrontation

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.280
between our sides.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.430
Does all this seem reasonable to you?

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.350
Or could it be that there are people
with ulterior motives behind this,

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.650
deliberately planning,

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.720
stirring up trouble,

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.740
and even using you

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.240
as a hostage or a tool

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.800
to escalate conflicts
and heighten tensions?

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.370
Nonsense!

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:39.410
Mr. Imai.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.650
Please don't listen to his nonsense!

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.410
Consul Imai,

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.160
I am officially negotiating with you

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.160
on behalf of the Macau authorities.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.240
If you still retain any basic respect

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.350
for this negotiation,

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.110
then don't allow irrelevant personnel
to interrupt at will

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.240
and interfere with our negotiations.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.090
Colonel Sawa,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.930
I'm the plenipotentiary representative.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.410
Please mind your place.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.720
Also, speak in Chinese

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.200
as a sign of respect for Mr. He.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.650
I understand.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.760
Mr. He, please continue.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.200
In short,

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.890
Macau has consistently strived

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.020
for a peaceful resolution of disputes
in this conflict.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.060
We have maintained

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.120
the utmost sincerity and restraint.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.170
The Macau military and police forces
outside the East Asia Hotel

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.590
have encircled the area
without launching an attack

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.700
and haven't fired a single shot.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.150
That alone is the best proof.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.110
In light of this,

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.310
on behalf of the Macau government,

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.780
I solemnly request that your side

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.870
immediately lift

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.980
the unreasonable military blockade
of Macau,

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.910
de‑escalate the situation,

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.430
resolve disputes peacefully,

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.030
and severely punish those responsible for
the murder of Mr. Rodrigues and others.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.110
As Japan's plenipotentiary representative,

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.200
I am deeply concerned about

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.430
the rapid deterioration

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:01.500
and escalation of conflicts

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.870
in the Macau Incident.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.130
Given how far the situation has escalated,

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.650
now is not the time to

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.300
look into the reasons behind it

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.780
or assign blame to either side.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.410
After all, if we trace the root cause,

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.170
the origin
of this Japanese-Portuguese conflict

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.910
still lies in the assassination
of Consul Fukue Yasumitsu.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.190
Until the case is solved

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.760
and the perpetrators
are brought to justice,

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.170
the Japanese Imperial Army

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.800
cannot lift
the military blockade of Macau.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:24.710
On this point,

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.290
I must ask for your understanding, Mr. He.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.450
Consul Imai, what you just said

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.850
hits the nail on the head.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.090
We in Macau

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.650
also cannot allow the Fukue case
to remain unresolved.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.200
Mr. He, what do you mean?

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.520
The main purpose

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.960
of my coming here to negotiate

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.410
is to inform you

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.890
that after our relentless efforts,

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.870
the truth behind
Consul Fukue's assassination

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:47.590
is about to

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.560
come to light.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.890
Wasn't it claimed that the Macau police

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.240
had no leads whatsoever?

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.850
That's because you've been deceived
all along

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.450
and never had any direct contact

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.040
with the Macau government or the police.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.700
That's why we haven't had the chance

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.090
to inform you about the progress

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.960
of the case.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:05.370
In fact,

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:07.540
the person who was personally involved

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.560
in the incident and is also a key witness,

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.910
Mr. Asahina Taiki,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.790
has already regained consciousness

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.390
after treatment at the hospital.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.690
Moreover, he has stated

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:19.490
that he possesses conclusive evidence
of the murderer's identity.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.650
Is that so?

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.350
How is it that I

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.910
know nothing about such major news?

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:31.730
Impossible.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.540
He's making this up out of thin air.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.000
Stop talking nonsense!

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.870
Mr. Imai,

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.090
after the incident,

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.060
Yamaguchi never saw Asahina wake up.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.060
Consul Imai,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.360
this isn't Colonel Sawa's fault.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.130
Because Major Yamaguchi
simply doesn't know.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.020
Not just him—

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.390
even the Macau military police

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.260
guarding the hospital
have been kept in the dark.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.410
Why is that?

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.290
And how did you know about it?

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.090
Because the Fukue case itself
is full of suspicious points.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.000
Since the perpetrator's identity
remains a mystery

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.040
and he's still at large,

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.220
we in Macau

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.830
had to implement
the strictest confidentiality measures

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.240
to prevent the real culprit from
acting out of desperation

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.630
and attempting to silence him.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.390
Therefore,

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.480
under Governor De Solaire's direct orders,

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.780
the medical team responsible for treatment

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.110
has maintained strict confidentiality

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.690
regarding Mr. Asahina Taiki's
actual condition.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:20.890
They've announced publicly

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.280
that he never regained consciousness.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.800
And apart from the medical staff,

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.980
Governor De Solaire,

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.380
Inspector General Gonçalves, and myself,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:28.800
you

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.590
and these two gentlemen in this room

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.740
are the only ones who know

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.170
that Mr. Asahina Taiki

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.620
has already regained consciousness.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.270
What did Asahina tell you?

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.100
Who exactly is the perpetrator?

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.050
Unfortunately,

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:43.860
aside from saying that he recognized

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.220
the killer when he first woke up—
before he had

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.010
fully regained consciousness—

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.780
he has refused to say anything else.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.040
Why is that?

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.880
We also found this very strange.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.520
The doctor even suggested that

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.480
if he didn't want to talk to the police,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.280
he could talk to Major Yamaguchi

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.960
or other Japanese officials.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.590
But he was extremely frightened

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.920
and adamantly refused.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.830
Only when he learned

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.910
that you had arrived in Macau

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:07.590
did he say he would

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.960
tell the truth about the whole matter,

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.090
but only if he could meet you in person.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.560
So you mean

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.890
I must go to the hospital
to see him myself?

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.460
Yes.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.320
Mr. Imai, you absolutely cannot go.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.680
Once you leave here,

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.590
your safety cannot be guaranteed.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.790
The murder of Consul Fukue is a warning.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.920
Don't fall into the killer's trap.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.000
Now I finally understand,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.150
Consul Imai,

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.170
why you've been staying in
this East Asia Hotel

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.930
and avoiding any direct contact

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.950
with the Macau government.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:36.590
Consul Imai,

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.090
if the Macau authorities

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.050
truly intended to harm you,

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.040
would all those police troops outside—

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.040
all those machine guns, cannons,
and armored vehicles—

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.370
remain silent

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.970
for an entire day
without firing a single shot?

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:49.700
Mr. Imai,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.560
that's just because they fear
the Imperial Army...

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.890
Mr. He,

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.590
please continue.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:01.950
When I came here,

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.720
Governor De Solaire personally asked me
to tell you

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.220
that he's been waiting outside
the hotel for you.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.910
If you decide to visit the hospital,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.600
he will be
personally accompanying you throughout.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.200
Wouldn't that reassure you?

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.590
Mr. He, I've decided.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.120
I'll go to the hospital now.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.200
Consul Imai, please.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.370
Wait!

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.970
Mr. Imai, please wait a moment.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.370
Leaving here will put you at risk.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:32.880
Therefore,

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.600
please allow me to arrange

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.550
personal security for you.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.380

will accompany you personally.

So,

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.620
Mr. He should remain here.

This

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.060
seems more prudent.

Mr. He, are you willing to stay behind?

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.400
Very well.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.090

Are you sure

that was a liquid diet for the patient?

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.640
It looked and tasted like it.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:44.810
In any case,

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.670
it definitely wouldn't be
a doctor's lunch.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.670
My guess is they quietly brought it in,

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.420
fed it to him,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.370

that Asahina
hadn't regained consciousness,

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.500
they were deliberately covering it up?

I can't be certain about that.

sedatives to his food

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.090
so that he can sleep peacefully.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:56.690
Just now, after we received notice
that you, the Governor of Macau

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.950
and the Japanese Consul, would be coming
to ask him questions,

00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:59.890
I administered some medication

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.260
to help him

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.720
wake up.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.610
But it takes 20 minutes for the medication

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:05.470
to take effect.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.400
After that, you can question him.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.540
I see.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.380
How about this—

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.980
before the patient wakes up,

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.840
why don't you all wait in my office?

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.480
I can also give you
a detailed explanation about

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.250

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.650
and treatment progress.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.159

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.159
what do you think?

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:23.790
Alright.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.159
Let's wait in the office then.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:26.750
Okay.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:27.739

Major Yamaguchi,

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.080
we still need to protect Consul Imai.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.210
I'll be responsible

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.870
for protecting Consul Imai.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.080
There are too many people coming
and going in this ward area.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.710
What if

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.000
something happens to Consul Imai
when he comes back later?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.800
Don't forget,

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.850
the culprit who killed Consul Fukue
is still at large.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.480

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.420

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.440
take them

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.600

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.210
all rooms in this area

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.250
to eliminate any potential security risks.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.480
But our assignment is to guard the ward.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.440
Consul Fukue

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.270
was just killed in Macau.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.850
If anything happens to
Consul Imai as well,

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:21.850
can you take responsibility for that?

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:22.980
Start immediately.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.410
No choice then.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.450
You take upstairs,

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.850
and I'll take this floor.

The specific situation is...

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.260
Asahina Taiki was severely injured

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.820
and remains in critical condition.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.730
In fact,

he hasn't even woken up yet.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:28.430

How dare you tell such an enormous lie?

Governor De Solaire,

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.950
is this how you treat me,

of the Empire of Japan?

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.550

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.290
no need to waste words with them.

Consul Imai.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.600
What was your purpose
for coming to the hospital?

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.730
Wasn't it to find out who killed Fukue?

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.950
But Asahina hasn't woken up at all.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.790
Who am I supposed to ask?

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.190
Asahina hasn't woken up.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:24.160
But he's still telling us
who the killer is right now.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:50.850
Fearless Biao.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.830
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.700

was the real culprit...
