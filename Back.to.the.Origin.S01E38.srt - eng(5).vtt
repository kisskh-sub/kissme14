How's it going with the form?

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.440
Getting there.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.280
Drinks tonight?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.040
Can't drink much.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.240
Drink at your own pace.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.919
Sure.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.080

You bet!

Ready whenever.

Not now though.

That's a clear foul, man...

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.040
Went for the legs...

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.360
Talking back to the ref?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.440
Should be off the field...

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.160
Oh, man...

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.600

Sweet shot...

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.560
Pathetic!

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.560
You suck,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.360
just quit already.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:48.640
Mr. Li,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.240
Thanks.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.960
I'll get back to work then.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.000
Sure, thanks.

Bravo!

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.040
Second toast

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.520

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.720
He made a brilliant

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.200

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.400
Just like him,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.000

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.520
but smart.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.320
If he knew office politics,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.600

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.920
Wait up!

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.560
Mr. Li,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.600

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.920
Have a real drink!

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.280
Well, actually...

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.680
my gums are acting up.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.600
On antibiotics,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600
can't drink...

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.159
Better see a doctor!

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:38.800
Well folks,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.680
drink up if you can!

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080
Rest of you, do as you please!

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.000
Cheers!

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.360
Drink up!

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.320

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.000
Mr. Wang, to you!

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.360

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.320
Real mess...

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.880

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:26.880
Hey, hon!

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.000
Bath's almost ready.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.400
Why do you have

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.920
this jerk on your Wechat?

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.400
What are you

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.240
talking about?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.000
Look.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:37.600
Let me see...

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.000
When did this happen?

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.159
Just at your

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.360
company event

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:42.919
last time.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.799
You shouldn't

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.640
be liking his post!

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.520
Gosh!

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.880
That bastard

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.760
stabbed me in the back!

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.040
I devoted myself

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.320
to that Singles' Day

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.400
marketing plan

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.680
and he swooped in

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.440
and stole it.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.600
Made it look like

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.440
his idea!

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.200
How could you...

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.960
what a betrayal!

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.800
Hold on,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.200
let me explain.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.520
Listen,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.040
just because I liked

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.400
his post

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.320
doesn't make

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.440
us buddies!

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.320
What does it make you?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.520
Just workplace diplomacy!

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.840
Gotta play nice

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.080
sometimes.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.440
Keep things smooth

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.400
on the surface,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.120
right?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.920
Plenty of people like him.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.200
Sometimes

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.600
you gotta

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.760
put your pride aside,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.400
y'know?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.400

taking over our team?

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.840
No clue.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.400
Hey Peter,

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.440
a quick question

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.400
I've been

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.280
wondering about...

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.840
Just curious...

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.280
Em,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.360
when you

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.320
make your,

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.960
er,

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.280
like,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.000
instant noodles here...

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Do you throw in

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.600
pothos leaves?

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.160
Never.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.400
Good,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.160
that's public property.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.200
Hey,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.440
watching videos?

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.800
Should turn you in!

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.200
Mr. Qiu,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.520
Li Daoqi here.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.880
About the interview

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.000
last week...

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.640
Yeah,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.480
the pay is a bit

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.360
lower than

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.360
I expected,

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:34.960
but

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.200
I've been thinking...

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.160
Got it.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.040
Thanks anyway...

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.400
OK.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.800
Yeah, sure.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.480
OK then.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.920
Bye.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:47.800
Here.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.360
Been looking for work all week,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.240
no luck.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.160
If the

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.640
collaboration with Lady Wan

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.440
had worn out then...

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.040
I wouldn't be

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.600
stuck here feeling miserable.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.160
Should've

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.920
stood my ground with Mr. Wang.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.720
Let a career-changing chance

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.560
slip away.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.680
Take it easy.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.120
Job market's tough,

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.080
give it time.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.480
Give it time?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.520
It's been forever!

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.680
Been doing tons of exercise,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.280
I'm turning into

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.600
a fitness guru!

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.800
That's not so bad.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.160
Like what I said,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.360
our passive income

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.040
covers

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.160
our expenses

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160
just fine.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.600
With both properties,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.360
this one and your rental,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.760
we're set.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:35.720
Nian's

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.200
future is

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.560
secure too.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.200
Honestly,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.520
having you home

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.520
with me

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.440
and Nian

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.160
has been great.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.600
Even Nian

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.800
seems happier.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.200
Seriously,

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.080
just retire with me!

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:03.960
Hey,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.720
I'm only 38!

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.480
What the heck is it?

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.200
Avocado yogurt.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.200
Doesn't even

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.200
sound edible.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.120
But how is it?

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.120
Not bad.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:19.880
Have more.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.120
So, this is my

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.160
retirement diet with you?

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.800
I'll make anything you like.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.440
[Mr. Li,]

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:29.920
[the security deposit]

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.760
[for the contract with Lady Wan]

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.880
[is ready.]

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.720
[But a heads-up,]

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.080
[such a large]

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.840
[personal loan]

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.720
[is very risky.]

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:38.920
Don't worry,

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.840
I've taken precautions.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.800
Won't affect my family.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.240
Gotta

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.600
grab this opportunity.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.400
[Alright, Mr. Li.]

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.040
OK.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.480
And tell sales department to

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.640
draft

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.040
next month's plan.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.720
Mr. Li!

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.600
Hi everyone...

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.000
Good, good...

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.440
Look!

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.920
Here comes our superstar!

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.400
Nah, you're the real star.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.160
Look around!

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200
How's the setup?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.680
Splendid!

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.520
All for our two stars,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.520
you and Yudong!

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:37.600
Mr. Li!

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.320
Thanks!

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.200
Congrats!

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.640
Thanks!

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.160
What an

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:41.880
incredible business

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.280
vision!

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.280
I need to learn from you!

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.600
I'm flattered.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.560
Gotta translate

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.080
our chats

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.600
when I'm back,

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.000
afraid

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.120
I missed

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:48.920
any stuff.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.360
I'll stop mixing languages!

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.560
Just joking!

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.040
Mr. Fu!

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.680
Yudong!

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.200
Come here!

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.080
What's wrong?

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.040
Bad sleep?

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.960
Nervous

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.240
or excited?

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.400
Don't worry so much!

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:05.840
Just

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.200
stayed up late working.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.000
No worries.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.640
I'll be fine soon.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.360
Poor thing!

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.560
Listen.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.400
Yeah?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.680
You two are

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.880
my lucky stars

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.320
and my champions!

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.560
Gotta take care

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.320
of yourselves, OK?

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.800
Picking

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.240
you two

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.760
was a

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.760
genius move!

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.600
Heaven's on my side!

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.760
Look!

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.560
Congratulations on first victory,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.520
sales exceeding X0 million!

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.040
We'll

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.240
definitely hit

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.080
10 million!

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.080
But which number,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.360
one through nine,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.760
that's for you

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.000
to decide!

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.320
It's Mr. Xing's smart idea,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.440
and I kept it for now!

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.200
What if we hit 100 million?

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.080
Now that's

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.760
the spirit!

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.560
Right on!

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.120
Now that's our Dr. Fu!

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.520
Ah...

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.800
should probably

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.720
grab a fork...

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:16.920
Or...

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.480
Here, Mr. Li.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.160
Alright,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.720
thank you.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.160
No problem.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.120
Not gonna lie,

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.440
you've got that

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.960
classic

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.840
Hong Kong TV star

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.320
vibe going on.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.160
With your looks,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.200
you should try

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.200
showbiz!

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.800
Still hung up on Zhang Ran?

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.600
Look around.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.160
See

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:58.600
all this?

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.680
Know what this means?

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.880
To the victor go the spoils!

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.319
I've been reading

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.119
some

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.560
biographies,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.079
and made a conclusion.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.480
What's that?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.880
Problems that

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:24.599
come with growth

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.800
can only be fixed through

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.200
further growth.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:29.960
Sure, philosopher.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.840
You can't keep up

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.880
with my thinking now.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.200
Winners write history.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.400
All these problems

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.680
we're facing?

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.960
Once we make it,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.600
they'll all disappear.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:49.880
See?

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.600
We agreed though,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.600
no more

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.480
fake wife marketing

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.600
after this.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.360
Deal!

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.520
This is my last live.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.120
Sure,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.520
last time.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.240
I promise.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.600
Deal?

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.840
Ouch, nearly snapped it!

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.560
You broke

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.320
this one,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.760
remember?

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.520
Why'd you stop?

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.160
Not feeling good?

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.040
Tell me.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.840
Daddy's busy these days,

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.640
Once he's done,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.560
he'll be back

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.640
to be with you.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.600
Nian,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.480
are you mad at daddy?

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.400
I know,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.680
and I'm mad too.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.840
But

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.080
he's starting a company,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.160
and it's tough.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.640
The company has

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.720
lots of workers,

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.920
and they all have

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.440
little ones

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.040
like you.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.640
Daddy needs to

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.080
be responsible for them,

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.800
so

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.200
he's very busy now.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.560
Nian,

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.720
remember when

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.560
we went climbing

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.280
last year?

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.880
You were

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.840
wonderful that day,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.200
walking all by yourself.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.920
But

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.480
climbing was really hard.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.360
I remember

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.120
halfway up,

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.160
we both said,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.480
"We're too tired,

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.640
maybe we should head back."

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.280
Remember what daddy

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.360
said back then?

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.000
Don't give up!

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.840
Yes! He said to hang in there,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.920
just a bit more.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.440
Once past the trees,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.600
we'd reach the top.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.400
But I

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.880
didn't believe him.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.120
He even offered

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.560
to carry both of us!

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.680
Said,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.760
"We've come this far,

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.360
why

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.880
quit now?"

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.360
Right?

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:37.920
He held you in one arm,

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.440
pulled me with the other,

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.080
and the three of us

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.200
just kept going.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.760
About ten minutes later,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.600
we made it to the top!

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.840
Remember?

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.480
That's why

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.720
daddy's so remarkable.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.880
That's called determination.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.160
Know what that means?

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.080
When we

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.600
decide on a goal,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.480
we have to finish it,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.000
and can't quit halfway.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.000
Double-check all

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.120
our stock.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.400
No room for errors.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:10.680
Yes.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.320
Tell Alex,

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.680

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.440
Yes, Mr. Li.

Switch out all secondary products.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.720
Keep only current bestsellers.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.400

That's the gist.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.280
When Lady Wan signals,

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.000

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:34.440

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.800
What are you doing?

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.720
[Did you hear what I said?]

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.000
[Li Daoqi, listen,]

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.840
[all losses are]

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.080
[on you!]

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.240
[These debts are yours!]

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.480
[Don't try running,]

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.640
[I'll definitely hunt you down!]

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:51.600
[Hey?]

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.280
[Hey?]

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.040
We'll handle

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.840
this, Lady Wan.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.280
OK, I will

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:14.880
reach out.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.000
I'm begging you to help me.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.680
Step in for Lady Wan,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.840
Do a live

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.920
for our products.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.960
Help us get through this.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.720
I've considered

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.040
every option,

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.520
yeah...

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.480
In the end,

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.560
I need your help.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.480
Even just two days,

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.560
or one day!

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.080
OK.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.720
Hello? Hello?

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.320
Mr. Li!

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.520
What is it?

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.560
Good timing,

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.560
wanna be a goalkeeper?

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.200
I...

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.520
Your wife says she can't

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.320
reach your cell,

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.960
and she's on the office line now.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.880
Should I connect her?

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.440
Put her through.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.200
Right away.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:34.760
Hello hon,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.720
what's the matter?

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.040
I couldn't reach you

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:38.920
on your cell.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.600
Did you see the news?

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.200
Yeah, I did.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.040
[Don't panic, OK?]

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.720
There's always a way

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.080
to solve issues.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.440
If you need any help,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.640
just let me know, OK?

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.680
It's fine, really.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:28:59.800
Don't worry.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800
I'm handling

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.560
it well.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:04.640
So...

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.920
what did the investors say?

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.320
What else can we do?

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.760
When storms come,

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.480
can we argue with the sky?

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.880
Look,

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.320
this is an unexpected event.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.720
It's not really

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.600
your fault.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.480
Don't worry about me.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.160
Like what I

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.160
always say,

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.600
what seems

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.000
[devastating now]

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.160
will just be a funny story later on.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.480
Yeah,

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.800
that's so true.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.000
Makes me feel better.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.040
But

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.400
if something bothers you,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.720
don't keep it in.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.040
[Talk to me, OK?]

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.880
I'm fine, really.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.600
I'm actually worried about Yudong.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.720
I dragged him into this,

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.000
so I feel pretty guilty.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.320
[He's been completely]

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.240
[worn out from all this.]

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.600
[He was]

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.680
[all dressed up like a groom.]

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.720
[Don't know how to comfort him.]

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.120
Don't worry.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.240
I'll be home late.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.160
Need to grab a drink

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.440
with him.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.320
Is Nian in bed?

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.160
[Yeah...]

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.560
Easy on the drinks.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.880
I'll wait for you.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.280
Good night.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.520
Bye!

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.160
Mommy!

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.960
Nian, why are you up?

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.280
Where's daddy?

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.960
Daddy will be home soon.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.280
Back to bed,

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.400
c'mon.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.400
Daddy'll be back soon.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.600
Come on, sweetie.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:28.960
Ran,

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:30.960
Ran...

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.080
They're getting antsy...

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.280
Alright.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:46.960
What's the deal?

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.200
Can't speed things up?

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.800
Are we still doing it?

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:50.680
Yeah,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.600
just three more minutes.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.320
Zhang Ran, I'm coming in.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.880
You were killing it.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.360
Everyone thought so.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320
Don't you

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.200
trust us?

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.440
Who let that toad in?

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.240
Life just

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.760
pushes us along.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:38.880
Accept it.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.080
Once we wrap,

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.560
let's grab a drink.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:57.960
She's good?

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.240
Two minutes.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.560
Mr. Wang,

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.040
true, her price

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.320
is high.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.760
But think about it,

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.440
once this show drops,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.320
these numbers won't even be

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.760
in the picture anymore.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.000
[Mr. Lin,]

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.400
[when will you be back?]

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.560
[There's too much going on.]

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.240
[I'm drowning here.]

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.600
What's happening?

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.160
[Right now,]

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.400
[of more than 50 mid-level streamers,]

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.240
[40 want out.]

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.600
[No pay since]

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.320
[last month.]

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.000
[They've been after me many times...]

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.680
[Someone from the property management came,]

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.080
[saying we haven't paid rent]

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:08.880
[since last quarter.]

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.560
[Now they won't lease to us.]

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.160
[They want two floors cleared]

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.760
[and ask us to move now.]

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.800
Alright, understood.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.920
Once we finish shooting,

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.720
everything will get resolved.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.160
[Landlord is]

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.320
[seriously pushing!]

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.840
[And the streamers,]

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.840
[the good ones]

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.520
[are all leaving.]

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.160
[Nothing I say makes a difference!]

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.440
Listen to me.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.960
Take a deep breath.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.520
Everything is under control.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.080
[Please come back now!]

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.560
Y'know, this mess...

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.040
Mr. Lin.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.440
What's the matter?

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:43.960
Just a few days left.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.040
I'm done.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.720
Tell the production whatever,

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.000
health problems,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.040
family emergency,

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:49.400
anything.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.440
I'm leaving now.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.200
Zhang Ran,

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.720
have you lost it?

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.680
We're almost done!

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.600
Hang in there!

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.360
No way!

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.560
I can't stand it!

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:04.880
I've been played!

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.680
You knew they were

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.440
planning a couple storyline.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.880
But you didn't tell me, right?

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.400
Lin Chang,

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:11.680
you're

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.000
utterly

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.920
despicable!

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.600
Did you steal from her?

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.640
Yeah sure,

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.720
you'd be my first target!

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.480
Despicable how?

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.400
I just found out myself!

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.440
It doesn't matter

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.400
anymore.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.760
I'm done being

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.360
manipulated by you,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:27.840
OK?

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.880
Let me go!

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.440
Hey,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.480
when did I ever

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.160
manipulate

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:31.600
you?

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.400
Every single moment.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.440
When did I

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:34.800
do

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:34.920
that?

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.920
Every moment.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.320
You wanted fame,

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.800
and haven't I been helping you

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.200
achieve that?

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.000
That was for my sake?

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.320
No,

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.040
you did it for yourself,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:48.960
not for me!

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.360
You said that

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.400
once I become famous,

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.320
Zhang Ran wouldn't

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.480
belong to me anymore.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040
Well,

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:56.920
I've realized now,

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.720
Zhang Ran only belongs to me.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.280
I call my

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.520
own shots!

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.240
Getting here,

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.080
I've lost

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.000
so, so much!

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.920
Way more than what I've gained!

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.560
It's gotta stop right now!

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.560
Am I clear?

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.360
You signed the contract!

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.400
You signed it for Tide Media!

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.520
Just a contract.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.120
I'll compensate

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.120
whatever I need to.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.880
Can't film today,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.320
I'll face my consequence.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.600
I'll go to jail,

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.120
if I must!

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.240
I've made peace with it.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.600
Can't have everything, right?

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.840
I hope you'll

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.080
stop trying to have it all!

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:35.800
Hey...

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.440
I'm leaving!

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.000
You lost your mind!

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.720
No, I haven't.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.280
I...

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.760
Between us, who...

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:40.640
Zhang Ran...

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.280
Cut it out.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.040
I know

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.440
you're upset.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.160
I'm not upset,

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.960
seriously.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:45.800
Get the camera.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:46.520
[I know...]

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.040
Film Zhang Ran.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.040
[You're against...]

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:48.680
Cameraman!

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.000
[This idea.]

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.800
[I get it.]

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.840
Lin Chang, that's not

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.720
even the point!

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.760
I know you're hurt.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.640
Don't cry,

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.720
please!

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.640
How about...

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.360
we form the couple?

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.760
You and I...

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.960
I'll talk to the director.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.760
Stop this madness.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.360
I'm not mad.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.560
Stop, stop!

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.640
You and I...

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.360
Let go.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.760
I passed the audition.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.400
Hey...

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:09.880
Lin Chang,

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.080
snap out of it!

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.600
Zhang Ran...

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.720
slap me, c'mon!

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.520
It'll make us famous!

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.200
C'mon, do it!

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:26.960
Slap me, slap me!

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.640
You're not

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.440
in your right mind,

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:28.840
y'know?

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.560
Slap me

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.440
and save the company!

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.120
Do it!

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.720
C'mon, do it!

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.200
Follow them!

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:33.800
Zhang Ran, Zhang Ran,

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.720
this is our chance!

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.840
Zhang Ran, Zhang Ran,

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.040
our chance!

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.480
Hello,

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.400
police?

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.400
You must have the wrong number.
