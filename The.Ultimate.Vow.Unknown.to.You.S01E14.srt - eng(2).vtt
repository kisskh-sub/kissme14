00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020
(Yuwen Que)

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.900
(Isn't that low woman
the one you cherish most?)

00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:22.377
(Tonight,)

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.699
(I will make her witness it herself.)

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.419
(I will make you mine, completely.)

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.380
Your Highness.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.258
All my life,

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.940
I have always gotten what I wanted.

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:39.699
The only thing I could never have
was your heart.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.979
Finally you are mine tonight.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.380
(He hurt me beyond measure.)

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.579
(Then why, seeing him like this, do I...)

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.260
Shen Qingru.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.940
Isn't she the one you hate most?

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.260
Look.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.380
Take a look at the one you care about

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.070
so deeply now.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.739
Ru.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.660
What did you say?

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.057
I am sorry.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.540
Ru.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.739
I am sorry.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:55.540
That cannot be.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:56.818
You clearly...

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:57.418
Ru.

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.714
You were already...

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.340
I came too late.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.540
Your Highness.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.499
I will do anything for you.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.179
Let me stay and attend to you.

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.100
No.

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.019
You are not Ru.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:19.299
Her hands

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.139
would never shake like this.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.220
What makes that woman so worthy?

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.378
She is nothing but a lowly...

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:27.299
Enough.

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.260
You are not even fit to speak her name.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.139
How am I inferior to her?

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:37.435
I was born to nobility.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:40.271
Music, chess, calligraphy,
and painting, I master them all.

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:43.899
My devotion to you
is known throughout the Imperial City.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.520
Exactly so.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.340
Every glance and every smile of yours

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.220
is nothing but calculation.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.419
And she,

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:57.739
even her hatred

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.660
is truer than your love.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.260
You are insane.

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.859
For a woman who hates you...

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:16.220
Get out!

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.620
(Yuwen Que.)

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.740
(Your end has come.)

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.539
Ru.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:44.940
Is that you?

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.099
I am sorry.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.139

It broke.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.099
Good that it broke.

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:15.940
Today at the market,

00:07:16.062 --> 00:07:17.442
I saw this hairpin.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.820
Under the moonlight,

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:21.139
it looked just like your eyes.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.019
You always know how to make me smile.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.899
Put it on for me.

00:07:29.412 --> 00:07:30.380
That hurts.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.459
I am sorry.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.139
Let me try again.

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:36.378
You cannot even put on a hairpin.

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:37.579
Then teach me.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.720
I want to learn how to care
for everything about you.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.339
All right. I will teach you.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.300
Good that it broke.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.300
Just like those memories.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.339
All shattered.

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:33.659
Broken cleanly and completely.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.420
That way,

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:38.219
I will not have to remember anymore

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.299
how good you once were to me.

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:51.260
Ru.

00:08:52.819 --> 00:08:54.098
Dawn is coming.

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:55.139
Stay.

00:08:56.862 --> 00:08:58.100
I am begging you.

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:03.380
Have you ever seen

00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:04.715
the sun

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.899
and the moon

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.419
share the same sky?

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.100
If it were for you,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.620
I would let the sun never rise.

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:20.220
But the sky

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.860
will always grow light in the end.

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:27.620
The hatred between us

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.260
cannot be undone
by a single night of warmth.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.179
Ru, I know
you still have feelings for me.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.059
Do not touch me.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.659
Once day breaks,

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.299
I will no longer be your Ru.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.980
And you will no longer be my Che.

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:43.500
I am Shen Qingru,
the one who will kill you.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.460
And you are the enemy
who slaughtered my entire family.

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:48.059
Then kill me.

00:09:48.459 --> 00:09:50.580
Here and now.

00:09:52.499 --> 00:09:54.659
Do you know what I hate most about you?

00:09:54.819 --> 00:09:55.740
What?

00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:57.380
Your hypocrisy.

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:07.100
Ru.

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:08.580
I can...

00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:11.860
What?

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.580
Keep deceiving me?

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.700
Or

00:10:16.219 --> 00:10:18.139
are you finally going to tell me

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.019
why you killed my entire family?

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.419
Leave.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.700
Go.

00:11:14.819 --> 00:11:16.460
Shen Qingru.

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:20.019
I want you dead.
