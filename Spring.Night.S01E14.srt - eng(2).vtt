(Tomb of Beloved Daughter Mai Xiang)

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.120
Who did it?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.120
The neighbors said earlier

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.240
there was a carriage

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.880
marked with "Qiu" at the gate.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.840
That's the Prime Minister's.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.520
The Prime Minister.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.280
While studying for the exams,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.760
I heard of the power plays

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.720
at court.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.240
Prime Minister Qiu
has dominated for over 20 years.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.320
It's said that half the realm

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.640
answers to him.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.080
That's why he dares to act

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.520
so brazenly in murder.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.920
Father.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.520
Ye Wuming.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.440
Listen carefully.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.680
Mai Tian is my only daughter left.

00:03:01.888 --> 00:03:03.320
Keep her safe.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.000
Father.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.720
Was the Prime Minister

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.920
targeting me?

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.840
I brought disaster upon my sister.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.040
Mai Xiang died in my place.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.800
Everything is my fault.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.120
Mai Tian.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.200
Don't worry.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.800
I'll uncover the truth.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.320
Mai Xiang won't die in vain.

(Tomb of Beloved Daughter Mai Xiang)

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.800
I have a gift for you.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.400
What did you do to her?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.200
Relax.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.800
I haven't touched her.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.520
How did you find out?

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.920
When my own man

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.080
develops divided loyalties,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.320
I investigate thoroughly.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.720
I never imagined

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.440
the orphan I saved years ago

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.200
was a Shen family remnant.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.160
Relax.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.240
My father remains unaware.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.440
But...

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.200
he ordered me to eliminate

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.480
this child's true father.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.720
How would you like to die?

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.680
Look.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.800
Only I can save you.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.720
Behave from now on.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.120
Go finish

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.920
the unfinished task.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.920
Ye Wuming!

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.960
Su Chun!

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.160
Hurry!

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.240
Get them out here!

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.920
Come quickly!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.040
The provincial exam results!

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.720
The results are out?

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.640
Mr. Su,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640
you passed the exam.

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:29.093
(Rankings)

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.960
What?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.720
I really passed.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.560
Congratulations.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.280
Mr. Su passed!

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.760
What about me?

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.240
I'll check for you.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.240
Let's look together.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200
I'll find yours.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.560
Hurry up!

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.640
Well?

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.840
Stop dragging it out.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.400
Did I pass?

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.360
Just tell me.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.520
Am I on the list?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.200
Well,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.720
after all this time

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720
living together,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.560
I never knew

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.600
you had such talent.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.640
Admit it.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.840
You've been studying
secretly, haven't you?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.120
You took first place!

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.240
I truly didn't expect

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.120
to rank first.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.400
I botched one question.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.040
I shouldn't have gotten top honors.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.200
In a few days,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.240
we'll head to the capital together.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.840
Once we

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.440
earn our places on the final list,

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:31.600
we'll stand as one

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.920
for the nation.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.400
For the people.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.000
I own a private house in the capital.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.560
Aren't you taking the exams?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.560
Stay at my place.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.240
Why should I?

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.120
Suit yourself.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.040
(Ye Wuming.)

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.520
(Jieyuan is merely your first step.)

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.320
(I must get you to the palace exam)

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.440
(to stand before the Emperor.)

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.040
Wuming.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.400
It's okay.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.400
Grab our luggage later.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.080
No.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.960
(Capital Map)
I... I can't understand this map.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.600
Take a look.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600
Do you know the way?

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.360
This way.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.840
Wuming.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.040
Did you come here

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.000
for the exams before?

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.360
No.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.160
Why?

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.760
Then how did you know the way?

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.320
Instinct.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.360
Well...

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.840
You navigate by instinct?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.000
The place Mr. Qiu prepared for us

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is actually quite nice.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.800
It's passable.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.000
Are these

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.480
the new clothes you got for us?

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800
I've heard

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.400
the plum wine from the tavern next door

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.240
is especially good.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.040
I'll go buy some to cheer up.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.840
What is it?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.920
I want to talk to you.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.720
I don't want to talk.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.440
Well then,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.440
want a beating?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.960
Being under the Prime Minister
for so long,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.240
you only know violence.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.040
With that,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.360
people listen.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.600
Then let me remind you.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.080
Even if you use violence,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.160
you can't ignore your conscience.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.040
I won't waste time arguing with you.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.720
Just know this.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.440
Protect Mai Tian well.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.840
Otherwise,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.160
I will take your life.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.040
From the sound of it,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.800
you want to test my skills.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.240
I'll oblige.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.360
Bring it on.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.840
How about we find another spot

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.240
to settle this?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.000
You're not late after all.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.040
Miss Qiu.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.640
What do you need?

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.440
I feel like killing someone.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.960
Also,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.840
I need a double

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.400
for my child's father.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.400

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.560
from over there.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.560
Kill him.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.640
Let him die in your place.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.840
Tell me,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.440
isn't that perfect?

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.160
One.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:14.920
Two.
