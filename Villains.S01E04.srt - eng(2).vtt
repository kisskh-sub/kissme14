00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.947
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:42.936
Boss, here's your phone.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.441
Clean this place up

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.528
then call the cops.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.238
Oh, right.

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.533
The NIS raided our gambling joint.
Those sons of bitches.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.243
When?

00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.744
Just now. Those bastards.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.079
Why are you telling me now?

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.290
You useless piece of shit.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.375
Damn it.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.225
Freeze!

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.272
Step aside.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.149
Move aside!

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.872
Pack everything up
and shut down the factory for now.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:44.956
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:47.792
It's a Level One air-raid warning.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:50.253
Let's move quickly and accurately,
just as we trained.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:00.597
I am

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.766
the owner of this business
who got attacked by the robbers.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.312
You have a system that monitors
the illegal gambling joint.

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:08.771
The one upstairs?

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:12.483
That's also my business.
Everything's all connected.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.069
Man, these assholes.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.579
Call for backup

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.206
and secure any and all evidence.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.457
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.417
Yes.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.127
Make the request quickly.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:59.239
EPISODE 4: OPERATION;
THE 500 BILLION DISTRIBUTION PLAN

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.449
- What's wrong with you?
- Be quiet.

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:03.076
I own this business!

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.036
Man, what the fuck?

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.815
I always turn off

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.775
nearby surveillance cameras
during live fights.

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:38.194
What do we do?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.906
What do you think?

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:45.827
Turn yourself in.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.870
You put me up for it.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.123
So?

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.083
You want to drag me into this?

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.794
You know I'm up for a promotion.

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:58.756
I'm asking you to pull some strings
with your connections and help me.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:00.758
My connections?

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:03.219
Who are my connections?

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.638
Well, I wouldn't know.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.849
But others say they're as powerful...

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.602
Listen to this punk.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.522
You've become quite a talker,
haven't you?

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.232
You're almost finished.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.734
I'm sorry.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.279
I'll let you get off
with six months of probation.

00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.656
So turn yourself in
to Internal Affairs.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.659
What's wrong?

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:28.202
Is that not good enough?

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.788
No, sir. I appreciate your help.

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:38.129
- That's more like it. Right?
- Yes, sir.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.048
You punk.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.859
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.532
Please speak.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.328
I had no idea
Han Soo-hyun knew about that place.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.122
I kept trying to reach you.

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:16.250
What?

00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:17.835
Yes.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.462
I understand.

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:43.236
Let's get started.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.405
I need to eat my food too.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:46.697
We might have to spend the night up.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.324
So come on, eat up.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.701
How far did I get
during the testimony yesterday?

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.745
Forget it. I'm done!

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.164
I'm just saying, we should eat first.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.083
Why are you so extreme?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.043
Hey, take everything away.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.628
Is now really the time
for a hamburger?

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.802
You said J went
to Jang Joong-hyuk's hideout

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:09.887
and gave him a business proposal.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:15.893
Now, what's next?

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.483
3 MONTHS AGO

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.298
Have you been well?

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.308
I said I'd come back for you.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.903
Darn it.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:10.490
I almost lost my precious database.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.081
I heard you were back in the game.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.209
Jeez, how long has it been?

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.170
Five years?

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:25.838
Drop three years from that.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.008
I had to rot in the pen
for three years because of you.

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.344
I hear you're laundering money.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.513
It doesn't sound like you'll need me.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:34.931
Why are you here?

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.265
Did you miss me?

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.980
You're going around
dropping something like this.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.233
Why wouldn't I want to see you?

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:50.488
When did you master
counterfeiting the Hong Kong dollar?

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.242
So?

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:56.702
Why don't you join me
for one serious job?

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:57.912
"Serious"?

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:00.414
What do you mean by that?

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.502
That this time,
you won't stab me in the back?

00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:07.672
Do you mean
that you won't kill anyone?

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:09.340
What?

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.267
- It wasn't me.
- No?

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.893
The warehouse explosion.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.229
That wasn't you?

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:28.109
Man, this is just...

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:33.030
What will it take
for you to accept my offer this time?

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:35.783
Would you join me if I said...

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.662
I was behind
what happened five years ago?

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:42.331
Then I'll admit it.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.958
I'll do that 100 times,
even 1,000 times.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.043
As many times as you want.

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:49.297
Don't think you can
talk your way out of this.

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.340
Be honest.

00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:53.801
Tell the truth.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.595
The truth?

00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:58.055
Then will you believe me?

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.391
If you tell the truth.

00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:05.062
It wasn't me.

00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.236
How brazen are you?

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:15.865
You came to find me,
as if nothing had happened

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:18.075
after that horrendous thing you did

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:20.369
just to offer me another job?

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.495
You know what?

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:23.664
If you join me this time

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.584
- we can fix that misunderstanding.
- Don't be ridiculous.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.760
I've left your portion in the bank
to earn interest over five years.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.387
In today's world of Bitcoins
and NFT projects

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.015
real currencies are disappearing

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:45.269
and even counterfeiting
will soon disappear into the past.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.479
Your technique

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.939
will fade into memory.

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.776
Let's do it right, one last time

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:54.612
using the counterfeit bill of dreams

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:56.614
supernote.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:10:59.700
Soo-hyun.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.541
Come find me tomorrow.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.502
Okay?

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.354
You didn't even
recognize your partner.

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:30.439
If that hit me, I'd be a goner.

00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:33.984
Why didn't you tell me beforehand
that J was going to be here?

00:11:34.985 --> 00:11:36.696
I couldn't find time to reach out.

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:38.132
Is Yeon working with Soo-hyun?

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.426
Oh, that little kid.

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:42.428
Of course, she's with Soo-hyun.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.806
That girl, Yeon.

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:50.352
I always knew she was a good hacker

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:54.315
but I didn't know she was good enough
to hack crypto wallets.

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:58.152
We need her skills
for this plan to work

00:12:58.235 --> 00:12:59.695
so make sure she comes tomorrow.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:00.821
Come on.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.490
Don't you trust me, Boss?

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:04.241
It's me, Fixer.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.786
I'll make sure she comes,
so don't worry about it.

00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:08.662
Seriously.

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:11.207
I don't trust you, you punk.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.833
How am I supposed to?

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:14.960
Come on.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:16.504
Jeez.

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:22.009
It's been so long, Soo-hyun.

00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:33.437
Move your car!

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:35.189
- I said move your car!
- Here, valet.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.157
You should have shut the door.

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:50.120
Who's she?

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:54.166
These days, serial numbers
are used to verify authenticity

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:55.918
so to get them

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:58.379
we have to hack
the Korean Mint Corporation's server.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:01.215
Meet Yeon, a renowned hacker.

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:04.760
I was going to start this,
counting only on Soo-hyun's skills.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.136
I'm counting on you.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.222
I'll decide after I hear the plan.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.027
So?

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.071
Whose portrait are we using
for the supernote?

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.198
- Madam Saimdang.
- How many?

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:27.825
- A million bills.
- A million?

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:30.286
- And the distribution?
- I'll use 50 billion in fake bills

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.830
to score 200 billion worth of drugs.

00:14:32.913 --> 00:14:34.623
Then I'll split them
and sell them to the mafia

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.417
in Colombia and Mexico
for 100 billion each.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.961
Ask Fixer for more details.

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:44.383
- How much do I get?
- After the ingredients and expenses

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.845
it'll come to around 200 billion,
and we'll split that 6-4.

00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:49.221
Of course, I get six.

00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:50.723
Six to four?

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.809
So 200 billion times 4,
divided by 10...

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.980
Forty billion.

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:04.486
I'm in.

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:06.780
I'm totally in.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.660
You're taking 120 billion alone

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.537
while we split the rest?

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:14.622
What's wrong?

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.415
You don't like it?

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.001
You already know
that in this line of work

00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:22.212
planning and distribution
are more important than production.

00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:25.341
No way.

00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:28.177
I love the idea of splitting.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.637
What's the schedule like?

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.349
Let's keep it tight.
Two weeks of setup

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.893
ten weeks of production,
so that's three months in total.

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:39.730
But we're missing someone
who is the most important.

00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:42.107
Intaglio printing machine.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:44.109
You can't make supernote without it.

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.654
You mean that we need
Kkangsooni, the Iron Curtain, right?

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.908
I tried to look for her a few times,
but I couldn't reach her.

00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:54.411
She's been working on the machine
for five years

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:56.956
so she should be done by now.

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.751
GANGNAM MASSAGE
PICK YOUR COLLEGE GIRL AMONG 50!

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.552
Look at this.

00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:13.055
Did you cut these?

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.265
Look what you've done.

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.559
Do you know how much
one piece of this paper costs?

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.145
It's enough to feed a starving kid

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:22.022
back in your mother country!

00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:24.400
I'm saying this piece of paper

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.485
is as valuable as your life.

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:28.821
Pull yourself together!

00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:31.573
Man, you never stop talking.

00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:33.867
Have you ever been exiled
to the Aoji Coal Mine?

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.704
I've been there twice.

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.372
Have you ever killed a man?

00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:41.875
If you haven't, don't mess with me.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.128
Is Ms. Park Gwang-sun here?

00:16:44.628 --> 00:16:45.921
Who are you?

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:47.715
I am Park Gwang-sun.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.138
Look who this is.

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.188
It's been so long, Kkangsooni.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:12.948
Have you been well?

00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:18.662
Anyway

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.874
who's that little punk
acting smug over there?

00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:22.958
Me?

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:25.961
- You can see me?
- Oh, dear.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.755
You don't seem
to have anything in your head.

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:31.633
- What about my request?
- Come this way.

00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:49.610
Come in.

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:54.573
All right.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.743
Wait, we're going in this way?

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:02.790
Be careful.

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:28.315
I may not have been well-off

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.400
but I never wasted
the investment money.

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:32.653
I put everything into this machine.

00:18:36.156 --> 00:18:37.950
This is what you use to make money?

00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:34.298
BANK OF KOREA
FIFTY THOUSAND WON

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:54.026
This is amazing.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:56.904
Nice.

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:01.617
Kkangsooni.

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:27.226
Serial numbers, hacked.

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.274
Generate ten million new numbers

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:36.235
and register them on
the Korea Mint Corporation's server.

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:37.319
Okay.

00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:44.284
Is it going well?

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:48.497
Hey, throw in 11 million numbers,
and we can split the million.

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:56.296
Is it going well, Kkangsooni?

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.978
Now, five stripes will appear
at the tips of the bill...

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.857
and fine prints on the apricot tree

00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:18.068
will show through intaglio printing.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.570
This completely incapacitates

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:22.447
the forgery prevention aspects.

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:23.657
Let me start the machine.

00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:58.835
- Drink up!
- Cheers!

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:07.135
Darn it.

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.261
- Good work.
- A shot at it all.

00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.976
On the day we finished printing
all 50 billion supernotes

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:18.730
Yeon pestered J
to go party at a wine bar.

00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:20.774
And

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:24.945
I secretly switched out
every single bill in his wallet

00:23:25.862 --> 00:23:28.407
with the freshly minted counterfeits.

00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:35.414
- That'll be 2.75 million won.
- Here's 2.75 million.

00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:38.583
Here.

00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:45.632
2 WEEKS AGO

00:23:57.144 --> 00:23:59.855
I'm calling to report circulation
of counterfeit money in the market.

00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:01.898
Would you like
to share your identity?

00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:04.943
No, I wish to remain anonymous.

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:07.737
We always keep the informant safe.

00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:09.531
That way,
the tip becomes more credible.

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:13.034
You'll be able to check it right away
at the address I shared.

00:24:36.892 --> 00:24:38.268
Where did you get this?

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.145
Spill it.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.069
It was perfect.

00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:49.654
So

00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:52.282
I thought I could deceive everyone.

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:54.493
But

00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:58.705
J found out I reported to the NIS

00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:01.082
- Get inside.
- and locked up Yeon and me.

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:09.090
Supernotes are tough to make,
but you were all finished.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.094
He didn't need you two anymore.
You two were like ticking bombs.

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:14.179
No.

00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:17.516
He wanted to change
the distribution plan

00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:19.559
and forced me to do more work

00:25:20.268 --> 00:25:21.561
by threatening Yeon's life.

00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:22.896
What did he make you do?

00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:31.571
And what was the new plan?

00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:36.576
He printed more supernotes.

00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:39.496
Nine million bills.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.874
With the initial 50 billion won...

00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:46.836
that comes to...

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.921
Five hundred billion?

00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:57.639
And then?

00:25:58.598 --> 00:25:59.599
And then what?

00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:03.687
On the day
we finished printing 500 billion won

00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:06.731
he suddenly moved hideouts.

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:08.775
2 DAYS AGO

00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:15.615
Get Yeon inside too.

00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:17.534
Where?

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.953
- In the container?
- Yes.

00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:22.205
Come on.

00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:23.707
- Go.
- That's right.

00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:28.503
Soo-hyun.

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:31.715
Stay here.

00:26:36.177 --> 00:26:37.220
Clean up everything.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.891
You said you'd do anything I say.

00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:43.643
Right?

00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:49.357
Lock the door.

00:27:15.258 --> 00:27:16.259
And then

00:27:16.509 --> 00:27:19.137
he called you out
to the port the next day, and "bang"?

00:27:20.263 --> 00:27:22.641
He probably
couldn't trust me anymore.

00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:24.809
He got what he wanted

00:27:25.226 --> 00:27:26.519
so I wasn't useful anymore.

00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:28.563
Seriously?

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.817
So now, 500 billion won
in counterfeits is being unleashed?

00:27:34.944 --> 00:27:35.987
Wait.

00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:38.448
With the plate and intaglio machine

00:27:38.531 --> 00:27:40.408
he can print unlimited supernotes.

00:27:43.078 --> 00:27:44.329
This is driving me crazy.

00:27:44.412 --> 00:27:45.997
How will that affect the money supply

00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.582
and the inflation rate?

00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.250
I get what you mean.

00:27:49.876 --> 00:27:50.877
But

00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:53.546
that's all I know.

00:27:57.801 --> 00:27:58.802
Listen up.

00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:01.012
I'll erase

00:28:01.763 --> 00:28:03.390
your name and Yeon's
from the case file.

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.726
Then I'll put him on the wanted list
after you leave Korea.

00:28:07.394 --> 00:28:08.395
How does that sound?

00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:12.357
You rot in prison for three years
because of that jerk.

00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.693
Think about it.

00:28:41.428 --> 00:28:42.429
Yeon.

00:28:43.596 --> 00:28:44.597
Can we talk?

00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:02.365
Where was she taken?

00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:03.533
Yeon.

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:06.411
You knew Soo-hyun went to the NIS.

00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:09.080
She went to the NIS?

00:29:09.164 --> 00:29:10.165
You didn't know?

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:14.919
You really didn't know?

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.171
No.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.923
Well, if you say so.

00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:26.931
She got into a small accident.

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:28.767
So the police got involved.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.351
But in the process

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:34.647
Soo-hyun asked the NIS
to let her talk to Cha Ki-tae.

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:36.274
You see.

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:37.567
Why?

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:39.903
There's no reason for her to do that.

00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:42.405
She got cornered after being caught

00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:43.782
reporting to the NIS

00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:45.992
so she decided to walk in herself.

00:29:47.368 --> 00:29:49.454
- Even so, she...
- Again

00:29:49.537 --> 00:29:51.122
just like five years ago

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:53.792
she'll end up taking the full blame

00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:56.669
and getting locked up.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.148
Jang Joong-hyuk has

00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:19.818
powerful people behind him.

00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:23.696
That was why Cha Ki-tae
lost his case during investigation

00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:25.824
and why Soo-hyun
ended up taking the blame.

00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:28.159
But this time

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:33.122
I plan to make use of that power.

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.793
I will ask them
to guarantee our safety

00:30:36.876 --> 00:30:39.796
by offering half of 500 billion won.

00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:41.798
And of course

00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:45.343
Soo-hyun is included in that group.

00:30:48.638 --> 00:30:52.100
How am I supposed
to believe everything you say?

00:30:53.768 --> 00:30:54.894
And if you don't?

00:30:56.145 --> 00:30:57.730
Will you just leave her there?

00:30:57.981 --> 00:30:59.858
We have to do something.

00:31:02.485 --> 00:31:03.736
I know

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.114
we can get her out safely.

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:07.866
And to do that

00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.492
your talent

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.203
is absolutely necessary.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.164
MYEONGSEONG THRIFT INSTITUTION

00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:18.209
I just need a little more
to take the lead

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.752
but I don't have enough funds.

00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:22.755
We're only three months away.
It sounds like trouble.

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:26.050
You talked like you could find
enough funds just yesterday.

00:31:26.134 --> 00:31:28.887
- What's going on?
- I've run into a sudden problem.

00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:31.848
I've been finding more money
in another way.

00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:33.600
You must try harder.

00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:36.311
You already know I must
get my hands dirty to find money

00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:40.315
that won't cause any scandals
for candidates of both parties

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:43.568
that aren't from a corporation
or a slush fund.

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:47.322
MYEONGSEONG THRIFT INSTITUTION
CHAIRMAN BANG GEUK-HYUN

00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:49.490
- Representative Choi.
- Yes?

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:51.910
I've been extorting money
only from criminals

00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:53.745
to make sure there's no trouble.

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:56.581
This isn't something
that everyone can do.

00:31:56.664 --> 00:31:58.541
I know. I know that very well.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:00.752
You don't seem to
appreciate my hard work.

00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:01.836
I'm disappointed.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.547
I'm asking you
to try just a little harder

00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:05.840
so please don't be disappointed.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.343
I'll take responsibility
and do my part until the end

00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:12.639
so you have to help me
rise to the top of finance.

00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:15.808
Both parties are aware
of your hard work, Chairman Bang.

00:32:16.225 --> 00:32:19.270
I've also been emphasizing it
until people got annoyed

00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:20.813
so don't worry.

00:32:20.897 --> 00:32:23.066
You suddenly can't meet
the funding deadline

00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:25.568
because of the gambling incident
in Incheon, right?

00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:30.448
Yes, that factory was in charge
of making over 70% of the funds

00:32:30.865 --> 00:32:33.493
but that incident
put a halt on everything.

00:32:33.576 --> 00:32:36.287
Was it him again?
Did he get himself into trouble?

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:40.166
Chief Prosecutor,
please step in and help out.

00:32:40.249 --> 00:32:43.419
Well, I took an emergency measure
after getting the call last night.

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:46.506
But I mean, in this day and age?

00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:48.257
Has he lost his mind?

00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:52.136
SEOUL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
CHIEF PROSECUTOR PARK DAE-SIK

00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:57.100
But he's amazingly talented,
making something from nothing

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:58.601
when it comes to fundraising.

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:02.480
I don't care how talented he is.

00:33:02.563 --> 00:33:05.441
If he continues
to cross over the line

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.068
we'll have to cut him off.

00:33:08.027 --> 00:33:10.363
Otherwise, we'll end up harmed.

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:13.074
I'll talk to him.

00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:35.054
I've been anxious
since you kept a low profile.

00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:37.515
This time,
you got yourself into huge trouble.

00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:42.145
I raised your status,
so shouldn't you live accordingly?

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:50.695
I believe the contract
we signed a decade ago says

00:33:51.654 --> 00:33:55.074
we do not meddle
with each other's lifestyles.

00:33:56.075 --> 00:33:57.076
Yes.

00:33:57.785 --> 00:33:59.078
Ever since I met you

00:33:59.162 --> 00:34:00.663
I got to join the Eul Society.

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.624
I was a loan shark
funded by the yakuza

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:05.501
but now I'm the chairman
of a third-tier finance group

00:34:05.585 --> 00:34:08.254
after taking over eight thrift banks.

00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:11.299
And that means I'm almost there.

00:34:12.008 --> 00:34:13.926
I'm about to enter
the top-tier financial sector

00:34:14.427 --> 00:34:18.598
and Woorim Financial Group's
chairmanship is just ahead.

00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:21.392
So be as careful as you can.

00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:23.269
Don't let anger control your actions.

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:27.398
Did you handle this incident
so that nothing would happen?

00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:29.150
Chief Prosecutor Park's already acted

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:30.818
and he said he'd handle everything.

00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:34.072
Anyway

00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:36.866
we had to stop the factory,
our biggest source of income

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:37.950
so what do we do now?

00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:46.042
We don't have to run
the factory in secret

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:47.627
or meet dangerous kids anymore.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.421
That's a business proposal
that can bring in 300 billion won

00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:53.257
just by standing around
and looking cool, so take a look.

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.267
SUPERNOTE BUSINESS PROPOSAL

00:35:08.981 --> 00:35:10.358
Is this really possible?

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:17.573
Take your time to read it,
and feel free to ask questions.

00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:19.367
I'll give you
as much time as you need.

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.127
KC FINANCIAL GROUP

00:35:56.654 --> 00:36:00.158
J is about to circulate
500 billion won worth of supernotes.

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:05.163
But we're sitting here,
not ready, and losing time.

00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:09.167
J's 500 billion won
distribution plan.

00:36:11.252 --> 00:36:12.503
What could it be?

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:31.522
You're about the only person
who would suddenly call me

00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:34.066
Jang Joong-hyuk, and want to meet me.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.361
It seems like

00:36:38.446 --> 00:36:40.823
you've been waiting for me to call.

00:36:41.282 --> 00:36:43.492
Did the business proposal I sent you

00:36:44.327 --> 00:36:46.954
keep spinning round and round
on your mind?

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:48.998
What a load of bullshit.

00:36:49.081 --> 00:36:51.167
You never miss a moment
to act cocky, do you?

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:52.251
Follow me.

00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:55.171
I'll show you
the documentary proposal.

00:36:57.673 --> 00:36:59.342
Man, the weather's so nice.

00:37:02.345 --> 00:37:03.596
Good work, everyone.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.431
Hey, you.

00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:37.690
