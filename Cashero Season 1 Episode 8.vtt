WEBVTT

00:13.263 --> 00:14.889
BEOMHA LOGISTICS

00:40.290 --> 00:43.043
Why are you here?
I thought you said it was suicide.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.713
"Seek death, and you shall live.
Seek life, and you shall die."

00:48.465 --> 00:50.884
And we've shared a bond
as members of the society.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.514
So you said that to Mister on purpose?

00:57.182 --> 00:58.767
We need to raise him with tough love.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.186
He's our only hope.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.193
Min-suk.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.529
I won't be late this time.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.135
That damn superhuman bastard.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.256
1,000 won for each of you.
So let's make it quick, shall we?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.357
Kang Sang-ung entered through the rooftop.

03:57.695 --> 03:58.780
Your pushover is here.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.657
I heard it too, you know?

04:01.866 --> 04:03.034
It's too bad.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.994
You're all dead meat now.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.957
Proceed as planned.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.632
Min-suk.

04:19.550 --> 04:20.468
Min-suk!

04:36.651 --> 04:39.821
Of course, I didn't expect
today to be easy either.

04:44.993 --> 04:50.290
If they keep swarming in like this,
even 1,000 won each would be too much.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.697
You said it was suicide.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.866
-How did you get in?
-The rooftop.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.451
And your powers?

05:27.243 --> 05:28.619
He said he came from the rooftop.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.292
Sang-ung! Kang Sang-ung!

05:34.959 --> 05:36.461
-Let go, damn it!
-Min-suk!

05:36.544 --> 05:38.421
Sang-ung! Let go of me!

05:39.922 --> 05:41.674
-Sang-ung, go.
-Sang-ung, be careful!

05:41.758 --> 05:43.468
Save Min-suk and get Jo Nathan!

05:44.344 --> 05:45.762
-Let go!
-I'll leave it to you.

05:47.889 --> 05:51.351
Sang-ung! Kang Sang-ung!

05:51.434 --> 05:53.019
Let me go!

05:54.062 --> 05:55.021
Sang-ung!

06:07.325 --> 06:08.701
There are so many of them.

06:09.744 --> 06:10.912
Bring it on!

06:12.538 --> 06:13.623
Sang-ung.

06:19.587 --> 06:20.463
Why are you so late?

06:23.549 --> 06:25.843
I was a bit busy.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.018
Sang-ung. Kang Sang-ung!

06:34.102 --> 06:35.061
No!

06:36.562 --> 06:37.855
Hey! Let go of me!

06:41.567 --> 06:43.027
Sang-ung. Are you okay?

06:43.611 --> 06:44.779
You crazy…

06:46.697 --> 06:48.282
-Are you okay?
-Sorry.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.034
I just needed to check.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.542
You're not healing.
I guess you're out of money.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.310
No stupid moves.
Let's make it clean and quiet.

07:17.311 --> 07:21.691
If you just hand over your superpowers,
you can both return home safely.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.193
If you don't…

07:40.918 --> 07:43.754
I'll throw this lady in there.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.681
Superpowers.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.392
What's so great about that?

08:34.305 --> 08:35.389
Have you decided?

08:43.189 --> 08:44.524
Now!

09:09.340 --> 09:11.050
Damn it.

09:14.428 --> 09:15.304
Mr. Attorney.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.348
Mr. Attorney.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.740
-Fucking bastards!
-Let go!

09:35.741 --> 09:37.702
Damn it. Let go!

09:38.244 --> 09:39.704
This was your choice.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.685
Hey, Kang Sang-ung. What are you doing?

10:03.227 --> 10:04.228
Sang-ung.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.773
Open up. What are you doing?

10:09.692 --> 10:11.235
Thank God I wasn't late today.

10:15.489 --> 10:17.533
No. Open the doors.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.411
Sang-ung. Just open the doors now.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.079
Sang-ung, you can't!

10:22.163 --> 10:25.041
No, please! Don't go, Sang-ung.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.959
Sang-ung. You can't!

10:27.043 --> 10:28.461
Don't go, Sang-ung!

10:28.544 --> 10:29.378
Sang-ung!

10:33.591 --> 10:34.967
Please just open the doors.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.385
Sang-ung!

10:36.469 --> 10:38.888
Sang-ung!

10:59.241 --> 11:01.243
My strength doesn't come from money.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.579
What did you just say?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.089
It comes from the heart.

11:33.150 --> 11:36.237
This is how I died.

11:36.904 --> 11:37.905
The cause of death?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.157
Lack of money.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.832
As Beomha Group pushes ahead
with the launch of "Spec-up,"

11:47.915 --> 11:51.794
side effects, including abnormal behavior
and hallucinations, are being reported.

11:52.294 --> 11:55.756
Last Tuesday night, the Gangnam area
of Seoul was thrown into chaos.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.259
About 50 people ganged up
and began looting.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.468
Beomha Pharmaceutical's…

11:59.552 --> 12:02.012
They went on a rampage,
breaking doors and windows.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.931
Attacking pawnshops and banks…

12:04.014 --> 12:05.141
Unexpected side effects…

12:05.224 --> 12:07.768
Beomha Group stated
they completed clinical trials

12:07.852 --> 12:10.062
and received official approval,

12:10.146 --> 12:15.568
and that no link between the new drug
and abnormal behavior has been proven.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.445
Jo Nathan.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.281
He died.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.287
But the Mundane Vanguard is not dead.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.169
What do we do now?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.546
Is it all over for us?

12:35.629 --> 12:37.173
We saved Min-suk.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.341
And we kept Sang-ung's superpowers safe.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.719
"Safe"?

12:43.179 --> 12:44.805
Are you seriously saying that?

12:46.515 --> 12:47.349
At that moment,

12:49.059 --> 12:51.395
after Sang-ung saved Min-suk,

12:52.313 --> 12:54.482
what if he had his superpowers taken away?

12:57.985 --> 13:00.196
The Mundane Vanguard
would've become even stronger,

13:00.696 --> 13:03.032
and we would've had no chance
to turn things around.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.617
But instead,

13:05.242 --> 13:07.161
what if he gave up on Min-suk

13:08.120 --> 13:09.705
and kept his superpower safe?

13:11.373 --> 13:14.585
Sang-ung would've been too discouraged
to fight anymore,

13:15.085 --> 13:17.213
meaning no chance
of turning things around either.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.011
What about his death?

13:26.972 --> 13:28.474
That's the absolute worst.

13:29.892 --> 13:30.726
You're right.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.020
It's the worst.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.190
Instead…

13:39.735 --> 13:41.362
we've got a different possibility.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.825
Now that we've hit rock bottom…

13:48.661 --> 13:51.121
people who've remained still until now…

13:53.165 --> 13:54.333
will start to move.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.481
You should see something.

14:18.607 --> 14:19.441
What is it?

14:25.197 --> 14:28.534
ABILITY: ABLE TO TURN BACK TIME
TO ANY CHOSEN MOMENT

14:29.577 --> 14:32.162
NOTE: LEFT THE SOCIETY
DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN VALUES

14:33.163 --> 14:33.998
Find them.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.384
Don't be late next time.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.930
Thank God I wasn't late today.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.266
Open the doors. Sang-ung. You can't!

15:34.350 --> 15:36.727
No, please! Don't go, Sang-ung.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.399
Sang-ung is gone.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.653
And it doesn't feel real.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.740
DON'T BE LATE NEXT TIME

16:07.466 --> 16:08.509
Why are you here?

16:12.429 --> 16:13.514
It's all…

16:17.601 --> 16:19.144
It's all over now.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.283
It's not over yet.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.537
Listen carefully.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.707
This is something
only you can do, Min-suk.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.088
Sang-ung…

16:48.215 --> 16:49.425
We can bring him back.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.769
What do you mean by that?

17:07.151 --> 17:10.029
Do you remember that task force detective?

17:10.946 --> 17:12.322
The one chasing Sang-ung?

17:15.701 --> 17:16.869
Go find him.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.620
TASK FORCE 1
TEAM LEADER HWANG HYEON-SEUNG

17:21.457 --> 17:22.458
That man…

17:22.541 --> 17:24.084
SEOUL POLICE STATION

17:24.752 --> 17:26.587
…can turn back time.

18:14.968 --> 18:15.803
It's been a while.

18:19.306 --> 18:22.059
What? You're not the only one
who wants to turn back time.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.143
Hurry up and go.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.153
-What?
-Go downstairs!

18:33.237 --> 18:34.822
-Shut the doors!
-Hallway, I think.

18:34.905 --> 18:35.906
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

18:45.457 --> 18:46.708
Did Byeon Ho-in send you?

18:47.876 --> 18:49.128
Sang-ung…

18:51.755 --> 18:53.006
Please bring Sang-ung back.

18:53.090 --> 18:57.302
Turning back time and doing something
differently doesn't fix the problem.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.430
What's meant to happen will happen,
and it's always worse.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.141
We won't know that until you try!

19:03.225 --> 19:04.977
How can you just sit around
and do nothing?

19:05.060 --> 19:06.979
We might not be able to save him!

19:07.813 --> 19:10.649
We might waste a precious chance
and fail to save the world.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.154
The world?

19:17.781 --> 19:19.908
While we were all sitting around,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.661
Sang-ung was busy
trying to save the world.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.169
Then who's going to save Sang-ung?

19:35.007 --> 19:38.385
At first, I didn't like
what Sang-ung was doing either.

19:38.927 --> 19:42.514
Still, if he had to fight,
I wanted him to win.

19:45.184 --> 19:49.104
Deep down, you wanted Sang-ung to win,
didn't you?

19:55.068 --> 19:56.445
I can't give up on him.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.077
How could I possibly give up on Sang-ung?

20:04.161 --> 20:06.747
I want to be the one
to help Sang-ung this time.

20:12.628 --> 20:13.837
If you change something,

20:14.922 --> 20:16.632
the one who intervenes loses time.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.009
Your life expectancy is reduced.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.305
It doesn't matter.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.228
I couldn't give Sang-ung his allowance
this month.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.068
So simple.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.613
The two of you

20:41.448 --> 20:42.824
are so much alike.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.039
-Get out!
-Back, now!

20:49.122 --> 20:50.165
Come out!

20:50.249 --> 20:52.918
Once it's all over,
you won't be able to remember anything.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.254
Stop them! Block them!

20:55.337 --> 20:57.839
It will seem as though it never happened.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.138
Remember. It's just for one minute.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.472
Just run straight ahead!

22:19.588 --> 22:21.256
Here's your allowance for this month.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.714
Sang-ung.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.424
Kang Sang-ung!

23:04.925 --> 23:06.426
Hey. Answer me.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.594
Kang Sang-ung!

23:08.095 --> 23:08.929
Answer me.

23:09.513 --> 23:10.764
Please just answer me.

23:11.598 --> 23:12.432
Kang Sang-ung.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.543
Min-suk.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.360
Sang-ung, seriously…

24:48.528 --> 24:51.698
If you act that recklessly again, I swear,

24:53.658 --> 24:55.202
I will kill you.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.913
I'm sorry.

24:58.997 --> 24:59.998
I'm so sorry.

25:01.082 --> 25:03.376
What? What just happened?

25:03.877 --> 25:05.837
I definitely had no money.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.855
-There! It's Kang Sang-ung!
-Wait.

25:24.356 --> 25:28.151
You guys control the outside first
and bring me the person in charge here.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.028
-What about Kang Sang-ung?
-Hurry!

25:30.111 --> 25:31.363
Come on, quick!

25:33.240 --> 25:34.074
Yes, sir.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.201
-Let's go to the west side.
-Okay.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.537
What are you waiting for? Get going.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.413
-Hurry.
-Everyone else, to the east.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.257
Are you feeling okay?

25:50.340 --> 25:51.925
No, I'm not okay.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.177
-Let's just get out of here.
-Okay.

25:54.678 --> 25:55.971
-Let's go.
-Yes.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.891
Just a moment.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.936
Jo Nathan's gone.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.235
Does it have to be this hard to get home?

26:54.821 --> 26:56.364
I managed to save you,

26:56.865 --> 26:59.159
and now you've chosen this place to die?

27:10.879 --> 27:11.713
Hi.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.977
You all work so passionately hard.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.857
You have no idea
how long I've waited for this moment.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.038
This is the end for you. Any last words?

27:49.709 --> 27:50.835
None?

28:45.098 --> 28:49.644
You have no idea how long I've waited
for this moment too.

28:59.946 --> 29:00.780
This is your end.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.742
Any last words?

29:07.871 --> 29:09.164
I guess not.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.086
Father.

29:16.796 --> 29:17.839
Father!

29:23.553 --> 29:24.888
Father.

29:26.681 --> 29:27.807
Father!

29:29.642 --> 29:33.354
They say a happy home is heaven on earth.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.523
This family is truly impressive.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.942
Guess things got messed up.

29:38.693 --> 29:39.694
Don't worry.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.322
You're not dying
before you pay all my money back.

30:12.060 --> 30:12.894
Are you okay?

30:55.061 --> 30:56.729
Do you really have to go this far?

30:56.813 --> 30:59.023
All I need to do is catch Kang Sang-ung.

30:59.899 --> 31:00.817
Once I do,

31:01.651 --> 31:03.152
I can solve everything.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.400
Are you okay?

32:14.432 --> 32:15.558
This is great.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.010
It hasn't been long.

33:43.730 --> 33:44.856
This bastard.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.650
Looks like he took
all the superpower injections.

33:48.317 --> 33:49.402
He's gone berserk.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.435
You and I have unfinished business.

34:23.936 --> 34:24.812
Where are you?

35:19.283 --> 35:20.785
Have you lost your mommy?

35:22.620 --> 35:23.579
Want me to find her?

35:28.251 --> 35:30.169
Jeez. So noisy.

36:01.117 --> 36:04.245
I'll teach that guy a lesson.
Why don't you take this and stay inside?

36:51.042 --> 36:54.462
Hey. Stop messing
with these innocent people.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.214
Just fight me.

36:57.256 --> 36:58.799
I'm the one you want anyway.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.344
Exactly. You should've come sooner.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.146
You kept this good thing

37:14.065 --> 37:15.024
all to yourself?

37:16.567 --> 37:17.860
You got it wrong.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.821
Well, I thought it was nice at first,

37:20.905 --> 37:22.782
but later on, it really sucked.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.660
Living an ordinary life is the best.

37:26.911 --> 37:27.912
Trust me.

37:31.374 --> 37:33.000
Ordinary…

37:38.673 --> 37:40.424
I don't think we can live like that.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.432
There is no tomorrow.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.893
I'll beat him today, no matter what.

38:32.184 --> 38:33.269
Are you all right?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.771
It's a bit dangerous. So please stay back.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.523
Sorry.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.391
This is fun.

39:13.809 --> 39:14.769
It's fun?

39:15.603 --> 39:18.647
I trained so hard just to punch you.

39:19.982 --> 39:22.151
Let me just beat the shit out of you today

39:23.277 --> 39:24.987
and drag you to the police station.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.308
What? What's going on?

40:01.482 --> 40:02.525
What's his deal?

40:11.534 --> 40:13.285
Hey, the lights are back on.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.215
I know that feeling pretty well.

40:27.216 --> 40:28.551
That's the side effect.

40:30.719 --> 40:31.887
Let's stop this now.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.145
Hey.

40:40.729 --> 40:43.816
-How could you come here alone?
-He always does whatever he wants.

40:43.899 --> 40:47.153
Hey! Clean up all the stuff you broke!

41:23.898 --> 41:25.566
-Sang-ung!
-Damn it!

41:25.649 --> 41:26.609
Run!

41:28.652 --> 41:29.528
Bun-mi.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.791
You guys know what your problem is?

41:44.627 --> 41:45.753
You're meddlesome.

42:14.490 --> 42:15.366
What the hell?

42:15.866 --> 42:17.201
Spent all the money already?

42:20.788 --> 42:22.122
Get up.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.962
You said your strength
doesn't come from money.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.883
Where did it come from again?

42:36.053 --> 42:37.137
That's right.

42:38.430 --> 42:39.265
From the heart.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.476
Where's that heart?

43:10.254 --> 43:12.339
I hate that look on your face.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.967
Like you're somebody.

43:33.819 --> 43:35.362
If a hero runs away,

43:37.239 --> 43:38.157
who else will fight?

43:50.919 --> 43:52.004
What do you do?

43:52.921 --> 43:56.842
No one's here to help you now.

44:53.190 --> 44:54.400
Mister!

44:56.610 --> 44:58.487
You can win!

45:03.158 --> 45:05.244
Mister, you've got this!

45:10.040 --> 45:12.084
Here's some money!

45:12.167 --> 45:13.335
Mister!

45:13.419 --> 45:14.378
You've got this!

45:14.461 --> 45:15.379
Get up!

45:15.879 --> 45:17.131
Get up!

46:00.382 --> 46:01.759
You can do it!

46:05.095 --> 46:07.097
-You've got this!
-Come on, get up!

46:15.481 --> 46:16.899
Don't give up!

46:18.066 --> 46:20.235
Bun-mi. Get up right now.

46:33.373 --> 46:35.459
BUN AND MI

46:44.092 --> 46:44.927
Get up!

47:20.754 --> 47:21.713
You're always late.

47:22.714 --> 47:24.758
Time is on my side anyway.

47:27.135 --> 47:28.720
Cut back on it.

47:29.429 --> 47:31.223
Time to think about our health.

47:58.375 --> 47:59.668
Kang Sang-ung!

48:02.129 --> 48:06.049
I don't care about anyone else,
but don't you dare lose to that bastard.

48:11.513 --> 48:13.390
What are you waiting for? Throw some.

48:13.473 --> 48:14.808
Right. Yes.

48:15.809 --> 48:16.810
Let's throw some!

48:18.520 --> 48:19.897
Go, Kang Sang-ung!

48:19.980 --> 48:21.940
-You can win this!
-Don't get hurt!

48:22.024 --> 48:22.900
You've got this!

48:29.364 --> 48:31.491
Everyone's so involved
in other people's business.

48:34.703 --> 48:35.621
You know what?

48:36.622 --> 48:38.373
That's the true essence of a hero.

48:46.214 --> 48:47.466
You can do this!

48:59.561 --> 49:00.479
Mister!

49:12.741 --> 49:14.868
Sang-ung!

49:15.577 --> 49:19.331
Someone says that money has no character.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.628
No, that's wrong.

49:25.837 --> 49:28.131
Every bit of money has its own character.

49:34.596 --> 49:38.183
-And so, in this fight against a villain…
-You son of a bitch!

49:41.561 --> 49:42.479
I won.

50:18.223 --> 50:21.935
I cleaned everything up,
so you should finish things off yourself.

50:24.479 --> 50:25.397
Get out, please.

50:29.443 --> 50:30.944
CORRUPT JO WON-DO MUST APOLOGIZE!

50:37.909 --> 50:39.995
Any comment on
the illegal slush fund allegations?

50:40.078 --> 50:43.999
Are you donating hundreds of billions
in illegal funds to avoid the charges?

50:44.082 --> 50:45.542
Did you amass illegal funds?

50:45.625 --> 50:47.711
Can you disclose
the source of your donations?

50:48.295 --> 50:49.254
Let's go.

50:53.133 --> 50:55.385
Was the donation a deal with prosecutors?

50:55.469 --> 50:58.055
Do you admit to making
and distributing illegal drugs?

50:58.555 --> 50:59.598
Oh? Your watch.

51:01.016 --> 51:02.225
Looks nice, right?

51:02.309 --> 51:03.268
It looks good.

51:03.769 --> 51:05.103
What about the old one?

51:06.813 --> 51:10.192
The old one?
I left it behind in the old days.

51:10.275 --> 51:12.778
I'll cooperate fully
with the investigation.

51:12.861 --> 51:14.529
Are you admitting to the charges?

51:14.613 --> 51:19.159
All the villains who disrupted
my ordinary life have been punished.

51:22.370 --> 51:24.581
Taking advantage
of the brief moment of peace,

51:24.664 --> 51:28.043
the society members
returned to their own lives.

51:28.960 --> 51:31.379
BUN AND MI

52:10.460 --> 52:11.545
Welcome.

52:15.549 --> 52:16.383
Let's see.

52:17.717 --> 52:19.469
What's the best bread here?

52:33.108 --> 52:34.276
Happy birthday.

52:35.402 --> 52:36.862
BYEON SIN-U

52:41.616 --> 52:42.450
Okay, let's eat.

52:44.786 --> 52:46.329
Can I get a bottle of soju here?

52:46.413 --> 52:47.455
Sure.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.499
Do you need to drink that every day?

52:52.544 --> 52:53.628
I know, right?

52:55.672 --> 52:56.506
Here you go.

52:57.465 --> 52:58.592
And how many glasses?

52:58.675 --> 53:00.302
-Just one, please.
-Two, please.

53:02.512 --> 53:04.222
I'll have to drink it eventually.

53:06.808 --> 53:07.809
Just like you, Dad.

53:34.252 --> 53:35.086
Me?

53:35.962 --> 53:37.881
I succeeded in buying my own house.

53:38.673 --> 53:42.302
It took a while because I was busy
fighting villains and saving the world,

53:43.136 --> 53:46.306
but Min-suk and I finally found our place.

53:54.147 --> 53:56.149
Our home! Our very own home!

53:59.736 --> 54:00.570
Wow.

54:06.576 --> 54:11.873
Paying off the balance was even harder
than fighting Jo Nathan.

54:13.124 --> 54:14.125
Sang-ung.

54:14.834 --> 54:17.963
How is it possible
that every room gets sunlight?

54:18.046 --> 54:20.632
Well, it's a four-bay layout.

54:24.177 --> 54:25.011
This is nice.

54:27.597 --> 54:31.893
Oh, right. What was that fun story
you said you'd tell me back then?

54:32.394 --> 54:33.895
I completely forgot about that.

54:33.979 --> 54:35.313
Oh, that's right.

54:36.022 --> 54:37.023
Just a moment.

54:40.068 --> 54:40.902
Here.

54:55.625 --> 54:57.627
What? It's no fun?

55:02.966 --> 55:03.800
No.

55:05.260 --> 55:06.136
It's fun.

55:09.431 --> 55:11.725
NICE TO MEET YOU
CONGRATULATIONS ON BECOMING A DAD!

55:17.856 --> 55:18.732
By the way,

55:19.316 --> 55:22.235
I heard it costs 360 million won
to raise a child.

55:24.279 --> 55:25.113
Sang-ung.

55:26.531 --> 55:27.741
Let's live diligently.

55:29.492 --> 55:30.452
Okay.

55:38.001 --> 55:40.462
That's right. It's fun.

55:40.545 --> 55:41.671
Here?

55:41.755 --> 55:44.841
But the question is always how much.

55:45.508 --> 55:49.471
Does it really cost 360 million won
to raise one child?

55:49.554 --> 55:51.556
Yes. I'm sure I saw it on the news.

55:52.766 --> 55:57.312
From now on, I'll save up
and make our family really happy, okay?

55:57.812 --> 56:00.273
Save up? We can't save up with a baby.

56:00.357 --> 56:03.026
Really? I'll still make you happy.

56:03.610 --> 56:05.487
I know I can!

59:00.203 --> 59:05.208
