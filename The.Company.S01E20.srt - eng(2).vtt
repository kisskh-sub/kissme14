00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.000
(Wei Zhuoran, Wu Yunong)
(I hope that couple)

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.159
(Wei Zhuoran, Wu Yunong)
(is truly as loving as they appear.)

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.480
Zhuoran.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.040
Yunong.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:04.920
Don't worry.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.920
No matter which of us
makes it to the end,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.760
we'll still get
the 10,000 silver dollars.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.520
Then you won't have to go out singing

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.560
and putting yourself on display anymore.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.280
Your godfather

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.919
is such a philanthropist.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.960
I don't mind working.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.879
You're the one who minds.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.000
What do you mean by that?

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.039
If I minded, why would I show up
to support you in person?

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.560
You went because you had no choice.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.319
Or because you're afraid
other people might get ideas about me.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.439
And are my fears unfounded?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.240
Who sent those flowers the other day?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.479
Flowers?

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.960
That was my comeback performance.
I'm supposed to get flowers.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.639
I could ask you the same thing.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:43.919
I thought they were from you,

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:44.719
but they weren't.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.080
I was surprised to learn that too.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.479
Zhuoran.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.039
I genuinely love singing.

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.120
I love the stage.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.719
I'm doing what I love

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.199
and making an honest living.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.520
If other people don't get it, fine.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.879
But you don't understand me either?

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.479
I understand you.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.680
But who understands me?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.159
Do you have any idea
how they laugh at me?

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.879
They say I live off my wife.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.639
That I'm a kept man.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.039
Have you ever thought
about how that feels?

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.479
But…

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.719
Enough. Stop talking.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.639
Once we get the 10,000 silver dollars,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.639
you're done singing.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.560
Zhuoran.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.039
Miss Wu.

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.000
Mr. Wei.

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.479
This is a letter
Master wanted you both to have.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.879
You read it.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.960
Addressed to Yunong.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.000
"I plan to leave with Mingxuan
on the ship departing on the 19th.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.400
Here is some money enclosed.

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.080
I can't come out myself.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.439
Please help me buy

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.480
two tickets."

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.439
Xiuyun's letter.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.839
Yes.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.040
Master said to leave it with you
as a keepsake.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.639
He also wanted me to tell you

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.720
that on September 17th
three years ago,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.879
Xiuyun had wanted
to send this letter to you.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.199
But that day

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.759
you happened to be traveling
with Mr. Wei,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.199
so the letter was returned.

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:38.600
He also said

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.480
that if you had bought the tickets,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.959
they would've taken the ship on the 19th

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:45.639
and wouldn't have run
into the shipwreck.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.670
But no one can blame you
for what you didn't know.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.480
Traveling with your fiancé

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.160
was perfectly reasonable.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:54.600
All right.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.160
The choice is yours now.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:58.519
Who leaves,

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:59.480
and who stays.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.199
Zhuoran.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.879
Let me see that letter.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.040
What's wrong?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.319
If I remember correctly,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.319
that shipwreck happened
in September three years ago.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.199
That September,

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.079
I went to Beiping alone
on a business trip.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.480
I was gone for two whole months.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.970
And you mean to tell me
I was traveling with you?

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.680
I…

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.759
I might've remembered it wrong.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:45.759
Zhuoran,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.079
you stay.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.199
I'll go.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.600
Then you must not
have been in town either.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.600
Otherwise the letter
wouldn't have been returned.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.079
Everyone knew your name.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.900
There's no way
the postman couldn't find you.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.279
Who were you traveling with?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.040
No one.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.439
Then where did you go?

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:10.920
Fine.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.319
I went out of town to perform.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.360
It was a private performance.
I couldn't talk about it publicly.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.600
That's why I told the public
I was traveling with you.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.800
A private performance?

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:24.519
Then tell me.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:26.800
What kind of private performance

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.519
was it?

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.319
I sang for them.
It was a birthday banquet. I entertained guests.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:35.959
What's wrong

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:36.920
with that?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.600
I took those jobs
because the money was fast.

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.480
We weren't married yet.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.839
We had a wedding to prepare,

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.079
and a house to buy.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.319
Even our honeymoon was paid for by me.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.600
If I didn't make money,

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.040
where would it come from?
Fall from the sky?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.879
Money, money, money.

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.079
That's all you ever talk about.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.639
Sometimes I wonder

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.040
whether it's money you love,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.839
or the attention you get from men.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.920
Do you hear yourself?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.000
You know exactly what I mean.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.759
After we got married,
you were always gloomy.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.690
Always complaining
that I didn't earn enough.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.600
I'm a doctor who studied abroad.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.790
Even if I don't make much, it's enough
to keep you fed and warm.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.439
And yet you insist

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.000
on the most expensive of everything.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.399
You couldn't leave the glamorous life.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.820
That's why you couldn't settle down
and went back to singing.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.759
I love a glamorous life?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.120
You knew from the first day you met me
that I love singing.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.279
You don't love singing.

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:37.879
You love having men fawn over you.

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.040
You can't stand being
without men around you.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.079
And just now you were flirting
with that Mr. Pan…

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.160
Wei Zhuoran!

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:50.800
Have…

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.360
Have you no heart?

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:56.800
You say you make money.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.920
What's that money even enough for?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.959
It doesn't even cover the clinic's rent.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.199
If it weren't for me,

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:07.240
you'd have been thrown out
by the landlord long ago!

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.519
So you think I'm useless too.

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:15.560
Aren't you?

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.079
Say that again.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.600
You're useless.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:20.079
Say it again!

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:20.879
You're useless.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.279
Utterly useless!

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:27.879
You'll shut up once I get that money.

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:30.279
That money should've been mine
in the first place.

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:32.080
Elder Yu is my godfather.

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:34.879
If it weren't for me,
do you think you'd even be here?

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.399
Godfather, my foot!

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.159
I bet he was just
another one of your callers.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.360
Wei Zhuoran!

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.240
Don't you talk nonsense!

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.080
Are you out of your mind?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.700
Don't you dare say that! How dare you!

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.590
You've lost your mind!

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.720
How dare you!

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.039
Zhuoran…

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.440
Zhuoran…

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.320
Zhuoran, what's wrong?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.159
Are you all right?

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:07.399
You're bleeding.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.120
Can you get up?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.159
Can you get up?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.000
Easy there.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.120
Yunong…

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:18.679
Yunong…

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.360
What just happened?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.360
I don't know.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.960
I don't know what came over me.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.480
I saw…

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.720
the Hong family's Second Master
on the ground,

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:33.240
but some force kept pushing me forward.

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:35.320
I didn't stop at all.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.440
This isn't a game.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.480
Chess do get taken.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.639
You have to make it to the end.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.159
You hear me?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.679
You have to…

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.639
Zhuoran.

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:54.679
Zhuoran, wake up.

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:55.519
Don't scare me.

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:56.039
Zhuoran!

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:57.080
Zhuoran!

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.480
Is anyone here?

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.159
Anyone?

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.240
Help!

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.279
Someone!

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:06.480
Anyone!

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.120
Miss Wu.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.600
Help!

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.260
(Wei Zhuoran)

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.159
That woman

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:25.399
knows what she's doing.

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.879
She actually won.

00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:29.120
Looks like that loving couple

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.679
was all just an act.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.519
She's your goddaughter.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:37.519
Why would you do this to her?

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:38.919
My goddaughter?

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.159
Right.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.000
When she was young,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.279
I treated her well.

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:53.440
I introduced Xiuyun

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.279
to her,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.039
and they got along wonderfully.

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.399
They were as close as sisters.

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:01.759
It warmed my heart.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.000
But

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.399
she turned her back on us.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.919
Not only

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:12.080
did she fail to stop Xiuyun
from secretly meeting that Zhou fellow,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.639
she even volunteered

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:15.879
to help them elope!

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.960
She was so busy chasing
her own romance, travel, and dreams

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.799
that she completely
ignored Xiuyun's plea!

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.120
My poor Xiuyun

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.759
ended up buying the tickets
just two days late

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.159
and

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.039
boarded that ship

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.720
of no return.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.399
It's my fault.

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:38.600
I must've failed as a father.

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:40.240
I raised her

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.879
the wrong way.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:45.279
That's why Xiuyun was so naive,

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.000
so pure,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
so easy to deceive.

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:51.240
Do you know what I did?

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:54.399
Before she left,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.279
I went to Zhou's hometown.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.799
He already had a wife.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.279
He even had a son.

00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:05.159
He was a liar!

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.440
How could I

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.600
possibly tell her the truth?

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:11.159
For a child that innocent,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.720
it would've destroyed her.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:14.919
I had no choice.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.480
I decided I'd be

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.200
the villain myself.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.039
Get in here!

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:23.720
Father…

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:24.360
Get in!

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:24.879
Father…

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.840
You stay right here.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.039
You're not going anywhere.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:28.559
Father.

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.919
Father, I'm begging you.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.720
Mingxuan isn't who you think he is.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.960
Please, go meet him.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.600
Father.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.360
Xiuyun.

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:38.240
You…

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.080
You're too kind.
Kind to the point of being foolish.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.360
- You're not thinking straight.
- That's not true.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.519
Mingxuan isn't that kind of person.

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.519
Father, you're biased against him.

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:48.879
Xiuyun.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.039
Why would I ever hurt you,
my own flesh and blood?

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:54.000
Watch her.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.200
Father!

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:56.159
Father!

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:57.320
Father!

00:12:57.919 --> 00:12:59.519
Father, let me out!

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:00.279
Father!

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.240
Father!

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.200
Father…

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.440
She's too naive.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.399
Chasing trends.

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:10.799
Learning modern nonsense.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.440
Talking about freedom in love.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.759
Absurd ideas!

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:17.919
I couldn't tell her.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.840
And…

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.879
And she…

00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:22.039
Xiuyun…

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.860
(To: Father)

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.799
(Father,)

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.000
(when you read this letter,)

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.879
(I'll already be on an ocean liner
bound for England.)

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:36.879
(I'm sorry.)

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.799
(I chose to be willful again.)

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:43.159
(I want to fight for my life just once.)

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.120
(I know)

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.639
(you don't like Mingxuan,)

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.039
(but I've already chosen him.)

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.559
(He's promised)

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:52.399
(to support my studies overseas.)

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:55.159
(When I complete my studies and return,)

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.519
(we'll see each other again.)

00:13:58.679 --> 00:13:59.960
(Take care, Father.)

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:03.679
Hong Chi!

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:05.960
Hong Chi!

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.279
Hong Lie!

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.159
Hong Chi! Hong Lie!
Get up! Help me go after Xiuyun!

00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:12.960
Master!

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:13.960
Master.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.720
What happened?

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.560
Where are they?

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:17.600
(Butler Li)
They moved out of Rain Manor ages ago.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.360
Why?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:18.840
Well…

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.480
Master Pan Jingting set them up
with a martial arts center in the city.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.759
It's about to open,

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:25.399
so all their attention's there.

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:26.559
Why would they come back now?

00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:28.190
I raised those useless brats
for nothing.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.159
Why did this have to happen now?

00:14:31.039 --> 00:14:31.519
Follow me!

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:32.039
Hurry!

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:34.039
Master, slow down.
Be careful. Don't fall! Master!

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:39.180
(Eastern Ferry Sank In The Atlantic.
Passengers And Crew Lost. Condolences.)

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.639
Xiuyun…

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.320
I knew this would happen…

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:56.759
I knew it…

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.120
Xiuyun…

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:02.200
My Xiuyun…

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:05.759
Master…

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:08.039
Master, you must be strong.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.559
You… You mustn't let this affect your health.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.480
Xiuyun…

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:32.140
(Rain Manor)

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.460
(One Year Later)

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.240
Xiuyun…

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.159
(Spirit Tablet of Yu Xiuyun)
She came to me in my later years.

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:24.480
She was a caring daughter.

00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:26.320
As they got older,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.759
other girls

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.440
ran after trends

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.639
and longed for the city's glamour.

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:32.799
Only she seemed

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:35.799
afraid I'd be lonely.

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:37.879
She stayed with me every day
at Rain Manor,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960
playing chess,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.799
taking walks,

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.720
singing with me.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.200
Where else

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:49.879
would you find a child like that?

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.240
Why did you stop?

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:54.600
Play your move.

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:56.000
Move!

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.559
I'll make them pay.

00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:58.840
I'll make them understand

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.399
what it means to kill Xiuyun!

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.720
Come on!

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.200
Make your move!

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.319
Miss Wu!

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.319
Miss Wu!

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:17.400
Miss Wu!

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.640
What happened?

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.839
What happened to Mr. Wei?

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:21.720
I'm sorry, Xiuyun.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.400
I should've bought you the tickets.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.720
What are you talking about?

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.640
I'm sorry…

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.480
I'm sorry…

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.480
I'm sorry…

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.920
What in the world is going on?

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.759
I'm sorry, Xiuyun.

00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:33.559
Is anyone there?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.279
Help!

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:36.000
Someone! Anyone!

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.160
(This nameless chess is Scrappy. )

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.240
(I can't let him
run into the black chess.)

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:52.860
(Pan Jingting)

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.880
White Chess No. 3

00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:56.160
will take three steps.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.500
(Pan Yunzhe)

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.440
Miss Ning?

00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:38.960
Mr. Pan.

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:40.759
Elder Yu has a gift for you.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.599
Father.

00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:59.519
You may leave.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.720
You've come to take me out, have you?

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:05.359
How disrespectful you've become.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.640
Talking to your own father like this.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.960
It's the rules of the game.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.079
Father,

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.119
don't you want me to get
the 10,000 silver dollars?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.400
So you can

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.480
blow it all?

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.519
Don't even think about it.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.720
We agreed

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:23.519
to come to dinner.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.079
No arguing.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.920
You're the one asking to borrow money.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.920
Whether I lend it or not is up to me.

00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:32.559
Why would I need to argue with you?

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.480
So you really won't lend it to me?

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.039
Lend it so you can buy useless junk,

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:41.720
or waste it drinking and fooling around?

00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:42.680
Father!

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.279
I need the money to grease the wheels.

00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:50.960
The underworld, the authorities,
customs, the chamber of commerce.

00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:52.559
You're in business too.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.440
Surely you understand.

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:55.559
Grease the wheels?

00:19:56.319 --> 00:19:58.920
More like an excuse for smoking opium
and pursuing women!

00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:03.740
No matter what, I'd never force

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:06.200
an innocent woman into a tragedy.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.599
Especially not a friend's daughter.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.160
What did you just say?

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:18.799
Do you recognize this fan?

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.319
No.

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:22.880
It's Xiuyun's fan.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.319
Zhou Mingxuan met Yu Xiuyun

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.000
because of this fan.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.079
(Back then,)

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.390
(Zhou Mingxuan was a senior manager
at a trading company.)

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:49.400
(He told you the story behind this fan.)

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.200
(You knew its owner was Xiuyun.)

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.079
(But you never bothered to investigate
whether he already had a family)

00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:57.000
(before introducing Xiuyun to him.)

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.519
(I was completely)

00:20:58.519 --> 00:20:59.640
(in the dark.)

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.319
(I was the one
who personally asked Xiuyun out.)

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.599
Let me introduce you.

00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:06.160
This is Zhou Mingxuan
from Overseas Trade.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:06.920
Mr. Zhou.

00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:08.079
Hello.

00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:09.920
This is Miss Xiuyun.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.160
Hello.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.160
Miss Xiuyun, please have a seat.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.279
Mr. Zhou.

00:21:23.599 --> 00:21:25.640
Yunzhe and I have something
to attend to.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.319
We'll excuse ourselves first.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:27.799
All right.

00:21:27.839 --> 00:21:28.640
Please, go ahead.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:29.890
We'll get together another day.

00:21:30.319 --> 00:21:31.839
Miss Xiuyun, you two enjoy yourselves.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.000
Father.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.440
Let's go.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.759
What was that about?

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:44.519
Nice to meet you, Miss Xiuyun.

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.720
They call you Mr. Zhou?

00:21:46.759 --> 00:21:48.160
You can call me Mingxuan.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.119
Mingxuan.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.559
All right.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.279
You left

00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:56.799
this fan behind.

00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:59.790
I finally have a chance
to return it to you.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.279
So it was with you.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.680
I've been looking for it everywhere.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.559
Thank you.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.440
You're welcome.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.640
Elder Yu

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:12.559
is your old friend.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.319
What you did was too much!

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.960
Zhou Mingxuan isn't a bad man.

00:22:17.079 --> 00:22:17.559
Besides,

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.960
do you think I got close to him

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.319
for myself?

00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:21.759
I did it for you.

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:24.240
You listened to your so-called friends

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.880
and imported a batch of defective goods.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.799
If Zhou Mingxuan's company
hadn't helped you handle the returns,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.680
do you have any idea
how much you'd have lost?

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.119
Could you even afford it?

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:34.279
You never trusted me.

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:37.480
That shipment wasn't defective at all.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.920
It was cheap,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.599
high volume,

00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:41.599
and perfectly fixable with machines.

00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:43.200
I had my reasons.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.400
But you never once cared
about how I felt!

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.640
You're uneducated, useless,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.759
and going nowhere in life!

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:48.880
If it weren't for me,

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:51.839
you'd be broke
and sleeping on the streets by now.

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:53.400
And you think you're any better?

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.340
You're just living off
your father's inheritance.

00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:58.260
And if it weren't for my grandpa,
would you even have this family fortune?

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.480
Father?

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:07.599
Father.

00:23:07.599 --> 00:23:08.519
Get away from me!

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.359
Even if I die,

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.559
you won't get

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.599
a single cent of my inheritance.

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:20.240
We'll see

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:22.599
whether I've got what it takes.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.559
You killed my Xiuyun.

00:23:29.119 --> 00:23:31.519
So I'll let your son
torment you in return.

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:33.440
That's fair.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.160
An eye for an eye!

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920
Allow me.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:47.799
Nobody move!

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:53.240
Strike the alms bowl! Now!

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.920
Keep striking. Don't stop!

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.759
Keep your hand on him.

00:24:03.799 --> 00:24:04.759
I'll be right back.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.440
Pan Yunzhe!

00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:13.480
Stay away!

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:15.799
Come to your senses!

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:19.559
What happened here?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.200
Can anyone please explain?

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.920
Leave this to me.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.400
You showed up just in time.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:27.690
I don't know what came over them.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.000
Why did they start fighting?

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:30.400
And Miss Wu and her husband…

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:32.039
There was an accident.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.279
Perhaps the prize was too tempting.

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:35.400
People got carried away.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.790
You call this getting carried away?

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.160
Mr. Wei hurt his head!

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.359
- You need to get someone to save him!
- I know.

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:42.319
However, Mr. Su,

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.480
if you break the rules of the game,

00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:46.119
you won't win the prize.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.519
Forget about the prize!

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:48.960
You might not even be able

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.200
to leave Rain Manor.

00:24:58.119 --> 00:25:00.640
So this was all premeditated.

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:02.720
What are your intentions?

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.799
I suggest

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.920
you return to your place.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.000
Your friend's still playing.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.079
Master said

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.799
only obedient chess

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.880
keep the players safe.

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:20.279
You and your friend are outsiders.

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:23.190
As long as you comply
and finish the game with Master,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.200
you'll leave safely.

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:41.359
Stop striking.

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:43.599
Mr. Bizhi,

00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:45.279
you mustn't do this.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.759
Don't forget

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.240
that your friend's still on the board.

00:25:49.559 --> 00:25:50.680
I suggest

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.400
you sit back down.

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.119
Otherwise…

00:25:59.119 --> 00:26:00.039
Do as she says.

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:01.880
Return to your seat

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:04.519
and finish the game.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.720
(Pan Yunzhe, Pan Jingting)
These two have forfeited the match.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.359
Like father, like son.

00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:38.559
A pair of useless cowards.

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:39.759
Pathetic.

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:42.440
Now there's only your friend left.

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:45.799
Let's see how lucky he is.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.440
White Chess No. 4 will take one step.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.079
(Su Beilu)
Black Chess No. 4 will take three steps.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.119
Chongyang.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.160
It's you.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.279
Just call me Scrappy.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.200
You're not scrappy at all.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.519
I was way scrappier than you

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:52.480
when I was a kid.

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:54.000
I think

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.599
I'll call you Chongyang instead.

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:57.599
Thank you.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.200
Are you here to take me out?

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.920
Looks like it.

00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:05.680
All right.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.480
Then sit with me and talk to me.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.119
You're the only person
who's spoken to me tonight.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.559
Is Grandpa unhappy tonight?

00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:21.759
Elder Yu?

00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:23.599
He doesn't let me call him that.

00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:25.799
But I do consider him my grandpa.

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:31.440
That means your mother is his daughter.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.839
Where is your mother?

00:28:34.599 --> 00:28:36.960
My mother isn't his daughter.

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:39.720
I'm a child nobody wanted.

00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:42.000
My father died at sea.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.359
My mother couldn't afford to raise me,

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:46.640
so she left me at Rain Manor's entrance.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.880
Grandpa took me in.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.720
I know he didn't like my father.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.440
But he was willing to raise me,

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.599
and I'm grateful for that.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.920
I don't want him to be unhappy.

00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:01.519
If he raised you

00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:04.400
all these years,

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:05.839
he must

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:07.839
care about you.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.400
He must have

00:29:09.759 --> 00:29:11.920
his reasons.

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:13.079
Really?

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.480
My parents passed away

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:17.680
when I was little too.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.559
My grandmother raised me.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.920
She was always busy.

00:29:23.839 --> 00:29:25.400
I used to resent her.

00:29:26.079 --> 00:29:27.279
Then I grew up

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.200
and realized

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.839
she was working herself sick

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.400
just to earn money.

00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:36.839
I regret

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.119
not treating her better.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.839
Listen.

00:29:43.519 --> 00:29:45.880
If you have no family left

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.640
in this world,

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.960
then the person who treats you best

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:52.960
is your family.

00:29:53.839 --> 00:29:55.680
You have to be good to them,

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.759
okay?

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Hong Lie?

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.599
(Hong Lie)
White Chess No. 2 will take five steps.

00:30:47.319 --> 00:30:48.279
(Su Beilu,)

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:49.519
(be safe.)

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.119
The prize is mine.

00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:56.039
I won't give it to you.

00:30:56.319 --> 00:30:57.759
I'm going to use it

00:30:57.759 --> 00:30:59.240
to revive the martial arts center!

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.839
Go to the courtyard right now.
Find the young man playing chess

00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:03.880
and tell him where I am.

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:28.079
The draw.

00:31:28.759 --> 00:31:29.759
Once played,

00:31:30.039 --> 00:31:31.559
the two chess in conflict must cease,

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:32.759
and neither will be harmed.

00:31:33.079 --> 00:31:34.279
Those were your rules,

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:34.839
Elder Yu.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:36.759
Go!

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:44.930
White Chess No. 2 will take three steps.

00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:51.799
Black Chess No. 4 will take four steps.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.400
How exciting.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.240
(Hong Lie, Su Beilu)
Now it's getting interesting.

00:31:54.599 --> 00:31:56.640
I wonder if your friend

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.240
has the strength left
to finish these last few moves.

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:23.319
All of this was your setup.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.759
You knew the Liubo Chess
could manipulate minds.

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:26.890
When you're inside the game,

00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:30.359
it fuels obsession,
even turning family against each other.

00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:32.759
You chose Xiuyun's birthday

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:35.359
to take revenge on everyone
connected to her death.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.839
But Elder Yu, don't forget this.

00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:38.440
Xiuyun died

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.480
in a shipwreck during a storm.

00:32:42.079 --> 00:32:43.279
That was a natural disaster.

00:32:43.319 --> 00:32:43.839
Wrong.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.039
Xiuyun didn't die

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.880
because of nature.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.200
Every one of them is a murderer!

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:54.519
You're blaming everyone else.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.519
But have you ever thought
about your own fault?

00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:56.960
My fault?

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.960
Why did Xiuyun elope
without telling you?

00:32:59.319 --> 00:33:01.599
Wasn't your love a form of control?

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.279
How much freedom did you ever give her?

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:04.480
Don't talk to me about freedom!

00:33:04.839 --> 00:33:05.720
What is freedom?

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.119
Wasn't my love enough?

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.079
I gave her everything!

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.440
Enough.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.000
Play.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.079
Play!

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.839
No one's leaving Rain Manor tonight

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.359
until this game is finished.

00:33:19.839 --> 00:33:20.440
Play!

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:37.599
I win.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.440
Master.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.839
I remember Aunt Xiuyun.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.359
What did you say?

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.640
I remember Aunt Xiuyun.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.400
You met her?

00:33:55.319 --> 00:33:56.279
Impossible.

00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:58.839
Father took me to a coffee shop

00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:00.200
to meet her.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.279
She said I looked like a little snowman.

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:06.160
She said they'd study abroad together,

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.199
and we'd all live together
when they returned.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.079
She…

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.880
She knew about you?

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:19.159
I remember Aunt Xiuyun loved cream cake

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.280
with red berries.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.480
Just like this.

00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:24.360
Master,

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.400
you never eat these.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.519
But Aunt Xiuyun liked them.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.480
Xiuyun…

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.400
You're too kind.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.480
You knew everything all along.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.719
Zhou told you everything too.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:53.960
I don't understand

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.960
why you'd still choose this dead end.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.159
They showed no care at all

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.679
when you died.

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:14.119
They never once meant

00:35:14.639 --> 00:35:15.920
to hurt Xiuyun.

00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:19.920
In fact, they've been remembering her
in their own ways.

00:35:20.679 --> 00:35:22.559
That cake was from Wu Yunong.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.840
Even though Hong Lie and Hong Chi

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.760
are barely getting by,

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.440
they still insist on running
a woman's swimming class.

00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:32.840
That's for Xiuyun too.

00:35:33.239 --> 00:35:35.480
The money backing them
comes from Pan Jingting.

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:37.840
Master Pan wanted
to do his part for her.

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:45.039
Stop.

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:49.039
Say no more.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.760
Elder Yu,

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.500
obsession is like a disease
that clings to your bones.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.599
It's trapped you here in Rain Manor

00:36:01.719 --> 00:36:02.719
all these years.

00:36:03.679 --> 00:36:04.800
Please try to let it go.

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:09.239
Your friend asked me to tell you

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.480
he's over there.

00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:13.039
Look after Elder Yu.

00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:17.559
Master.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.760
Su Beilu!

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.800
Su Beilu!

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.760
Su Beilu.

00:36:36.159 --> 00:36:36.920
Su Beilu!

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:38.039
Over here!

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.800
Are you all right?

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.760
I'm fine.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.039
Master Hong,

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:45.360
are you all right?

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.079
What happened to me?

00:36:49.519 --> 00:36:50.519
Can you get up?

00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.679
How are you feeling?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.700
Something's wrong.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.039
I think I might've hurt my brother.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.000
I need to find him.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.599
Based on the board,

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:08.880
he should be over that way.

00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:10.360
Thank you.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.880
I thought you'd never get back up.

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:30.199
You scared me.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.199
I'm sorry,

00:37:34.199 --> 00:37:34.800
Zhuoran.

00:37:35.159 --> 00:37:36.000
I'm sorry.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.320
I won't sing anymore.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.880
I'll stay home with you.

00:37:42.199 --> 00:37:44.199
I was being petty before.

00:37:47.079 --> 00:37:48.199
I'm sorry, Yunong.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.800
You were born for the stage.

00:37:53.719 --> 00:37:55.320
How could you ever leave it?

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.000
I was wrong, Yunong.

00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:06.199
I'm sorry.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.280
Don't cry.

00:38:11.639 --> 00:38:12.960
There, there…

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:23.440
Father.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.079
Father.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.280
Are you all right?

00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:29.119
I'm fine.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.800
What about you?

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.519
I'm all right.

00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:35.000
Good.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.920
Father.

00:38:39.719 --> 00:38:40.639
I was wrong.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.000
Chi!

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:48.000
Lie.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.239
Chi!

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:50.559
I'm here, Lie.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.880
Chi.

00:38:56.119 --> 00:38:57.119
I'm fine, Lie.

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:05.119
Chi.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.440
I don't know what got into me.

00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:09.679
I'm so sorry.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.719
Lie.

00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:13.360
I don't know
what came over me just now.

00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:14.960
All these years,

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.199
I've been too stubborn, too controlling.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.360
I wanted to fight
for everything for you.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.840
I never realized

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.679
how badly you misunderstood me.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.760
I'm sorry.

00:39:27.719 --> 00:39:28.519
Lie,

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.920
you've had it hard all these years.

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:33.440
I just didn't want to be

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.920
the little brother
who always needs your protection.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.660
I wanted to carry
some of the weight too.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.480
Here.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.360
Come on.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.400
Let's go.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.519
How are you holding up?

00:39:57.519 --> 00:39:58.250
Are you all right?

00:39:59.039 --> 00:39:59.960
I'm fine.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.679
You won, right?

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.960
I thought it'd just be
a simple game of Liubo Chess.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.199
I never expected it
to spiral into all this chaos.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.599
They were all bewitched
by the power of the Chess.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.400
But you won in the end.
That's what matters.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.119
We've got the Liubo Chess back as well.

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:17.400
Let's go home.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.440
Let's go.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:20.800
Are you sure you're fine?

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.679
Yes.

00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:24.370
You lasted a few rounds
against Master Hong.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.199
Not bad.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.159
I underestimated you.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.119
Su Beilu!

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.119
Su Beilu!

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.400
I was trying to play the hero…

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.480
Guess I couldn't pull it off…

00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:53.000
Su Beilu.

00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:54.320
