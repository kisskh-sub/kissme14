00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

=Episode 18=

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.759
Long Zhentian!

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.639
Chun.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.719
Didn't you run away? Why are you back?

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.520
How could I run away?

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:02.560
We...

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.280
are friends, aren't we?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.360
Without me, this rock

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.400
is incomplete.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.199
You have run out of inner power.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.719
Killing you

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.599
would be as easy as killing an ant.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.660
I may not have inner power,

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.080
but I still have my skills.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.960
Today, even if we have to die,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.960
we'll die together.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.639
Don't jinx us.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.680
Playing the hero

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.039
comes with a huge price tag.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.039
Xiaomin!

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.159
Su Beilu!

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.479
You're not the Sword Immortal.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.199
I see your true face.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.599
Who are you exactly?

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.759
Given the situation,

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:11.960
there's no harm telling you.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.800
I am not the Sword Immortal.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.199
I can morph into anyone.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.759
So, you deceived me.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.839
It wasn't you

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.160
who gave me my inner power.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.000
You also deceived everyone, didn't you?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920
That inner power

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.319
is not yours to begin with.

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.150
Only by transforming into
the Sword Immortal

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.240
can I force the truth from you

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.959
so as to sow discord

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.639
among the martial arts masters!

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.199
Why, you...

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:49.600
despicable crook!

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.199
Your puny effort is futile.

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:58.839
Save it.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.360
Without any inner power,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.720
you're nothing.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.800
You can't say I'm nothing.

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:17.800
You can't say I'm nothing.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.250
You're nothing, that's what you are.

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.879
You're a useless bum.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:34.720
You shouldn't even exist in this world!

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.759
What do you think?

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.160
I'm going to beat you up!

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.240
You coward, so timid
and afraid of heights.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.160
Min would never like you.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.399
You're a coward and a liar.

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.560
I'm not!

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.399
You're so weak.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:50.160
I'm not.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.439
Even a breeze could blow you off.

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.079
I'm not!

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.800
You can't even fend for yourself.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.560
You coward.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.120
You chicken.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.160
How could this be?

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.879
Since I get to be here,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.560
it means I'm no longer afraid.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.160
No matter what you turn into,

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:30.600
I'm still who I am!

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.560
Su Beilu is my best friend.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.319
He's never looked down on me.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.959
We're brothers for life!

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.879
My parents may be naggy,

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:49.680
but they mean well.

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:51.720
The person they love the most

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.240
is me!

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.680
The manager may be stingy,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.959
but he wants the best for the hospital.

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.319
I can understand him.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.639
Xiaomin is kind and forgiving.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:10.120
She's never despised me.

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:11.800
Otherwise...

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.399
Otherwise, why would I
fall in love with her?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.279
You're awake again.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160
Sword Immortal.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.439
Am I dead?

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:00.279
Yes.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.399
You and Long Zhentian died together.

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:10.480
So...

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.279
Are you the save point for this game?

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:16.800
This isn't a game.

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:18.319
It's not?

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.079
What is it, then?

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.680
Think of it as a dream.

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:25.079
A dream?

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.079
However,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.000
you can choose to relive.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.559
No, thanks.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.039
To me, winning and losing

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.679
aren't that important anymore.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.820
That's because I've found something

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.720
more valuable than that.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.039
I guess

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.679
I have no use for this sword now.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:05.679
Take it back.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.639
Well?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.279
Did you rest well?

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:48.799
Sorry.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:52.039
I guess I dozed off.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.639
How long did I sleep?

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:58.080
About half an hour.

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.399
It was 8:30 when you came,
and now it's 9:00.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:02.559
Only half an hour?

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.440
Why do I feel like
I'd been asleep for days?

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:05.799
Feeling better now?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.360
Yeah.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.840
I had a very long dream.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.639
I dreamed of so many people

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.440
and events.

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.919
Boss, you were in my dream too.

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:26.000
That means you slept soundly.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:28.240
So...

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.480
Now that you're awake,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.320
many of your troubles
have been resolved, right?

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:36.080
I guess so.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.960
Boss,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.240
it's getting late.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.759
Don't let me keep you from closing.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:42.840
Sure.

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:54.720
Thanks, boss.

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:58.440
Thank you.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:37.460
(Yashe)

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.380
(Yashe)

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:06.799
Maybe he's at the junction?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.559
No,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.360
impossible.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.919
Is that Chun Ge?

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:10.799
Chun Ge?

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.240
Chun Ge!

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:15.580
What brings you guys here?

00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:22.679
What's wrong?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.600
Why the tight hug?

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:25.960
Where have you been?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.159
Yeah, where did you go?

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:30.600
It's so great to see you guys.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.440
We just met not long ago.

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:38.120
What's with that silly chuckle?

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.440
Even your parents called me.

00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:43.559
My parents called you?

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.679
We skipped

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:46.559
the live performance to look for you.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.120
Because of you,
Xiaomin skipped the autograph session too.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.120
- How are you going to make it up to us?
- How?

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:54.000
What live performance?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.920
What autograph session?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.879
This.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.039
What's his name again?

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.279
JC, I've told you umpteen times.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.759
This singer. He's also sung
your favorite anime songs.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.000
JC?

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.840
You like him too?

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:07.279
Yeah.

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:08.799
I wanted to give you a surprise.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.960
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:14.639
You sprained your ankle, right?

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:16.600
I was worried that you
couldn't stand for long,

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.360
so I told Su Beilu not to trouble you

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.799
so you can get some rest.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.279
Next time, you literally
have to drag me there,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:23.840
okay?

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.080
I'm not strong enough to drag you.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.320
I can, but do you really expect Xiaomin
to buy you free tickets?

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.480
- Wait...
- Yeah.

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:31.240
Wait for me.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.759
If he has another performance,

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:35.360
I'll buy you guys tickets.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.519
You should call your mom first.

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:38.360
Okay.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.700
(Leave it if you
don't feel like eating.)

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.320
(The porridge was delicious.
Thanks, Mom and Dad.)

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.820
(Yashe)

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:26.080
From the west, a glimpse of the east.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.440
From the east, a glimpse of the west.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.960
Harbor no traveler in the night,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.840
and harm no upright man in the day.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.559
Are you playing chess?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.720
Aeroplane chess?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.320
Count me in.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.600
From high, all can be suppressed.

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:51.320
From below, all can be viewed.

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:53.759
What are you doing?

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:55.279
You've been ignoring me.

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:57.039
You almost look like you're possessed.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.679
This is Liubo Chess.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.680
Not many people know about it now,

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.960
but it was very popular during
the Warring States period

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.080
and even the Qin and Han dynasties.

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:07.799
You could say that this is

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:09.840
the ancestor of many other chess games.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.279
Even modern chess

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:13.679
still refer to this ancient game, right?

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:14.799
You catch on fast.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.399
Exactly.

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:17.679
Count me in, then. Let's play.

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:18.639
You'd never learn.

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:19.440
Teach me first.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.600
Maybe I can learn.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.720
What I was saying earlier

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.200
refers to the position
of the chess pieces.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.720
These six bamboo sticks are thrown

00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:31.720
to decide the number of steps taken.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.159
Whoever moves four pieces
across the board first

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:35.519
wins the game.

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:36.559
In ancient times,

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:38.320
this game is actually
used for divination.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.720
It tells fortunes

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:44.080
by placing the 60 pieces on the board

00:16:44.159 --> 00:16:46.200
according to the sexagenary
reading of the day,

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:48.519
then finding one's corresponding piece.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:50.799
From there, one's fortune can be told.

00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:53.559
That's what I was doing just now.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.039
What did you ask?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.930
I asked many questions,

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.519
and the answers were favorable.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:00.840
And you?

00:17:01.039 --> 00:17:02.159
What's on your mind?

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:03.679
I can help you seek your fortune.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.799
Well, here's my question.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.640
Will there be any business today?

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.680
Let's ask the board?

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:17.160
West.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.440
West.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.720
A lucky find.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.559
Great fortune.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.240
Impossible, it's getting dark soon.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.079
No one would come.

00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:29.799
Anyone here?

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:32.200
Here he comes.

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:35.039
Coming.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.799
I heard someone say that your antiques
are absolutely genuine.

00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:42.440
Yes.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.400
It's obvious to the trained eye.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.240
This is a beautiful vase
from Longquan Kiln.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:47.720
It should come as a pair, right?

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:50.039
The matching one is in our storeroom.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:51.039
I'm taking

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:51.720
both of them.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.680
Just name

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:53.359
your price.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:54.440
No problem.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.610
Let me take the other one out.

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:12.440
Market Lord.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.960
What are you looking at?

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.480
Look at this Forgetting Tree.

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:21.160
It only sheds leaves

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.839
and never grows new ones.

00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:25.440
Those who come and leave
Tianguang Market

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:27.640
never left anything here.

00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:29.799
Who knows,

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.720
everything in Tianguang Market

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.799
is just a dream.

00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:38.119
Chu Qiu.

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:40.720
How long have I been
in Tianguang Market?

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.480
Market Lord, have you forgotten?

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.519
In Tianguang Market,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.500
the concept of time doesn't exist.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.400
Yes.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.720
How could I forget?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.960
This place is a pool of stagnant water.

00:18:57.319 --> 00:18:58.680
No time flows.

00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:01.160
The seasons never change.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.599
No festivals to be had.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.519
How long has it been since I celebrated

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:12.880
festivals with my parents as a child?

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.519
Market Lord.

00:19:16.599 --> 00:19:19.000
Have you dreamed of
your parents again lately?

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.160
I dreamed of

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:29.480
playing firecrackers with everyone.

00:19:30.759 --> 00:19:32.680
The firecrackers were loud and exciting.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.519
I was happily playing on a swing.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.599
It felt as if I wouldn't mind
if things remained like that,

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:43.160
because there would be

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.640
many more good days
like that in the future.

00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:55.319
Unlike now,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.720
I have no hope

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.359
or desire for the future.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.599
Market Lord.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.000
Your guests are coming soon.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.160
Time to go back.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.980
(Luoxia Manor)

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:30.440
Market Lord, morning.

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:33.200
I know it's impossible
to tell the time here,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.079
but we had so much fun last time, right?

00:20:35.079 --> 00:20:37.120
This time, let's have another
300 rounds of poker.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:37.599
Well?

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.839
The Market Lord is feeling down today.

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:44.720
I hope you can mind...

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:46.519
your words.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.519
Very well.

00:20:47.519 --> 00:20:48.400
Understood.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.759
Take it.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.079
Thank you, Market Lord.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.860
(Liubo Chess, 1920,
Rain Manor in Yuzhou)

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:06.880
What's wrong?

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:08.079
This place...

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.400
It's a little troublesome.

00:21:10.759 --> 00:21:11.559
You've been there?

00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:15.079
Market Lord, is there any other way

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.480
to acquire this chess set?

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:17.319
No.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.590
It took me a long time
to find this myself.

00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:21.039
Market Lord.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.759
Are you

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.480
tired of playing poker?

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.200
Market Lord, are you deprived
of something you desire?

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.880
You can tell me.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.119
What I want
is not something you can give.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.590
Market Lord wants
to celebrate a festival.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.759
Festival?

00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:40.839
She feels like there's nothing

00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:41.880
to look forward to.

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:43.519
Chu Qiu.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.599
Why do you always make things
sound worse than it is?

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.079
A festival, huh?

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.799
And I thought it's something serious.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.559
Since time doesn't exist here,
that makes it more convenient.

00:21:54.759 --> 00:21:56.759
You can choose to celebrate any festival

00:21:56.759 --> 00:21:57.559
without waiting.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.920
You seem to make sense.

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:04.359
Who said you can't have festivals
in Tianguang Market?

00:22:04.839 --> 00:22:06.279
Think out of the box.

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:08.119
How about this?

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:09.200
As payment,

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.240
I want Butler Su to stay with me.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.839
He seems to be a witty guy.

00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:14.200
You'll need to ask him.

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:16.880
I'm not a butler.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.039
Fine,

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:18.880
I'm just joking.

00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:21.839
So, as payment for my services,
you need to celebrate with me.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.160
But,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.759
what festival should we have?

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:25.640
Market Lord,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.039
do you have a Liubo Chess set?

00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:29.359
Liubo Chess?

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:31.359
Didn't I just give you a lead?

00:22:31.359 --> 00:22:33.759
No, I mean, you can use it for divination.

00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:35.359
We can choose a festival from there.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.720
Well...

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.680
The closest one is...

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.319
the Cold Food Festival.

00:22:55.799 --> 00:22:57.160
That sounds so cold.

00:22:58.319 --> 00:22:59.119
I don't want that.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.000
But it's still

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.400
worth celebrating.

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:05.680
We can have games like the jianzi

00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:06.440
and soccer.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.340
If there's enough people,
we can form a circle.

00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:10.200
It's exciting, and not cold at all.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.960
You can also serve qingtuan
during the festival.

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:15.720
My grandmother used to make
the best qingtuan.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.559
I'll bring some over next time.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.359
I promise.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.079
I'll bring one of every flavor.

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:20.799
Deal.

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:21.880
Okay, it's a promise.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:22.759
By the way,

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:24.680
about the Liubo Chess you asked for,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.200
if you go there directly,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.680
it can pose some issues.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.759
Since you're planning a festival for me,

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:31.240
pretty me shall give you

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.079
a useful tip.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.559
Bizhi, come here.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.400
Okay.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400
One for me, boss.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.599
Okay, no problem.

00:23:56.759 --> 00:23:57.960
Is that magazine new?

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.039
It just arrived today.

00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:00.119
I'll take one.

00:24:00.119 --> 00:24:00.519
Sure.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.200
Here.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.400
Thank you.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.799
If not for Wu Yunong,

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:06.759
I wouldn't come here.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.119
That's a lot of people.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.039
How long has Wu Yunong vanished

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.240
since she got married?

00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:13.640
Years, I think.

00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:15.000
Look at the crowd, though.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.359
The stage queen is back,

00:24:16.359 --> 00:24:17.839
and the whole city is gathering here.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.880
I guess she's a superstar of this era.

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:22.839
You can say that.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.720
Welcome.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.960
The stage queen, indeed.

00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:39.319
But

00:24:39.319 --> 00:24:41.839
who's the top fan giving her
so many flowers?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:42.880
Me.

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:44.480
You're her top fan?

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.759
What's a top fan?

00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:47.599
A top fan is

00:24:47.759 --> 00:24:49.480
the fall guy who gives the most gifts.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.400
Here.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.960
Put them here.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.300

Today, I get to stand
on this stage again

00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:30.279
because of your love for me.

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:31.559
Thank you.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.759
Thank you to every one of you.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.599
Today, I'd like to introduce someone.

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:43.599
He's my husband,

00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:45.000
Mr. Wei Zhuoran.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.839
So, that's her husband.

00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:48.960
(Wei Zhuoran)
The doctor who studied overseas.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.980
(Wei Zhuoran)

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.000
What a dashing man!

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.960
A match made in heaven!

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.759
I'm back on stage

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.200
thanks to his understanding and support.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.680
Thank you.

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:10.039
Thank you for the flowers
you sent me today, too.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:10.880
They're gorgeous.

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:11.880
I love them.

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:40.759
Ms. Wu,

00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:42.039
you have guests.

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:42.700
I won't see them.

00:28:42.839 --> 00:28:45.039
It was them who gave you the flowers.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.799
Everyone, leave.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.759
Ms. Wu.

00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:07.680
You are?

00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:09.240
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.960
You truly live up to the name
of the stage queen.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.960
How should I address you.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.319
I'm Bizhi,

00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:20.160
Su Beilu.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:21.799
Have a seat.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.440
Thank you.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.359
Tea, please.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:30.880
Today, we're here

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.359
to ask you a favor.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.519
You two are my supporters,

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:36.920
and you have my gratitude.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.680
Whatever you need,
I will do my best to help.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.799
Do tell.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.400
I'll get straight to the point.

00:29:42.599 --> 00:29:44.240
We need to meet Elder Yu.

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:45.559
Elder Yu?

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.519
Yes.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.559
I know you're like a daughter to him,

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.480
so we have come to ask for your help.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.720
Elder Yu

00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:56.279
has been seclusive
for the past few years.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.680
Even I haven't seen him
for quite some time.

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.920
Is there any way to contact him?

00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:03.720
I've tried all means possible,

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.640
but none has succeeded.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.279
That's why we need your help.

00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:08.640
To be honest,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.039
even if you can reach him,

00:30:10.039 --> 00:30:11.279
he may not want to meet you.

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:12.839
I heard that lately,

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.599
other than his caretakers,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.400
he doesn't talk to anyone.

00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:19.759
Also, I heard that his temper
is getting worse.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.160
If you contact him suddenly,

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.799
he might get angry.

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:24.960
I'm afraid you've made

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.759
a difficult request.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.839
Then, please pass a message
on my behalf.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.079
"When shall we trim
the candle wicks again?"

00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:33.359
Just this,

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.359
and nothing else.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.200
Well,

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:40.559
I'll try.

00:30:41.559 --> 00:30:42.039
Thank you.

00:30:42.319 --> 00:30:43.279
One moment, please.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.920
Elder Yu...

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.720
Is that the guy in the photo?

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.480
Is he fierce?

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.640
Why does she seem troubled?

00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:01.480
You'll know once you meet him.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.000
I didn't know

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.720
you're old friends with Elder Yu.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:16.740
Elder Yu said

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.500
he'll be holding a banquet in Rain Manor
on the Double Ninth Festival.

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:22.119
You are both invited to join
at Shen hour.

00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:23.039
Great.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:23.880
Thank you.

00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:24.690
You're welcome.

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:25.440
See you there.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.039
Well,

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.000
you're going too?

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:28.599
Yes.

00:31:28.759 --> 00:31:30.640
Elder Yu said he's been
meaning to invite me,

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:32.920
but the invitation card got sent
to my old address.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200
I see.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.359
We shall not disturb you
any longer, Ms. Wu.

00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:37.160
Farewell.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.720
See you.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.759
You didn't tell me
how crappy this car is.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.359
Now...

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:08.200
It's broken down just like that.

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:10.519
Can we still get to Rain Manor in time?

00:32:11.319 --> 00:32:11.799
Bizhi,

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.960
can we walk there?

00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:15.839
If you don't mind, go ahead.

00:32:16.319 --> 00:32:18.319
I'll be waiting for a ride here.

00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:20.720
We'll pick you up on the way.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.400
Go.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.559
Fix it quickly, then.

00:32:28.039 --> 00:32:28.599
Stop!

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.279
Stop!

00:32:36.519 --> 00:32:37.240
Hello, sir.

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:38.599
Our car just broke down.

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:40.000
If it's convenient for you,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.559
can you give us a ride to Rain Manor?

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.790
You're going to Rain Manor too?

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.839
You too?

00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:44.319
Yes.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.559
(Pan Yunzhe)
Let's go together.

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:46.519
(Pan Yunzhe)
Elder Yu would be delighted

00:32:46.599 --> 00:32:47.440
(Pan Yunzhe)
to see everyone arriving on time.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.200
Thank you.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.720
Bizhi,

00:32:50.079 --> 00:32:51.240
we got a ride.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.119
Quick.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.160
Gentlemen.

00:33:00.599 --> 00:33:01.519
(Pan Jingting)
This is my father.

00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:05.039
Hello, sir.

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:05.720
Nice to meet you.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.900
(Rain Manor)

00:33:46.119 --> 00:33:46.920
Mr. Pan.

00:33:47.319 --> 00:33:48.000
Ms. Wu.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.960
Long time no see.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.599
You look better than ever.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.400
Come on.

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:54.480
You didn't even attend my performance.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.720
You already have a handsome

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.119
husband,

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:00.920
so you won't have time for me.

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:03.279
Elder Pan.

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:04.000
Hello.

00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:05.200
Ms. Wu.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.319
We meet again.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.000
Thank you for coming that night.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.679
It's nothing.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.500
Thank you for your help too, Ms. Wu.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:13.519
This is my husband.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.599
Wei Zhuoran.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.480
Bizhi.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.559
Su Beilu.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.639
Do you know each other?

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:21.360
We've met.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.199
It's the Hong brothers.

00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:29.119
Chi.

00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:30.800
Lie.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.199
Allow me to introduce these two.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.320
They are the sons of Elder Yu's cousin,

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.840
and leaders of the biggest
martial arts center in the region,

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.719
Hong Martial Arts Center.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.599
Hong Lie.

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:42.760
Hong Chi.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.480
(Hong Chi, Hong Lie)

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.119
(Hong Chi, Hong Lie)
You flatter me.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.320
My brother Hong Lie

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.960
is the sole leader of the center.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.000
I'm not capable enough to do that.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.719
Nice to meet you.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.480
Master Hong.

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:55.280
How did you two get to know Mr. Pan?

00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:57.880
We met on the way here.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.360
He gave us a ride.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.840
You just met each other?

00:35:02.599 --> 00:35:04.280
I must introduce them to you, then.

00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:07.239
This is Yunzhe's father,

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:09.400
the Textile King, Pan Jingting.

00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:11.119
He's an old friend of Elder Yu.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.280
The most charming gentleman here

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.239
has to be Yunzhe.

00:35:15.519 --> 00:35:17.079
Wherever he goes,

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:18.119
you won't see a cold crowd.

00:35:18.159 --> 00:35:19.119
Right, Ms. Wu?

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.159
Rain Manor.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.159
It's been years since we last came.

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:26.880
Yes.

00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:30.760
It's been years since I last saw him.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.159
I hope he's doing fine.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.639
Elder Yu

00:35:39.199 --> 00:35:40.639
hasn't forgotten us, has he?

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.220
(Rain Manor)

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.540
(Elder Yu)

00:36:40.519 --> 00:36:41.639
Xiuyun.

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:45.480
(Memorial Tablet of Yu Xiuyun)
It's your birthday.

00:36:46.519 --> 00:36:49.360
Daddy will make sure that your murderers

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.039
will receive their due punishment.

00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:59.060
