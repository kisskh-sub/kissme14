00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.212
Hey, can you keep it down?

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.553
I told you to keep it down.

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:35.807
-Hey.
-Keep it down, okay?

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.184
Your sister has homework.

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:44.399
Making progress?

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:46.276
-Yeah.
-Mom.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:47.944
-It's written really well.
-Really?

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:49.946
Yeah, it's very neat.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:54.784
My parents always sided
with my elder sister.

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:58.329
I'm home.

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:06.921
They're not the biggest agency,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:10.133
but many of their talents
are in dramas and magazines.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:14.012
They said I could be on TV
if I worked hard and took lessons.

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:15.722
Are you being serious?

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:19.475
I am. I'm going to quit school
and move to Tokyo soon.

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:21.477
Don't be foolish.

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:23.730
It's not going to be that easy.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.107
What do you mean, "foolish?"

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.736
At least go to college first.

00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:35.909
Riko.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.411
I'm not the same as you.

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:42.081
I'll live my life my own way!

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:44.751
Hey, wait. Riko!

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.847
I wanted to make my family accept me.

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:06.481
After defying my parents' wishes,
I found myself breathing the Tokyo air,

00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:09.859
which was murky and full of exhaust fumes.

00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:14.155
But to me, it was the smell of freedom.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:16.783
A smell I didn't have back home.

00:02:18.618 --> 00:02:20.245
Here we are.

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:22.664
Feel free to use the slippers.

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:26.709
This one was built 50 years ago.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.381
And it's far from the station
with no automatic lock on the door,

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:34.467
so it's not the best place
for a woman to live alone.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.429
But considering your budget,
this is about what you can get.

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:44.560
Everything related to water usage
should be relatively new, though.

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:53.111
But if I recall, the water heater
for the bath is an older model.

00:02:58.741 --> 00:02:59.993
I'll take it.

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:02.245
MK PROMOTION

00:03:02.328 --> 00:03:03.871
This will be your stage name.

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:05.790
Risa Hirayama.

00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:08.501
You'll have to pass
the trial period first, though.

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:10.795
Your lessons will cost 30,000 yen monthly.

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:16.551
Whether you get officially signed on
with us will depend on your performance.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.180
Sorry, I was told my lesson fees
would be covered for me.

00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:24.517
Oh, that's only
after you are officially signed on.

00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:28.813
Is that okay?

00:03:30.023 --> 00:03:31.607
Yes, I understand.

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:32.775
Good.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.992
I started part-time work
to cover my lesson fees.

00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:44.037
Ms. Hirata, restock the drinks after that.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.038
Okay.

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:48.499
I genuinely believed
what my manager told me.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.460
Ready? Start.

00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:53.963
Don't you get why Yuu feels so sad?

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:56.507
Stop. You don't have to fight over this.

00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:57.467
This is important.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.595
How would I get it?
She just randomly started crying.

00:04:00.678 --> 00:04:01.471
That's why you--

00:04:01.554 --> 00:04:04.015
-Ms. Hirayama, put more emotion in it.
-Okay.

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:08.603
Unfortunately, we will not be
signing you on this time either.

00:04:09.812 --> 00:04:10.938
I see.

00:04:11.606 --> 00:04:13.149
But you're really close.

00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:16.152
How about you keep
taking lessons a little longer?

00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:20.239
Look, it's not just me.

00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:23.534
Others in the agency agree
there's something special about you!

00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:27.622
Let's keep trying.

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:32.168
Okay, I will.

00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:36.214
Also, the lesson fees will go up
by 5,000 to 35,000 yen from this month.

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:38.800
-Sorry?
-Hope it's not an issue.

00:04:38.883 --> 00:04:40.259
Please sign here.

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:43.137
Right here.

00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:46.599
Okay.

00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:53.272
Thinking back on it now,

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:58.111
I'm sure he must have said the same thing
to dozens or even hundreds of people.

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:02.740
Hey, can you man the register?

00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:03.658
Coming.

00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:06.828
And yet,
all I could do was trust his words.

00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:08.121
Sorry for the wait.

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:11.874
-Stay away!
-Stop.

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.251
Don't do it!

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:14.836
This doesn't concern you two.

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.672
Do you have any idea how I feel?
How could you?

00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:20.925
-Let's switch now.
-Okay.

00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:30.852
Stay away. This doesn't concern you two.

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:31.769
RIKO HIRATA

00:05:38.818 --> 00:05:41.821
Before I knew it, three years had gone by.

00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:51.330
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:56.169
NEXT STAR AUDITION 2020

00:06:00.548 --> 00:06:04.051
CEO, YOKO KODAMA
WE WANT TO UNCOVER YOUR UNIQUE TALENT

00:06:06.512 --> 00:06:08.514
I decided to bet everything on it.

00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:14.562
The Kodama Productions
Next Star Audition 2020.

00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:18.816
The winner of this
tournament-style audition

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.445
will be officially signed on
with Kodama Productions,

00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:27.241
and be awarded a lead role in a movie.

00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:30.119
I thought of it as my last chance.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.331
One, and two, and three, and four.

00:06:33.414 --> 00:06:35.791
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:37.919
One, two, three, four.

00:06:38.002 --> 00:06:39.837
Looking good, Ms. Hara!

00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:42.590
Ms. Hirasawa, you're falling behind.

00:06:42.673 --> 00:06:48.638
Four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, and four, and five.

00:06:49.263 --> 00:06:51.474
-Hello there.
-Oh, hello.

00:06:52.934 --> 00:06:54.185
Hi there.

00:06:56.354 --> 00:06:57.438
Hello.

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:02.068
-Thank you. Good luck.
-Thank you.

00:07:02.944 --> 00:07:04.153
Ms. Hirayama?

00:07:04.237 --> 00:07:05.947
-Yes?
-I'd like a comment.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.448
What is it that drives you?

00:07:08.074 --> 00:07:08.908
Right.

00:07:10.034 --> 00:07:13.663
I left my home against my parents' wishes.

00:07:14.372 --> 00:07:16.457
I know they must be worried,

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:19.710
so I want to put them at ease
by showing some results.

00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:31.764
"Say something."

00:07:31.847 --> 00:07:34.225
"Do you know how precious it was to me?"

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:37.770
"It's a treasure from…"

00:07:37.853 --> 00:07:40.815
"It's a treasure I received
from someone dear to me."

00:07:41.524 --> 00:07:44.360
"It's a treasure I received
from someone dear to me."

00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:50.700
"What's with that attitude?
Say something."

00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:52.868
"Do you know how precious it was to me?"

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:55.496
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.376
I wanted more time to practice,
so I started work as a hostess.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:02.628
You're a heavy drinker, huh?

00:08:02.712 --> 00:08:03.629
Go for one more?

00:08:03.713 --> 00:08:05.548
-Sure.
-I'd love to.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.801
We've kept you waiting long enough.

00:08:08.884 --> 00:08:13.264
Now, we'll announce the winner
who passed the final review.

00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:23.232
The winner of the Kodama Productions
Next Star Audition 2020 is…

00:08:29.947 --> 00:08:31.532
Ms. Yuri Hara!

00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:33.034
Congratulations!

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:38.372
Come to the center of the stage.

00:08:42.668 --> 00:08:44.337
It was my last chance.

00:08:45.463 --> 00:08:46.714
-Did you hear?
-What?

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:48.382
That the audition was rigged.

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:49.383
Seriously?

00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:53.888
Apparently, the agency did it
to get publicity for their talent's debut.

00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:56.682
I guess it's all about who you know, huh?

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.499
And it was then of all times…

00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:23.125
LANTERN FOR THE DEPARTED

00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:24.418
He was still so young.

00:09:26.128 --> 00:09:27.838
I feel sorry for the wife.

00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:22.184
Why didn't you come?

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:54.675
HEY, IT'S MARIKA

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:57.636
WANT TO GET DRINKS WITH
HIDETA ASO FROM KODAMA PRODUCTIONS?

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.888
GOOD NETWORKING CHANCE!

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:04.935
Try it sometime.

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:07.980
-Can you keep going?
-Of course. We just got started.

00:11:09.398 --> 00:11:11.400
You're good with your drinks, I see.

00:11:11.484 --> 00:11:12.693
I like that.

00:11:12.776 --> 00:11:14.737
-So, where are you from?
-Kyoto.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.113
Wait, me too!

00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:17.698
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:21.327
-Not just trying to hit on her?
-No, I'm being for real right now.

00:11:31.504 --> 00:11:34.423
SORRY, SOMETHING CAME UP,
SO I CAN'T MAKE IT.

00:11:45.017 --> 00:11:46.060
Enjoying yourself?

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:47.895
Mr. Aso.

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:49.522
Are you alone?

00:11:50.189 --> 00:11:51.190
Care to join me?

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:53.442
Yes.

00:11:56.737 --> 00:12:00.032
So you quit high school
and moved to Tokyo alone?

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:01.867
Yes.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.580
My parents opposed it,
so I basically ran away from home.

00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:10.918
But things haven't gone well since then.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.051
I actually took an audition
for your agency recently.

00:12:19.134 --> 00:12:20.386
For us?

00:12:20.469 --> 00:12:21.387
Yes.

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:25.224
But I didn't make it past the final stage.

00:12:26.642 --> 00:12:31.647
I decided to come here today
because I thought I could get to meet you,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.984
and ask what you think I'm lacking.

00:12:37.152 --> 00:12:39.905
Maybe the judges just lacked taste.

00:12:42.408 --> 00:12:44.702
You have a lot of charm, if you ask me.

00:12:47.955 --> 00:12:50.249
I can hear you out if you want.

00:12:52.334 --> 00:12:53.794
Will you really?

00:12:53.877 --> 00:12:57.214
Mr. Aso, we'll be leaving first then.

00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:00.092
Thank you.

00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:01.385
Take care.

00:13:01.468 --> 00:13:02.636
See you again.

00:13:07.057 --> 00:13:08.350
How about another drink?

00:13:09.351 --> 00:13:10.227
What?

00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:11.895
Or will you go home?

00:13:13.564 --> 00:13:14.690
I'm fine either way.

00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:18.611
How about it?

00:13:20.904 --> 00:13:23.949
I'll stay. I want to talk more with you.

00:13:25.284 --> 00:13:26.201
Come with me then.

00:13:56.732 --> 00:13:58.067
Thank you.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.068
Cheers.

00:13:59.151 --> 00:14:00.027
Cheers.

00:14:10.663 --> 00:14:11.664
Here.

00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:13.123
Thank you.

00:14:38.023 --> 00:14:40.818
Sorry, I think I drank too much.

00:14:49.243 --> 00:14:51.620
Wait. Stop it!

00:14:51.704 --> 00:14:53.372
That hurt.

00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:57.584
I'm sorry. But that's not why I…

00:14:57.668 --> 00:14:58.877
Just leave then.

00:15:01.588 --> 00:15:04.008
If that's the extent of your resolve.

00:15:11.056 --> 00:15:12.349
Just kidding.

00:15:13.392 --> 00:15:16.228
I'm willing to help you out, you know.

00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:19.273
I can connect you to the right people.

00:15:55.726 --> 00:15:57.895
I'm leaving first, okay?

00:15:57.978 --> 00:15:59.438
Have a shoot to get to.

00:16:01.065 --> 00:16:02.733
Here's your taxi fare.

00:16:03.442 --> 00:16:04.485
Bye.

00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:10.449
Goodbye.

00:16:18.165 --> 00:16:19.792
"Goodbye"?

00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:05.963
I'm fine.

00:17:09.967 --> 00:17:10.926
I'm fine.

00:17:15.347 --> 00:17:16.473
I'm fine.

00:17:20.727 --> 00:17:21.770
I'm fine…

00:17:23.605 --> 00:17:25.774
I'm fine.

00:17:30.904 --> 00:17:34.199
Over and over, I tried to convince myself.

00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:35.242
I'm fine.

00:17:36.285 --> 00:17:37.327
I'm fine.

00:17:39.037 --> 00:17:42.499
If I didn't do so, I thought I might snap.

00:17:44.293 --> 00:17:48.672
In the end, neither Aso nor
Kodama Productions ever contacted me.

00:17:50.048 --> 00:17:51.758
I had to face the reality.

00:17:55.721 --> 00:17:56.722
I was…

00:17:58.056 --> 00:18:02.269
My dream was taken advantage of.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.982
I was just used by him…

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.236
as an outlet for his sexual desires.

00:18:13.238 --> 00:18:16.408
That was five years ago.

00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:21.413
Let's take a break.

00:18:22.623 --> 00:18:24.124
Please let me continue.

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:26.627
-But--
-I want to tell you.

00:18:27.294 --> 00:18:28.337
All of it.

00:18:30.839 --> 00:18:32.799
Tell me if it gets too much.

00:18:36.637 --> 00:18:38.722
Did you ask anyone for help?

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:44.811
I told my agency about it,
and they let me go the next day.

00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:46.313
What?

00:18:46.939 --> 00:18:48.190
My manager said,

00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:52.945
"Don't drag us into this. We don't want
any issues with Kodama Productions."

00:18:53.028 --> 00:18:54.321
As he yelled at me.

00:18:56.156 --> 00:19:00.410
"Sexual assault? You just tried
to seduce him and failed, didn't you?"

00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:04.873
I thought, "Oh, I see."

00:19:05.582 --> 00:19:07.626
"I guess that wasn't sexual assault."

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.380
"It's just an excuse
that I couldn't fight back."

00:19:11.463 --> 00:19:14.174
"It was my fault for going to the party

00:19:14.258 --> 00:19:18.971
and trying to get close to him,
so I could get more work."

00:19:20.347 --> 00:19:22.140
"It was all my fault."

00:19:22.224 --> 00:19:23.392
"I deserved it."

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.478
"So there was nothing to be done."

00:19:28.522 --> 00:19:29.898
Did you try the police?

00:19:32.818 --> 00:19:33.777
I couldn't.

00:19:34.945 --> 00:19:36.738
I thought they wouldn't bother.

00:19:40.075 --> 00:19:46.248
But as time went on,
I started to feel detached from it.

00:19:47.165 --> 00:19:51.044
It started to feel less real,
almost like it was a bad dream.

00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:54.381
What was I fussing over?

00:19:55.007 --> 00:19:56.883
I'm totally fine now.

00:20:00.095 --> 00:20:03.056
I probably looked normal to others.

00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:08.395
But for that entire period,

00:20:09.229 --> 00:20:13.442
I wasn't even sure
whether I was alive or dead.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.530
Everything felt so dull,
no matter what I did.

00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:20.824
-That'll be 2,700 yen.
-Okay.

00:20:22.826 --> 00:20:27.456
I tried to maintain
a sense of normalcy on the outside.

00:20:28.957 --> 00:20:32.461
I would remember
that day less and less often.

00:20:33.462 --> 00:20:35.088
To a secure future.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.341
However…

00:20:39.426 --> 00:20:43.805
I hadn't gotten over it even a little bit.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.397
We want to protect your smile
and the smiles of those dear to you.

00:20:54.107 --> 00:20:56.526
Japan Sanwa Insurance.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:03.658
Why did I, the victim, have to suffer,
while he, the assailant, gets to smile?

00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:10.290
At that moment,
I felt immense rage for the first time.

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:13.919
I can't forgive him.

00:21:14.002 --> 00:21:15.337
I refuse to.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.051
As long as he stays in the limelight,

00:21:21.134 --> 00:21:25.222
until he is judged for his sins
and forced out of this industry,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.770
I will never be able
to regain control of my life.

00:21:35.148 --> 00:21:36.691
That's why you went to Buncho?

00:21:37.651 --> 00:21:41.321
Weekly Buncho covered many scandals
in the entertainment industry,

00:21:41.405 --> 00:21:43.573
so I thought they'd publish it.

00:21:45.242 --> 00:21:48.370
Though I didn't know
you were a reporter for them.

00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:54.042
But that article
was ultimately suppressed.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.336
After that,

00:21:57.003 --> 00:22:01.216
someone from Kodama Productions
strongly urged me to settle.

00:22:02.926 --> 00:22:09.182
But now, after meeting you
and hearing what you had to say,

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.189
I've decided I don't want this
to be settled with money.

00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:20.902
I want him to atone.

00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:23.572
I want him to apologize.

00:22:23.655 --> 00:22:26.199
I want to expose all his wrongdoings!

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.665
Is that strange of me?
After all this time?

00:22:36.209 --> 00:22:37.460
It's not.

00:22:40.088 --> 00:22:41.464
It's not strange at all.

00:22:47.304 --> 00:22:49.806
Have you ever heard of dissociation?

00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:53.101
Victims of sexual assault
distance themselves

00:22:53.185 --> 00:22:58.398
from what happened to them in order
to protect themselves from the trauma.

00:22:59.941 --> 00:23:04.529
I think you did so as well.
To keep yourself sane all this time.

00:23:06.114 --> 00:23:10.160
And after spending a long time
coming to terms with the facts,

00:23:10.243 --> 00:23:14.539
you finally recognized the anger
that was inside you all along.

00:23:15.373 --> 00:23:18.418
But I'm the one who made the choice to go.

00:23:19.628 --> 00:23:21.588
It was absolutely not your fault.

00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:26.968
Aso abused his superior status
in the entertainment industry

00:23:27.052 --> 00:23:29.930
and took advantage of your aspiration.

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:32.682
And you were alone
with him in a private room.

00:23:33.391 --> 00:23:35.268
It would've been tough to resist.

00:23:38.355 --> 00:23:40.815
When he said, "Just leave then,"

00:23:42.025 --> 00:23:44.152
I thought if I defied him,

00:23:44.236 --> 00:23:48.156
I wouldn't be able
to stay in the industry anymore.

00:23:49.241 --> 00:23:51.826
I couldn't go against him
when I thought of that.

00:23:53.662 --> 00:23:57.749
What Aso did
was undeniably sexual assault.

00:23:59.334 --> 00:24:01.962
There's no need for you to blame yourself.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.466
No one's ever…

00:24:07.717 --> 00:24:09.594
said that to me before.

00:24:13.765 --> 00:24:17.143
I'll try one more time
to make this into an article.

00:24:20.939 --> 00:24:21.815
The problem is,

00:24:22.524 --> 00:24:28.071
even if we keep your identity hidden,
people will likely slander you anyway.

00:24:28.154 --> 00:24:32.784
Of course, we'll do our utmost
to ensure you can't be identified.

00:24:33.702 --> 00:24:34.953
I understand.

00:24:35.036 --> 00:24:39.332
Also, I can't write an article based
on just the information you've provided.

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:41.918
I need other sources.

00:24:42.002 --> 00:24:45.171
Why? Do you think I'm lying too?

00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:47.007
I trust you, Riko.

00:24:49.217 --> 00:24:54.055
But the public won't
just take your word for it.

00:24:55.598 --> 00:24:58.810
"Where's the proof?
Did she just fabricate it?"

00:24:59.686 --> 00:25:02.022
They'll be sure to respond with scrutiny.

00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:07.569
Not to mention, Kodama Productions
and Aso will most likely respond too.

00:25:09.988 --> 00:25:13.450
So we have to get the accounts
of the other people at the party,

00:25:13.533 --> 00:25:15.910
and build our case
with supporting evidence.

00:25:17.787 --> 00:25:19.622
It'll take some time.

00:25:20.332 --> 00:25:25.128
So I need you to be patient
and keep all this a secret.

00:25:26.463 --> 00:25:27.297
Okay.

00:25:34.637 --> 00:25:35.889
I'm grateful…

00:25:38.224 --> 00:25:39.267
that you told me.

00:26:14.552 --> 00:26:16.137
I'll see her home.

00:26:17.514 --> 00:26:20.725
Let me know when you pin down
the participants of that party

00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:22.644
and need to get in touch with them.

00:26:22.727 --> 00:26:24.979
I'll help as much as I'm able.

00:26:25.063 --> 00:26:26.523
I appreciate it.

00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:27.941
Bye then.

00:26:39.577 --> 00:26:40.620
Ms. Saki!

00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:44.040
Can you come with me?

00:26:44.124 --> 00:26:44.999
Sure.

00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:04.227
Over here.

00:27:05.061 --> 00:27:07.730
-Good work.
-Hello.

00:27:10.984 --> 00:27:16.364
About that online drama, Mr. Fujiwara
is now officially a part of it!

00:27:17.449 --> 00:27:18.783
Really?

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:20.160
That's great.

00:27:23.621 --> 00:27:26.624
Chief, you don't look very excited.

00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:28.501
You can look a little happier.

00:27:28.585 --> 00:27:30.545
Mori worked hard for this.

00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:32.922
You're right.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:34.424
Good job, Mori.

00:27:35.508 --> 00:27:36.509
Thank you.

00:27:37.802 --> 00:27:42.182
Ms. Yoko won't try to sabotage me again,
will she?

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.310
It'll be fine.

00:27:46.728 --> 00:27:49.355
I won't let Kodama Pro do as they please.

00:27:50.273 --> 00:27:54.444
Let's put a stop to this absurd injustice.

00:27:57.071 --> 00:28:00.450
It's just as Hashimoto,
the editor-in-chief, told us.

00:28:01.451 --> 00:28:03.244
I hardly believed it at first.

00:28:06.956 --> 00:28:10.793
You mean Ioka is also involved in this?

00:28:12.212 --> 00:28:13.338
What shall we do?

00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:17.342
Given that she's in contact
with Ioka and the reporter from Buncho,

00:28:17.425 --> 00:28:19.677
she likely won't agree to settle.

00:28:21.554 --> 00:28:26.017
As long as Mr. Hashimoto is on our side,
Weekly Buncho won't publish their article.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.855
However, we should make
our move sooner rather than later.

00:28:44.035 --> 00:28:45.328
Mr. Kondo?

00:28:46.454 --> 00:28:49.833
I need your help with something.

00:29:13.731 --> 00:29:14.858
Ninomiya.

00:29:18.152 --> 00:29:19.237
Can we talk?

00:29:26.995 --> 00:29:31.082
I talked to the victim
in the Aso sexual assault story.

00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:36.546
I plan to write an article on it.

00:29:36.629 --> 00:29:38.131
You're still on that?

00:29:38.214 --> 00:29:40.675
You'll never get it published
in Weekly Buncho.

00:29:40.758 --> 00:29:43.261
That's why I need your help.

00:29:43.928 --> 00:29:47.181
Find a publisher that won't bow to
Kodama Productions.

00:29:47.265 --> 00:29:49.726
You have more connections
in the industry than me.

00:29:49.809 --> 00:29:52.395
Don't be ridiculous.
What about my standing?

00:29:53.229 --> 00:29:56.524
What about your standing as a journalist?

00:29:57.233 --> 00:30:02.238
The perpetrator's crimes are covered up,
while the victim is forced to stay quiet.

00:30:02.322 --> 00:30:04.657
Do you really find that acceptable?

00:30:04.741 --> 00:30:06.451
Why are you so invested in this?

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.249
If you're going to get this invested
in strangers, this job's not for you.

00:30:17.503 --> 00:30:19.505
The victim is my little sister.

00:30:24.802 --> 00:30:28.348
I didn't know that
until I actually met her.

00:30:29.682 --> 00:30:32.602
You're saying that girl is…

00:30:38.608 --> 00:30:42.403
You want to write the article
for your sister's sake?

00:30:43.154 --> 00:30:44.030
Yes.

00:30:45.031 --> 00:30:46.616
But that's not all.

00:30:48.618 --> 00:30:53.414
When I learned that she was the victim,
I finally understood.

00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:57.126
The people in news stories
aren't just strangers.

00:30:58.586 --> 00:31:01.798
People dear to us
could become victims at any time.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:09.389
That's why we, as reporters,
have to uncover and publicize the facts.

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:15.228
I should've realized that sooner, huh?

00:32:05.069 --> 00:32:06.612
What's this?

00:32:07.488 --> 00:32:08.406
Can you tell?

00:32:09.657 --> 00:32:11.200
It's a cloud!

00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:14.370
I see that smile.

00:32:15.038 --> 00:32:16.581
-Mirei.
-You're so cute.

00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:20.918
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:32:21.627 --> 00:32:22.754
I haven't forgiven you.

00:32:25.757 --> 00:32:28.843
I just don't want to be known
as the woman who got cheated on

00:32:28.926 --> 00:32:31.429
and had her marriage collapse.

00:32:34.307 --> 00:32:35.433
What is it?

00:32:36.392 --> 00:32:37.810
You're so cute.

00:32:38.436 --> 00:32:40.271
I'll get your food ready, okay?

00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:14.931
Ms. Mori contacted me.

00:33:16.432 --> 00:33:18.726
Said you got a role in an online drama.

00:33:20.686 --> 00:33:21.604
Yeah.

00:33:26.651 --> 00:33:28.236
Work your ass off.

00:33:40.873 --> 00:33:41.874
Also, this.

00:33:43.626 --> 00:33:45.336
It's still a prototype.

00:33:45.419 --> 00:33:49.465
But I'm thinking of starting a new brand
and selling anti-cheating underwear.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.718
You'll model for it, okay?

00:33:56.806 --> 00:33:58.599
You lost me there.

00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:07.275
What's wrong, sweetie?

00:34:07.358 --> 00:34:08.526
What?

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:11.070
You hungry? Let's get some food.

00:34:28.004 --> 00:34:30.256
Are you Riko Hirata?

00:34:32.884 --> 00:34:35.178
I'm Kondo, a freelance journalist.

00:34:38.264 --> 00:34:40.766
You're trying to get
an article published, right?

00:34:42.435 --> 00:34:44.645
About a big-name actor's sexual assault.

00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:48.149
A bunch of people have been
making false accusations,

00:34:48.232 --> 00:34:50.401
trying to get publicity
or settlement money

00:34:50.484 --> 00:34:53.905
by taking advantage of
the recent MeToo Movement.

00:34:53.988 --> 00:34:57.658
I'm writing a special feature
on such cases, which brings me here.

00:34:58.492 --> 00:35:01.370
Are you accusing me of lying?

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:08.628
There are people who saw you arguing
with a member of a major talent agency.

00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:10.379
Over settlement money, they said.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:11.964
That's not--

00:35:12.048 --> 00:35:15.593
You made a false accusation
and demanded settlement money, didn't you?

00:35:16.385 --> 00:35:20.514
But they ignored your demands, so now
you're trying to get an article out.

00:35:20.598 --> 00:35:22.016
Am I wrong?

00:35:22.099 --> 00:35:23.643
That's not true! I'm not--

00:35:23.726 --> 00:35:25.686
You're short on cash, aren't you?

00:35:26.938 --> 00:35:29.482
And you work as a hostess, right?

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.490
Don't record without my permission!

00:35:37.573 --> 00:35:39.033
Come on now.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.162
I'll include this in the article, okay?

00:36:09.313 --> 00:36:10.189
Riko?

00:36:19.156 --> 00:36:22.994
A reporter visited me. Said I'm lying
for publicity and settlement money.

00:36:23.077 --> 00:36:23.911
What?

00:36:23.995 --> 00:36:27.290
If he writes that in an article,
no one will believe me!

00:36:27.373 --> 00:36:30.835
I only told you guys about it.
How did he know?

00:36:30.918 --> 00:36:31.919
Did you tell him?

00:36:32.003 --> 00:36:34.297
Of course not. Calm down.

00:36:35.298 --> 00:36:37.967
I promise I'll find out how this happened.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.010
Okay?

00:36:50.229 --> 00:36:51.939
How's Ms. Riko?

00:36:52.023 --> 00:36:54.608
I told her not to go outside for now.

00:36:54.692 --> 00:36:56.610
She was pretty shaken last night.

00:36:58.029 --> 00:37:00.489
How do you think
they found out about this?

00:37:01.324 --> 00:37:04.035
Only one person knows
I'm investigating this story.

00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:11.459
What do you want?

00:37:12.126 --> 00:37:14.170
Did you tell anyone about my sister?

00:37:15.546 --> 00:37:16.589
What's that about?

00:37:17.256 --> 00:37:19.550
A reporter came to my sister's place.

00:37:20.176 --> 00:37:21.510
Said he'd write an article,

00:37:21.594 --> 00:37:24.889
claiming she's lying about
the assault to get publicity and money.

00:37:25.473 --> 00:37:26.474
-It wasn't me.
-But--

00:37:26.557 --> 00:37:27.433
I swear.

00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:30.144
And also…

00:37:38.444 --> 00:37:41.113
That article's already out.

00:37:41.197 --> 00:37:42.073
What?

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.619
"A former talent, now a hostess,

00:37:46.702 --> 00:37:50.247
falsely accused a famous actor
of sexual assault for settlement money."

00:37:51.582 --> 00:37:53.167
But how…?

00:38:02.843 --> 00:38:04.845
YASUO KONDO, FREELANCE JOURNALIST

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.441
Ma'am!

00:38:19.235 --> 00:38:21.112
IS RISA HIRAYAMA THE MENTIONED TALENT?

00:38:21.946 --> 00:38:23.823
SERIOUSLY? IT'S RISA HIRAYAMA?

00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:25.533
They got us.

00:38:25.616 --> 00:38:30.329
Even if Ms. Riko's article comes out now,
people won't take it at face value.

00:38:30.413 --> 00:38:33.457
You think Kodama Productions
is behind this?

00:38:43.801 --> 00:38:45.219
-Hello.
-Riko?

00:38:46.554 --> 00:38:47.471
What?

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.391
You didn't answer my calls. I was worried.

00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:56.021
About that article,
I'm sorry I couldn't stop it.

00:38:57.356 --> 00:38:59.483
Are you at home? I'll come over.

00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:01.152
Don't.

00:39:01.902 --> 00:39:02.820
But…

00:39:03.571 --> 00:39:05.281
Just don't.

00:39:05.364 --> 00:39:06.699
I'm fine.

00:39:08.284 --> 00:39:10.161
Get some rest, okay?

00:39:10.244 --> 00:39:12.621
We'll think of a countermeasure.

00:39:12.705 --> 00:39:14.123
Call me if anything happens.

00:39:14.707 --> 00:39:15.541
Okay.

00:39:16.792 --> 00:39:17.668
Riko?

00:39:33.517 --> 00:39:34.560
See you tomorrow.

00:39:36.061 --> 00:39:39.106
Hirata, finish the article
for the web edition by tomorrow.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.649
-Okay.
-Thanks.

00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:43.194
Good night.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.760
Good morning.

00:40:08.928 --> 00:40:09.970
Hello.

00:40:12.348 --> 00:40:13.307
Morning.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:18.979
Hello?

00:40:19.647 --> 00:40:21.482
This is Ioka. Did you see it?

00:40:22.149 --> 00:40:22.983
What?

00:40:35.037 --> 00:40:36.664
To Sengawa, please.

00:41:01.564 --> 00:41:03.941
Ms. Riko's post
is getting heavy criticism.

00:41:05.234 --> 00:41:07.528
You should go to her immediately.

00:41:08.445 --> 00:41:09.655
Okay.

00:41:13.993 --> 00:41:20.583
Five years ago,
I was sexually assaulted by Hideta Aso.

00:41:21.875 --> 00:41:26.922
That night, I went to a drinking party
attended by people in the industry.

00:41:27.506 --> 00:41:34.179
In the end, I was left alone with Aso,
and he then assaulted me.

00:41:36.098 --> 00:41:39.018
I've tried to speak out
about it several times,

00:41:39.101 --> 00:41:41.437
but I was silenced every time.

00:41:42.938 --> 00:41:45.983
I was even betrayed
by the people I trusted.

00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:51.780
Everything written
in that article is a complete lie.

00:41:51.864 --> 00:41:53.073
TRASH HUMAN BEING

00:41:53.157 --> 00:41:54.450
Please believe me.

00:41:54.533 --> 00:41:57.244
WHAT A VULGAR WOMAN
I'M DISGUSTED

00:42:01.665 --> 00:42:02.791
Please hurry.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.052
Thank you.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.106
Riko?

00:42:26.774 --> 00:42:27.816
Riko?

00:42:28.734 --> 00:42:29.985
Riko!

00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:45.834
Riko!

00:42:46.335 --> 00:42:47.169
Riko!

00:42:55.552 --> 00:42:56.512
Riko!

00:42:57.554 --> 00:42:58.639
Riko!

00:43:30.212 --> 00:43:33.757
I'm curious what choice he'll make.
Aren't you?

00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:35.551
PREVIEW

00:43:35.634 --> 00:43:37.261
THE FINAL EPISODE

00:43:37.344 --> 00:43:39.722
I haven't changed a bit since then.

00:43:39.805 --> 00:43:42.391
IOKA'S PAST WITH KODAMA BECOMES KNOWN

00:43:42.474 --> 00:43:46.729
Do you really think you can antagonize
Kodama Pro and still get by?

00:43:46.812 --> 00:43:48.147
You monster!

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:49.773
Give my Yuri back!

00:43:49.857 --> 00:43:51.233
THE MYSTERIOUS GIRL YURI HARA

00:43:52.234 --> 00:43:53.569
We need to talk.

00:43:53.652 --> 00:43:56.280
SCATTERED MYSTERIES ARE ALL CONNECTED

00:43:56.363 --> 00:43:58.407
What have you been digging into?

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:00.159
You wrote that article.

00:44:00.242 --> 00:44:02.953
As if you haven't done
the same thing as well.

00:44:03.537 --> 00:44:05.164
Absolutely unbelievable.

00:44:05.247 --> 00:44:06.957
So it's finally time.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.584
I'm counting on you, okay?

00:44:08.667 --> 00:44:10.961
AND THEN, THE FINAL FACE-OFF

00:44:11.044 --> 00:44:12.796
What are you plotting now?

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.508
You've made the wrong decision.
But I'll give you a chance.

00:44:16.592 --> 00:44:19.136
They'll attack her again
with baseless speculations.

00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:20.471
I thought about dying.

00:44:21.096 --> 00:44:22.639
Looks like it went well.

00:44:22.723 --> 00:44:23.932
TO COVER IT UP?

00:44:24.016 --> 00:44:25.893
You think that's acceptable?

00:44:25.976 --> 00:44:29.021
They lost their future
because they were involved with you.

00:44:29.104 --> 00:44:30.314
OR TO EXPOSE?

00:44:30.397 --> 00:44:33.525
We can't let this injustice continue.

00:44:33.609 --> 00:44:37.237
THE FINAL STAGE OF THE OPPOSING SCANDALS

00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:42.993
IOKA AND HIRATA ENTER A FINAL FIGHT
TO BRING THE TRUTH TO LIGHT

00:44:44.661 --> 00:44:48.123
