=Episode 17=

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.039
You've traveled a long way.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.079
We are so blessed.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.200
This rascal

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.719
actually managed
to find a fairy like you.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680
You have no idea

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.959
how he's been acting these years.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.319
He got gray hair so young.

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:17.640
I almost thought he'd become a monk.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.239
That's way too exaggerated.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.400
You brat.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.879
You didn't tell me a thing.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.319
I thought the Xie line
would end with you.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.000
It's fine.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.280
He's thick-skinned.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:32.959
Even if you cut off his flesh,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.200
he wouldn't cry out.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:35.280
What?

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:36.920
Feeling for him already?

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.000
Madam.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.879
Don't you mind that

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.799
I look like...

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.040
The Grand Princess?

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:53.799
Looking like the Grand Princess

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.000
is a blessing many could only dream of.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.319
But people say that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.239
she was a threat to the state.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.000
Pah!

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:05.239
Only fools say that.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.400
The Regent Princess
was second only to His Majesty.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.719
What could Qi offer her?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.280
In my heart,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.759
she is a true heroine.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.840
Mother is right.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.199
These are humble gifts
I've prepared for you, Madam.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.000
I hope you'll like them.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.400
As expected,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.039
girls tend to be more thoughtful.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.120
So pretty.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.120
You're such a pretty girl.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.280
And so well-mannered.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.319
Huaiyong is so lucky.

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.800
Feel at ease

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.000
and stay here for a few days.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.360
Tell me if you need anything.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.919
I'll make sure
everything is perfectly arranged.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:52.360
Alright.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.680
Huaiyong,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.080
aren't you on duty at the palace today?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.439
I'm afraid

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.240
His Majesty is quite occupied today.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.800
The empress must be gone today.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.560
Come again?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.039
Congratulations.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.919
Her Majesty is with child.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960
Is this true?

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.599
We dare not deceive Your Majesty.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.680
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.879
I will take great care of myself

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.840
and give birth to our child.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.400
I respectfully see Your Majesty off.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.439
Watch her closely.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.560
Report any unusual activity.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.439
Have you heard, Prince Mu?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.159
Her Majesty is with child.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.240
Her grounding is lifted.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.000
What?

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.120
My buddy.

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:11.560
Calm down.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.000
Chancellor Huo's daughter
carries the royal heir.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.199
Then what about your deal?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.519
It's been so many years.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.959
Why is she suddenly pregnant?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.920
But you know all her plans.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.399
She won't let you go.

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:29.399
Indeed.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.160
What should I do?

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.319
What should I do?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.920
- Out.
- Out.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.000
What a pity.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.759
I'm just a free-roaming martial artist.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.040
I can't handle such matters.

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:49.360
But

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.360
if Her Majesty couldn't
carry this child to term...

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.360
You want me to kill that child?

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:56.639
- No, no.
- That's not...

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.360
That's not what I meant.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.120
I'm merely concerned for you.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:02.519
Think about it.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:04.040
Who is Chancellor Huo?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.120
He's the man in power,
second only to His Majesty.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.240
But...

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:10.120
if...

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.079
with support

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.360
from the top...

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.279
Come on.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.920
My buddy.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:21.439
Come on.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.759
My buddy.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.800
If we report this to His Majesty,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.120
he will take care of it himself.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.439
Your safety is what matters.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:31.920
Cheers.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.360
I have to go.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:38.319
Go ahead.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.879
This way.

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:57.160
My lord, Chen Can is here.

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.560
W-What do you want?

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.879
I invited Your Highness here

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.920
to reassure you

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.279
that regardless of the gender
of Empress' child,

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:16.800
it will not affect

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.560
our collaboration.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.240
I don't believe it.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.560
That child shares your blood.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.720
Your Highness,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.680
blood ties are the most unreliable.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.600
The Ninth Lord rebelled.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.000
Wasn't Chen Ye blood-related
to the late Emperor?

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:44.639
Yet what happened?

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.079
From ancient times,

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.319
in royal families,

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.160
it's more than common
for fathers and sons,

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:56.800
and brothers to kill each other.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.759
Alliances based on blood tie

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:03.079
face changes at any time.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.360
But those built on shared interests

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.279
are the strongest.

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:11.040
If Your Highness continues to waver,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.360
don't blame me...

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.000
In that case,

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:17.120
I'll trust you.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.959
Good.

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:22.759
From now on, the Huo family

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:25.279
relies entirely on Your Highness.

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.000
Go back there.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.560
Keep watching for me.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.720
Understood.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.360
How could Master do that?

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:43.920
No need to be mad.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.800
He abandoned me,

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:48.079
so I've abandoned him too.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.279
Any progress with the banquet?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.000
Your Majesty,

00:07:54.335 --> 00:07:56.160
invitations went out
to all senior ministers'

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.480
ladies and daughters,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.920
including Xie Fei's fiancée.

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:02.959
Good.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920
When the time comes,

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:09.439
let's enjoy the show.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:13.680
Mother,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.000
Her Majesty

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:19.199
invites you and Yunfei

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.079
to the palace banquet
on the fifteenth next month.

00:08:23.232 --> 00:08:24.639
(Invitation)
Yunfei is invited, too?

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.079
Yes.

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:28.360
Clearly, she's up to no good.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.600
Yunfei, feel free to stay.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.720
I'll explain to Her Majesty
on your behalf.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.919
I should accept your kindness, Madam.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.000
But

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.000
since I have nothing to hide,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.200
I don't mind going.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.320
That's right.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.320
But...

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.960
Be it fortune or misfortune,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.639
I must face it.

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:47.720
Don't worry, Madam. I have a plan.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.679
Yeah, and I'll be there too.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.639
Rest assured,
I won't let them bully you.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.720
Huaiyong,

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.840
prepare some clothing for her

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.879
to attend the banquet.

00:08:58.639 --> 00:08:59.240
Remember.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.600
Make sure the clothing
matches her peerless beauty.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.720
Understood.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.759
Alright.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.440
I'll get the clothes.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.440
Look around.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.357
(Confidential Memorial)

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.840
When I thought you had perished,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.639
these memorials

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.360
saw me through night after night.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.480
No wonder they look

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.000
so worn.

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.320
I didn't know

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.840
you'd be so sentimental, my lord.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.000
Your Highness,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.360
back then, held back by doubts,

00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:38.639
I couldn't voice my love.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.840
Tormented by regret every night,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.799
I lay sleepless.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.279
Fortunately,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
heaven took pity on me

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360
for my sincere remorse,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.600
and granted me another chance.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.879
I won't make the same mistake.

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:06.360
Your Highness,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.559
from the moment I saw you,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.000
you've been
