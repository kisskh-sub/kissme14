00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680
Wuming's been gone for hours now.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.400
Stop being so smitten.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360
You're still young.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.000
You'll understand when you're married.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.200
Speaking of which,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.320
what kind of man

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.880
do you want to marry, Mai Xiang?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.040
Me?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.280
I want someone

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.400
who's obsessive.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.160
He needs that fragile aura,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.080
domineering in public,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.680
but around me,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.360
he must beg for my affection humbly.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.560
And handsome too.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.480
You say I'm smitten?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.680
Seems like someone else here

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.400
is the truly smitten one.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.480
I'm not talking to you!

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.280
Alright,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.200
don't worry.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.560
When it's time for you

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.680
to marry,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.280
I'll find you the perfect husband.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.200
Then I'll prepare a lavish dowry

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.920
to see you wed in style.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.960
That's more like it.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.200
I want a gold bracelet on my left wrist

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.280
and a jade bracelet on my right.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.600
I'll buy ink and brushes for Wuming.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.520
Mind the house.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.760
He needs to be rich.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.680
What bridal sedan should I have?

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.880
An eight-bearer grand...

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.080
Sis!

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.360
Sis!

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280
I'm mad.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.720
That is Mai Tianlin's daughter,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.800
Mr. Qiu.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.480
Girl.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.760
My lord,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.920
how can I help you?

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.080
Are you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.800
Mai Tianlin's daughter?

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.840
Yes.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.480
Girl,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.600
is your father home?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.480
My father?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.720
He isn't home.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.880
He went to gather herbs
in the mountains earlier.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.080
My lord,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.080
would you like to rest inside?

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.520
I can go to the mountains

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.800
to tell him you're here.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.160
No need.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.280
No need.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.400
No need.

00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:13.834
Yes.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.760
What are you doing?

00:04:16.032 --> 00:04:17.520
- Move.
- Why are you arresting me?

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.600
What are you doing?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.720
Let me go!

00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:31.488
(Dried tofu)

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.160
Why did you come?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.720
You're in danger.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.560
You'll put Mai Tian in danger too.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.480
Isn't it you who's putting her
in danger?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.080
As her brother...

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.120
How do you know?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.960
Not your business.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.800
I warned her

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.960
not to tell anyone.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.280
I'm her husband.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.680
Why couldn't she tell me?

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.880
What kind of brother are you?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.920
All these years,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.200
no matter your reasons,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.160
you should visit her

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.440
and let her know you're alive.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.840
How could you bear

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.760
her suffering in that backwater?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.880
Do you even have a heart?

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.880
Circumstances forced it.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.760
It's not your concern.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.080
It is my concern now.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.480
I'm her husband.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.400
I'll protect her for life.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.280
Unlike you,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.880
who only runs from responsibility.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.360
Your marriage was just circumstantial.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.880
Times have changed.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.200
She and I

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.320
are genuine.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.400
I'm her true husband.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.400
And you are unworthy

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.720
of being her brother.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.200
True husband?

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.680
Then how have you protected her?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.720
She's in danger now

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.960
entirely because of you.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.680
It's all because you hid your identity

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.824
and won't acknowledge her,

00:05:49.824 --> 00:05:51.360
so she mistook me for you.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.080
Speaking of this,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.760
why is your jade pendant on me?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.680
Enough nonsense.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.240
(I held back because of Nian,)

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.800
(I didn't make my move.)

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.680
(But now it's urgent.)

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.120
(It's secluded here.)

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.360
(Might as well)

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.560
(eliminate this threat.)

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.280
(Your death)

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.120
(benefits everyone.)

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.440
Zhifeng!

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.480
What are you doing?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.720
It's nothing.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880
We're messing around.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.000
What brings you here?

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.400
If I ever find out

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.160
you've wronged my sister again,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.720
I'll kill you on the spot.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.680
Zhifeng!

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.560
No more talk!

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.280
Hide in the mountains.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.040
Stay hidden.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.280
I'll come find you.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.560
Protect yourselves.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.040
Zhifeng!

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.200
Explain yourself!

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.080
What do you mean?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.760
Let's hide first.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.120
He wouldn't harm us.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.880
Let's go.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.680
I always feel

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.680
he's hiding many secrets.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880
We'll discuss it later.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.600
Let's go.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.480
Who are you really?

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.360
Who do you think I am?

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.160
Shen Zhinian.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.280
Shen Zhinian.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.920
(Is he after Tian?)

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.480
That Shen Jinyuan

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.680
actually had a daughter like you.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.920
I never expected

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.680
to have let you slip through.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.360
From now on, I'll make sure

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.200
to leave no loose ends.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.160
What?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.480
What do you mean?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.880
What did you do to my father?

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.160
Your father?

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.760
Not just your father.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.120
All 17 members of your Shen family

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.000
were slaughtered by me.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.560
Today, it's your turn.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.480
Aren't you afraid of divine punishment?

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.360
Divine punishment?

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.160
Divine punishment?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.120
Then let it come!

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.200
Bah!

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.600
You fool!

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.920
Don't you miss your father?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.040
Very well.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.680
Today, I'll send you

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.440
to reunite

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.760
with your family.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.400
(Tian...)

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.560
(Too bad, you won't see me get married.)

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.200
(Take care of Father for me.)

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.920
Wait!

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.240
What is it?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.680
Mai Xiang and Father don't know yet.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.080
I forgot.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.960
Here's the plan.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.880
I'll find Father.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.720
You find Mai Xiang.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.400
Okay.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.000
Mai Tian,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.800
be careful.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.480
You're late.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.760
Miss summoned me.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.120
That's why I'm delayed.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.520
Is that so?

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.320
Shen Jinyuan's daughter...

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.080
How could I let you live?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.680
Clean this up.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.480
Mai Xiang!

00:10:53.504 --> 00:10:54.790
Mai Xiang...

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.080
Mai Xiang!

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.280
Mai Xiang!

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.400
Wake up, Mai Xiang.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.600
Wake up, Mai Xiang.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.760
You asked me to trust you.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.800
You asked me to trust you.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.080
Then you killed my sister!

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.600
You killed my sister!

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.280
Get out!

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.760
Get out!

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.600
From now on,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.200
I want

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.720
nothing to do

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.280
with you.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.200
Get lost!

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.680
Mai Xiang!

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.000
So beautiful!

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.520
Tian.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.880
Tian!

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.720
Who did it?

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.360
Who did it?

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.480
Mai Xiang!

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.080
Mai Xiang!

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.600
Mai Tian.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.360
Mai Tian.
