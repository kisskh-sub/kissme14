[How did you]

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.360
[end up starving yourself,]

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.280
[I wonder.]

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.400
Dad,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.640
you're unbelievable.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.880
It's all Shi's fault.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.400
He won't let me stay at his place.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.960
So why?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.160
Why did you run away from home?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.680
You can't function without my mom.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.040
Mom takes

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.840
care of everything for you.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.800
Now you're living

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.600
like a homeless man.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.200
This won't do.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.320
Just go home,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.160
okay?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.840
You're right.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.960
Marriage is about

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.640
understanding each other.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.160
Exactly.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.640
And it's the same with you and Yudong.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.440
It's normal for couples to have conflicts.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.480
Sometimes you

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.160
just have to let things slide.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.200
Don't nitpick over

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.800
everything.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.160
Dad, we're talking about you.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.840
How did this become about me?

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.600
Why

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.079
can't I lecture you?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.400
Yudong's a good guy.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.600
He's sacrificed a lot

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.320
for your marriage.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.440
Now he has a career too.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.000
You should support him

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.920
and understand him.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.560
For marriage to stay solid,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.360
both sides have to give

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.800
and make sacrifices.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.640
And honestly,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.800
this is the moment you

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.280
need to give a little.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.600
Whatever you're unhappy about,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.760
you just gotta endure it.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.840
Give? Sacrifice?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.920
I've given plenty.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.800
I haven't said anything,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000
so you don't know about it.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.760
Besides,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.120
this is between us as a couple.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.079
Who's given more,

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:31.960
who's given less,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.520
we know that ourselves.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.960
You don't live with us.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.040
What do you actually know?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.360
Stop meddling.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.560
Just take care of your

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.120
own business.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.840
Go home,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.840
and apologize to Mom.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.760
And make it sincere,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.000
okay?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.120
Alright, let's drop it.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.240
When I get back,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.640
I'll apologize to her.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.600
But

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.600
I'm telling you,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.480
you need to think about what I said.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.960
Okay.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.200
I will.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.440
Pass me that bowl of rice. Where...

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.800
Here, right here.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.200
But you can only have a tiny bit,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.160
or your blood sugar will spike.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.600
No, order me another bowl.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.280
It's not...

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.440
It's already too much.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.800
Your blood sugar will go up again.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.600
Eat some veggies first.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.360
Have the rice later.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.320
Eat the greens.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.160
And those ribs are really greasy.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.000
They taste good.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.800
After we're done eating,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.840
I'll give you some cash.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.240
I know all your money's with Mom.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.560
Do they offer seafood here? I want crab.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.640
[Come on, come on.]

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.960
[You in?]

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.240
[Alright, alright.]

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.800
Got ten rings?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.320
Yeah, ten rings.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.560
Watch me now.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.320
Give me ten rings.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.720
Scan the code there to pay.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.280
You got this!

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.720
Five yuan.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.440
Mr. Zhang?

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.760
Miss, you here to play too?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.400
You don't qualify.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.680
Look, all the players

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.960
are old folks.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.960
You're too young. Go away.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.080
Mr. Zhang,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.400
this is a public area.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.320
Please keep

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.159
the noise down.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.600
Please pause the game for now.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.920
We got complaints from other customers.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.760
We paid.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.960
I paid for this.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.680
You heard what they said.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.680
By the way, Mr. Zhang,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.960
when you have a moment,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.240
please stop by the front desk to

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.440
settle the fees for the past two days.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.800
Miss, see this?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.520
Cash.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.000
You think I won't pay?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.800
No, no.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.800
Let's continue.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.280
Whose turn is it now?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.360
- Don't cross the line.
- Ready, go.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.360
Jianbin,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.680
you picked a great spot.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.600
You bet.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.960
Food, drinks, and a place to stay.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.280
Next time I'll pick a fight with my wife,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.920
I'll just come here.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.600
You?

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.760
No way.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.840
Why not?

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.520
Your wife doesn't like strangers,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.159
and you don't like bathhouses.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.560
You're so petty.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.159
Easy. Don't rush.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.200
- Take your time.
- Aim carefully.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.920
Don't rush.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.480
Aim for the 100-yuan section.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.960
Speak.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.200
[Hey, Mom.]

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.480
[That fight was]

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.600
[totally Dad's fault.]

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.040
[I already talked to him.]

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.120
[I told him to really reflect on it.]

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.560
[If he doesn't,]

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.560
[don't let him come back.]

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.320
[Don't let him in.]

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.960
I wasn't planning to let him come back.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.440
If he comes back, I'm leaving.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.480
[Okay, okay.]

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.480
[Mom, don't be angry.]

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.240
[We were wrong.]

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.400
[But the thing with Yudong and me]

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.480
[is work-related.]

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.800
[P-Please understand,]

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.160
[okay?]

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.400
Stop using work as an excuse.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.240
That's just shameless, you know?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.520
I don't want to see

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.440
any of you right now.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.360
[Aiying, what's up?]

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.360
Staying home alone is boring.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.480
[What?]

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.200
[What did you say?]

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.800
[The signal's really bad here.]

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.800
I said I can't stay

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.800
in this house anymore.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.920
[What?]

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.120
[Who has dementia?]

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.400
Your signal is terrible.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.280
Fine, fine.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.160
Forget it.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.440
Yeah, right.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.760
If you like it, come again next time.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.840
[Ms. Zhou?]

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.560
Liu.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.560
Ms. Zhou,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.600
take a look.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.680
What would you like to buy today?

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.040
It's just me at home. I'm not cooking.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.120
I'll just grab something

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.960
to eat.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.840
What is she doing over there?

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.720
Over there?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.440
Livestreaming, selling tofu.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.159
Look at this tofu.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.440
Selling tofu on a livestream?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.159
So noisy. I gotta go.

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:00.000
Every soybean is plump and glossy.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.600
If you like it, place your order now.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.440
Thank you to my top donor.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.320
Love you.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.200
You're blocking the street.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.840
Heart to you. Thanks.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.680
Kevin just placed an order too.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.800
Thank you so much.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.080
Hello, welcome.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.919
How many in your party?

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:35.520
Just one.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.200
[I'm singing a song especially for you.]

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.400
Okay,

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.280
I'll definitely be there tonight.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.880
[Let me share some honest]

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.920
[thoughts with you.]

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.120
[Marriage isn't a necessity for women.]

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.680
This is my daughter.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.720
She's an influencer,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.640
a big deal.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.640
I'm watching her streams.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.120
How impressive.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.520
[Guys,]

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.800
[did you hear the nonsense]

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.920
[this streamer is spouting?]

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.800
[Her name is Zhang Ran,]

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.720
[and what she's saying]

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.480
[is way too extreme.]

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.160
[She says women don't need marriage.]

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.640
[Isn't that too narrow a view?]

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.560
Ran, watch what you say.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.280
If your mom sees this,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.400
there'll be trouble again.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.160
Wait a second.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.040
Sorry.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.480
You scared me!

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.000
What are you doing sitting here?

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.880
What, only you can sit here? I can't?

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.720
No, I mean...

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.880
This spot's yours only?

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.240
What are you watching there anyway?

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.560
None of your business.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.400
Listen, you can't

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.640
keep watching livestreams.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.160
You're on livestreams

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.640
every day yourself.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.120
It'll mess with your head.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.440
Yeah, you're the one with problems.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:18:59.640
Why did you

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.720
bring back that bag?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.600
Well, I...

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.800
Where else am I supposed to go?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.720
You think you can move back in? Get out!

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.320
No, wait.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.840
Go do whatever you want. Just leave.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:07.600
Go.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.240
Aiying, Aiying.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:08.800
Don't come back.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.760
I-I need to talk to you. It's important.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.480
No, you don't.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.040
We've lived together for decades.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.840
When have you

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.680
ever had anything important?

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.600
Go. Stop talking. Just go.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.840
I'm serious.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.320
I rushed back to tell you this.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.040
I don't want to hear it.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.680
Don't close the door.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.880
Listen to me,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.240
I really have something urgent.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:26.960
Look,

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.480
I was watching a livestream.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.120
I saw Ran...

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.840
Aren't you always watching livestreams?

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.440
I watched Ran's stream.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.040
Something's

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.840
off with her.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.720
The things she said were extreme.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.120
She even got into conflicts with others.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.240
So what?

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.080
Hasn't she always been like that?

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.360
She's been impulsive

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.760
since she was a kid.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.400
Don't get worked up.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.880
She tore up her marriage certificate.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.640
That's probably fake.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.040
She...

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.840
She got married without telling us

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.880
and just went to Canada.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.520
Right?

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.520
She divorced without

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.280
telling us either.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.880
Then she got married again.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.440
What can we do?

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.360
We can't control her anyway.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.480
Just respect her choices

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.560
and wish her well.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.160
Let's just live our own lives.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.440
Wait...

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.760
Stop overreacting.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.360
You're her mother. How can you not care?

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.360
And you're her father.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.000
Why don't you go talk to her?

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.760
No, Yudong...

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.760
I don't care about this or that.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.640
I'm done.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Aiying, Aiying.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:18.640
Wait.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.200
Aiying,

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.000
this...

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.920
Things're really wrong.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.400
Aiying.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:02.920
Aiying.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.920
the dumplings won't

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.240
taste good if they get cold.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.440
Come out

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.760
and eat.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.080
Who is it?

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.280
[Delivery.]

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.760
Delivery? We didn't order anything.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.200
[Yes, we did.]

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.680
Who...

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.080
[Coming.]

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.920
[You ordered delivery?]

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:45.920
Yeah.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.600
Coming.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.680
[Hi, here's your order.]

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.200
Please check.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:53.960
Okay, okay.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.840
Yeah, no problem.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.120
[Alright.]

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:57.760
[Thank you.]

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.400
[My pleasure.]

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.240
[I'm]

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.840
[standing up for you.]

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.800
[Women are...]

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.320
Have some dumplings.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.880
The filling's really good.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.720
The roast goose you bought looks tasty.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:50.840
What are you doing?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.520
From now on we eat separately.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.160
Come on, you can't finish half a goose

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.360
by yourself.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.280
I'll have the rest for dinner.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.440
I'm busting my ass here

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.640
while you're spacing out.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.640
Whose stall is this anyway?

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.320
You already know the process.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.360
Just handle it yourself.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.640
Wait, are you

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.240
still thinking about

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.320
your wife?

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.600
I already told you

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.480
she probably has a crush online.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.040
Get lost.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.960
That's the truth.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.200
My wife's in the

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.400
same state.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.520
Does nothing all day,

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.840
glued to her phone,

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.200
and giggling like an idiot.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.120
Who's your wife watching on livestream?

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.200
Is it a guy?

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.840
Yeah.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.240
But do you know how much

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.120
younger he is than her?

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.480
More than ten years.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.280
[Dude,]

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.680
are you gonna do business or not?

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.480
Coming, coming.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.040
Stop fooling yourself.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.280
Dating older women is trending now.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.080
Age doesn't matter.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.480
You better watch out. Coming.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:31.640
[Here, here.]

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.120
[Okay.]

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.280
[There you go.]

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.000
Shi!

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.440
Shi!

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.880
Wait.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.440
Li, watch my stall!

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.040
[I finally won, and now you're leaving?]

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.320
Just keep an eye on it for me.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.240
[Shi,]

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.360
[you still running this stall or not?]

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.320
Man,

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.440
look at her, all dressed up.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.480
That's a dangerous sign.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.960
She's even taking a taxi?

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.200
Oh no.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.440
Splashing out like that.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.960
She's definitely meeting a lover.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.440
Go after her.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.240
Go after what?

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.600
Your wife.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.080
Come on, move.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.400
I do this all the time.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.200
Come with me.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.120
Take these.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.840
Don't worry.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.640
We'll catch up.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.080
Let's go.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:43.960
Okay.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:49.440
Good.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.560
This...

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.720
Where'd she go? Lost her?

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.600
How can my

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.000
tricycle outrun a car?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.280
Even my dentures fell out.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.280
Look.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.200
Look at this car.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.080
This is it.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.840
I memorized the plate number.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:24.640
87?

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.640
Yeah, right.

Great, isn't it?

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.760
That's settled.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.200
Come sign here.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.160
How can you two cause

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.080
so much trouble?

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.080
At your age,

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.040
still getting into fights?

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.320
Who could you possibly beat?

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.440
He's a scammer! Tens of thousands!

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.680
It's my money.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.280
Does that even matter?

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.520
Who told you to sign?

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.840
If I didn't sign, could you get out?

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.200
You want to stay in there?

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:36.640
I...

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.640
Besides, if you'd

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.560
supported her more

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.400
and let her dance,

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.680
how could this have happened?

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.240
How could she be fooled?

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.240
And you're so extreme too.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.200
The top donator?

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.440
That competitive?

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.400
If he really got locked up today,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.480
what would you do then?

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.080
I can't believe you two.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.520
I'm swamped every day.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.120
This ends today.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.040
When we get home,

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.080
no one mentions it again.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.800
It's over. Try to understand each other,

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.160
okay?

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.160
Let's go.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.800
You're both this old,

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.560
and I'm picking you up from the police station.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.920
Isn't that embarrassing?

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:12.199
How ridiculous.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.480
Aiying,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.800
get up and eat lunch,

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:30.400
or the noodles'll be mushy.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.880
I've reheated them once already.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.760
Get up and eat something.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.400
Don't punish yourself.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.760
His streaming account got banned.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.920
Inducing tips and false advertising

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.080
was his fault.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.719
We got scammed,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.040
but let's just learn from it.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.159
As they say,

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.760
to err is human.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.320
Learning from mistakes is what...

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.040
What lesson am I supposed to learn?

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.800
We got scammed

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.080
out of...

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.120
Am I as cheap as you?

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.760
You think I care about the money?

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:01.840
I'm telling you,

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.200
I've put this behind me.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.480
I know he's a scammer.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.640
Stop bringing him up.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.720
What I'm thinking about

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.160
is that I've wasted

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.400
the first half of my life

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.280
and what I want

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.000
for the next few decades.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.240
Aiying, Aiying.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.040
What kind of life do you want?

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.600
Listen up,

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.360
starting tomorrow,

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.160
I, Zhou Aiying,

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.520
will be true to myself

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.840
and live for myself.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.920
Wait, Aiying, Aiying.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.640
If you live for yourself,

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.080
what about...

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.600
Stop bothering me.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.040
I just don't want to live with regrets!

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.400
Regrets?

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.640
Who doesn't have regrets?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.480
Bravo.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.840
Great.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.600
Slow, slow.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.560
[Quick, quick.]

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:38.680
[Slow.]

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.520
[Quick, quick, slow.]

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.600
Slow, quick, quick, slow.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.680
Quick, quick, slow, slow.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.320
Slow.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.560
Alright, class.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.720
Ten-minute break.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.720
[Mr. Liu, could you]

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.920
[help me with this move?]

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:00.880
Aiying!

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.160
Shi, what are you doing?

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.720
Aiying.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.640
What is it?

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.080
Jianbin collapsed outside.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:11.880
Where?

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:13.800
Look,

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.680
is that your husband?

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.520
Are you messing with me?

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.040
This is life or death.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.200
No time for jokes!

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.040
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:24.800
Why come here?

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.920
Go take a look first.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.760
Hurry up.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.520
Wait,

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.640
my bag's still there.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.680
[Sir, what are you doing?]

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.480
We know each other.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.520
Come on, let's go.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.600
Hurry up.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.560
Here.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:42.880
Quick.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.800
Is this a prank?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.400
You'll see when we get there.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.560
Get where?

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.040
Here.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.320
Look.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.160
Where?

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.600
Just wait a bit.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.440
Hold on.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.120
[He was just here.]

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.040
You tricked me, didn't you?

00:38:59.240 --> 00:38:59.880
I will deal

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.840
with you later.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.120
Zhang Jianbin!

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.120
I'm here.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.880
[Aiying, you came.]

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.920
Is this some kind of trick?

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.320
No, no.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.760
You planned this together,

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.320
didn't you?

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.080
No.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080
You think I'm easy to fool?

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.200
No, no, I...

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.200
You jerks.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.280
Aiying, Aiying, don't go.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:18.880
Don't go.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.760
Please, let me explain.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.480
I...

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.800
I tricked you here

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.840
because I wanted to apologize.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.680
I was wrong.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.280
I've failed you, Aiying.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440
Wrong about what?

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:30.720
I...

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.320
I haven't contributed

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.040
enough to our family

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.520
and I haven't cared enough.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.960
I'm really sorry.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.920
Stop with the empty words.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.560
I shouldn't have played

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.560
dumb in front of you.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.160
I always ignored

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.280
household matters.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.160
I was always avoiding you.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.040
You manage our home

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:54.920
and raised

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.400
Ran so well.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.960
You took such good care of me.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.120
I feel guilty.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.520
I've let you down.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.200
Even this scam

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.200
happened

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.080
because

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.680
I'd hurt you earlier.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.800
So when did it all go wrong?

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.360
From the

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.640
very first day

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.520
we met.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.400
Shi, let's start.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.160
Start what?

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.320
Aiying!

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.720
Aiying!

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.960
Isn't this Yonghong?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.600
Wu Ting.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.840
You're all here!

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.880
Careful there.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.120
I invited all your performance

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.920
troupe friends here.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.560
The dance performance in1983.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.840
That's when Aiying and I first met.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.200
I took her

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.360
picture that day.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.240
You've got some nerve bringing that up.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.400
The photo he took was blurry.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.200
Yes, yes,

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.760
I admit it.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.160
My photography skills were terrible

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.960
back then.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.360
So I tricked her here

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.640
to make up for that regret.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.400
And I asked you

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.160
to be witnesses.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.280
I will be a new man!

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800
You heard him?

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.400
Let's take photos.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.520
I don't have my costume.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.640
Shi, the costume!

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.440
Aiying's.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.640
Right away.
