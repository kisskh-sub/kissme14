WEBVTT

00:20.645 --> 00:21.730
Hey, catch her!

00:49.674 --> 00:51.843
MUNDANE

01:04.314 --> 01:05.315
There are

01:06.066 --> 01:08.026
no security cameras here, are there?

02:26.020 --> 02:26.855
Run!

02:49.210 --> 02:50.211
Jo Anna?

02:59.220 --> 03:03.349
Your kind always thinks
having superpowers solves everything.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.689
As if you ever did anything productive
or paid taxes with them.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.859
Where are your friends?

03:14.277 --> 03:17.405
Why do you make me do
the same thing over and over?

03:25.788 --> 03:27.332
I'll roast you to a crisp.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.009
Didn't you check the weather?

03:54.859 --> 03:56.027
It's raining.

03:59.739 --> 04:03.868
Do you know what's stronger
than a superpower in modern society?

04:07.372 --> 04:08.748
It's power.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.168
She's right.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.129
Having "super" in front
doesn't imply greater power.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.803
If anything, it's more like

04:23.763 --> 04:27.141
the relationship between gochujang
and chogochujang.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.270
Or perhaps a fly

04:31.229 --> 04:32.230
and a fruit fly.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.817
What I'm trying to say is

04:36.985 --> 04:38.319
that I'm screwed.

04:44.033 --> 04:47.036
MISSING PERSON

04:47.120 --> 04:52.125
LEE HWA-JIN, AGE 23
LAST SEEN AT JONGNO NAKSIN STATION

05:08.808 --> 05:11.436
Has it been a week
since we last heard from Hwa-jin?

05:11.936 --> 05:12.770
Yes.

05:19.944 --> 05:24.115
Bun-mi, you should learn
to control the anger within you.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.034
I'm working on it.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.368
Thought you were on a diet.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.120
I eat one meal a day.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.164
I can eat whatever I want
for that one meal.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.915
You had dinner with me earlier.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.459
This is dessert.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.295
And you drink alcohol every day too.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.341
-Wow, what's that?
-This.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.759
-It's crazy!
-Did you see it?

05:42.842 --> 05:45.011
Hey, everyone. Do you see that?

05:45.094 --> 05:47.722
-He's completely reckless.
-He's pulling the bus up.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.224
He's like Superman. I mean, Spider-Man!

05:50.308 --> 05:52.769
-Hey.
-Oh, it's zoomed in.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.854
Wow, he's pulled it up!

05:54.937 --> 05:56.773
-Amazing!
-He ended up getting arrested.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.568
We're watching the birth of a hero!

06:00.651 --> 06:03.654
The things falling from him
are coins, aren't they?

06:04.322 --> 06:07.325
-Yes.
-Everyone, this is 100% real.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.327
We have something like that
among our kind?

06:09.410 --> 06:10.495
Back in the day.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.251
Let's go get him.

06:18.002 --> 06:18.836
Drive…

06:19.921 --> 06:21.255
-You drive.
-What?

06:21.339 --> 06:24.384
No, I can't.
I need to start my shift. Later.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.136
A lot of people are probably after him.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.513
We must find him first.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.514
Hold on!

06:30.473 --> 06:32.558
Just wait a moment.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.104
We'll end up getting caught.
You said a lot of people are after him.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.648
If we run into them
while Hwa-jin's not even with us…

06:39.148 --> 06:41.401
The two of us are no match for them.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.610
Bun-mi!

06:45.738 --> 06:47.073
This guy is different.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.326
He can end this fight.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.087
I'm fucked.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.548
It's not like I did something bad,

07:04.173 --> 07:05.591
but I'm in a holding cell.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.094
He's the guy from the bus, isn't he?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.389
He's that crazy guy. Is he a junkie?

07:24.026 --> 07:24.861
Hey, there.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.947
I heard you pushed the bus over.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.658
Me?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.952
That wasn't me. I didn't do that.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.329
Look at this punk.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.373
He's totally nuts.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.375
-Go ahead and push me too.
-My goodness.

07:39.959 --> 07:40.793
I'd rather not…

07:43.379 --> 07:46.090
-See? I knew it wouldn't be him.
-He's no big deal.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.926
He's nothing!

07:49.969 --> 07:51.596
Keep it down in there!

07:52.972 --> 07:54.432
I was keeping it down.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.728
I want to go home.

08:00.062 --> 08:03.483
I just wanna take a shower,
scroll on my phone, and get some sleep.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.528
I want to get to work safely tomorrow.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.697
I can't believe going to work
is my wish now.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.702
God. Please help me.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.080
If you ever get into trouble,
use this contact.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.671
What's that idiot doing now?
What's up with him?

08:26.172 --> 08:27.423
Unbelievable.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.509
CHAIRWOMAN PARK JEONG-JA

08:29.592 --> 08:35.556
JEONGJA LOANS

08:37.642 --> 08:38.476
Hello?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.144
Oh, right.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.521
Hello.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.105
My name is Kang Sang-ung.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.651
My father told me to call this number

08:46.734 --> 08:50.112
if I got into any kind of trouble.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.074
And your father's name was?

08:53.157 --> 08:56.702
Right, his name is Kang Dong-gi.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.165
Mr. Kang, Dong, Gi.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.833
GA TO KIM

09:04.752 --> 09:06.128
KANG DONG-GI

09:08.047 --> 09:09.340
LOAN AGREEMENT
KANG DONG-GI

09:13.678 --> 09:14.512
All right.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.974
Is your father well?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.227
HOLDING CELL

09:22.019 --> 09:23.062
Thank you.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.403
It actually worked.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.411
MY MIN-SUK (50)

09:40.037 --> 09:41.080
I'm dead meat.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.420
Officer, the hero from the bus crash
is here, isn't he?

09:49.880 --> 09:52.091
I'll explain everything again
in the briefing.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.968
-I'm sorry.
-Mr. Kang.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.678
Mr. Kang Sang-ung?

10:05.146 --> 10:05.980
Oh my.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.820
You've truly been through a lot.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.244
But who might you…

10:26.334 --> 10:29.295
JEONGJA LOANS

10:31.255 --> 10:32.340
Chairwoman Park.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.841
-Mr. Kang is here.
-Chairwoman?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.178
Hello.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.431
-You're out of money, aren't you?
-Pardon?

10:40.931 --> 10:43.851
Get in. I'll get you home.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.486
I probably shouldn't have called.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.370
I saw the news.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.666
You did something incredibly admirable.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.000
Even I'm proud of you.

11:09.251 --> 11:14.006
Anyway, how did you even think to call me
in the middle of all that chaos?

11:15.216 --> 11:16.050
First of all,

11:16.842 --> 11:18.344
thank you for helping me.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.889
You're also polite.

11:25.893 --> 11:26.852
But you're curious

11:27.603 --> 11:32.149
to know how I know your father,
aren't you?

11:32.733 --> 11:35.236
Honestly, I'm not curious.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.450
Dong-gi owes me some money.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.955
A stranger is talking about my dad
like she knows him well

11:46.038 --> 11:48.249
and mentioning his loan shark debt.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.419
It's somewhat surreal.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.672
With the legal maximum interest rate,

11:55.172 --> 11:57.383
the total comes to three billion won.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.094
The door…

12:25.244 --> 12:26.579
BEOMHA RANCH

12:39.633 --> 12:41.552
BEOMHA RANCH

12:55.441 --> 12:56.484
RESTRICTED AREA

13:27.556 --> 13:30.392
MAN LIFTS FALLING BUS,
PREVENTING CASUALTIES

13:31.519 --> 13:33.437
Dad's going to like it.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.254
Hello.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.173
How does it feel to be ordinary again?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.716
Like being reborn?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.927
You should be thanking me.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.141
Is she dead?

14:11.642 --> 14:12.726
No.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.896
Damn it. She's no fun.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.192
Everyone's making such a big deal
out of this.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.663
This is pretty.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.042
-What happens if I get a shot of this?
-Sorry?

14:38.377 --> 14:39.587
Take it.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.801
The clinical trials are still--

14:52.933 --> 14:54.768
Incompetent bitch.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.108
You said the bus guy was broke, right?

15:01.191 --> 15:02.151
Yes, that's right.

15:02.651 --> 15:03.944
Make him even more broke.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.280
Then he won't be able
to use his powers at all.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.948
Shall I cut him off financially?

15:08.032 --> 15:11.076
That's not fun.
It's basically a battle of type matchups.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.788
Cash is just paper, right? Let's burn it.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.916
Oh, that's right.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.670
It still needs clinical trials,
doesn't it?

15:27.509 --> 15:28.594
Hi.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.014
Can I ask you a favor?

15:54.119 --> 15:54.954
Damn it.

15:57.706 --> 15:58.666
Jeez.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.377
Gosh, my head.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.065
Excuse me?

16:26.151 --> 16:27.528
What exactly

16:28.529 --> 16:30.906
is going on here?

16:31.865 --> 16:34.284
I need to see for myself

16:34.785 --> 16:36.996
whether you've actually inherited it.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.000
Get started.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.919
I should've cooperated
with the authorities

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
and faced the law's judgment.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.605
One thought came to me while being beaten.

17:05.899 --> 17:10.154
What the hell was Dad thinking
when he told me to call this place?

17:16.368 --> 17:17.453
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.412
Get up.

17:18.495 --> 17:19.580
What's with this punk?

17:20.414 --> 17:21.874
-Did he pass out?
-Is he dead?

17:31.508 --> 17:33.385
What's this? What's going on?

17:33.469 --> 17:34.803
What's all this?

17:34.887 --> 17:35.888
What's happening?

17:38.599 --> 17:39.767
What's going on?

18:06.335 --> 18:07.920
I realized two things.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.633
One. It did hurt,
but not enough to kill me.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.306
It's all thanks to the money.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.893
Two. If I spend all of it,

18:23.936 --> 18:26.688
that's when I'll really die.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.122
Damn!

18:43.831 --> 18:44.665
Come on!

18:47.417 --> 18:48.752
-Shit!
-Jeez.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.138
Damn you!

19:20.200 --> 19:21.034
Gosh.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.538
You little…

19:25.914 --> 19:28.458
What are you looking at? What?

19:30.252 --> 19:31.628
Did you hit me? I swear…

19:41.889 --> 19:44.683
I'm struggling because I have no money.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.226
It's exhausting.

19:46.935 --> 19:51.231
Come to think of it, I've struggled
and been exhausted my whole life.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.863
Everyone out.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.423
So you did inherit it.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.926
How is Dong-gi doing?

20:20.594 --> 20:21.762
In Spain…

20:32.314 --> 20:33.523
He's traveling.

20:36.276 --> 20:39.029
He skipped out with my money
and is now traveling in Spain?

20:39.112 --> 20:40.739
With that sly bitch?

20:42.199 --> 20:44.326
If Dong-gi had married me
like he promised,

20:44.409 --> 20:47.913
he would have bought an island
in Spain by now.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.581
Anyway,

20:49.665 --> 20:53.710
including the cost of the test,
the total is 3.005 billion won.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.212
You pay it back.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.267
Even as we speak, interest is piling up.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.064
In addition to that damn superpower,

21:14.648 --> 21:18.652
the second thing I inherited
was three billion won in debt

21:18.735 --> 21:19.903
from a third-rate lender.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.784
I'm sorry,

21:26.910 --> 21:28.370
but I think I should go home.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.747
-To discuss this with my dad first--
-Discuss what?

21:31.665 --> 21:32.874
Then how about this?

21:33.834 --> 21:36.086
If you're sorry, marry my daughter.

21:37.004 --> 21:37.838
Pardon?

21:37.921 --> 21:40.173
If you do that,
I'll forget about the money.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.969
Things are unfolding
like a daytime soap opera.

21:44.052 --> 21:47.597
If you become my son-in-law,
you'll never be short of money again.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.350
My daughter is so pretty
because she takes after me.

21:51.518 --> 21:52.352
Wow.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.647
That must be nice.

22:00.736 --> 22:01.653
You have a girlfriend.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.992
Are you hesitating because of her?

22:07.617 --> 22:08.493
That's not good.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.705
Listen carefully.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.501
If you leave like this,

22:17.002 --> 22:19.338
you won't even last 24 hours out there.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.174
If those guys get you, you're done for.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.554
Who are those guys…

22:27.637 --> 22:28.764
Didn't Dong-gi tell you?

22:29.806 --> 22:32.392
He's just as irresponsible now
as he was back then.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.435
They're out there.

22:33.935 --> 22:37.105
Some serious lunatics
you can't handle with your paycheck.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.192
So be my son-in-law

22:41.318 --> 22:42.444
and come live with me.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.406
Wait, what is this…

23:03.882 --> 23:04.800
Third floor?

23:08.929 --> 23:11.056
I think it would be around ten meters.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.059
10,000 won for every two meters.

23:15.435 --> 23:16.269
So 50,000 won.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.616
Hey!

23:34.538 --> 23:36.081
-Gosh!
-Goodness!

23:36.164 --> 23:37.082
Don't push me!

23:37.165 --> 23:38.917
I didn't. I was helping you.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.210
Let him go.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.894
He'll be back once he runs out of money.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.005
Wow.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.144
Goddamn it.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.899
Seriously.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.985
-Why?
-What happened?

24:54.075 --> 24:55.368
Were you here all night?

25:00.790 --> 25:01.917
This is you, isn't it?

25:04.419 --> 25:06.254
UNBELIEVABLE
BREAKING DOWN THE BUS CRASH

25:06.338 --> 25:07.923
ALIEN?
SUPERHUMAN?

25:08.006 --> 25:10.842
UNBELIEVABLE POWER
EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES

25:10.926 --> 25:13.470
INSANE POWER, WHO IS HE?
A KOREAN-STYLE SUPERHERO?!

25:14.221 --> 25:15.472
You've become famous.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.349
This is…

25:18.475 --> 25:20.310
Let me explain. I can explain.

25:20.810 --> 25:21.978
Explain it, then.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.358
What do I tell her?
How much do I tell her?

25:27.108 --> 25:29.444
I blew my mom's money,
got arrested by the police,

25:29.945 --> 25:31.863
then got caught again by a loan shark,

25:32.364 --> 25:34.074
and ended up owing three billion won.

25:36.576 --> 25:37.536
How much did you use?

25:39.746 --> 25:40.705
What was that money?

25:41.206 --> 25:44.334
If I tell the truth, Min-suk will kill me.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.878
-I asked you what that money was!
-Mom.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.632
-She gave me her savings pool money.
-How much?

25:51.841 --> 25:53.218
-Well, Min-suk--
-Forget it.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.761
-I'll ask Mother myself.
-Wait.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.144
Thirty

26:04.771 --> 26:05.605
million won.

26:10.944 --> 26:14.281
I was walking out with the cash
when an accident happened in front of me.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.949
So I had no choice!

26:20.412 --> 26:21.496
Okay?

26:32.716 --> 26:35.677
So-jeong is getting married.
At Cheongdam Hotel.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.012
Really?

26:37.512 --> 26:40.390
She told me to come with you
and catch the bouquet.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.435
-Then we should go. Let's go.
-No.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.524
I'm not sure if I can.

26:52.652 --> 26:53.570
Then I'll catch it.

26:53.653 --> 26:56.656
-I'm good at catching--
-You idiot. You said you wouldn't use it!

26:59.284 --> 27:02.287
You said your superpowers are useless!

27:07.709 --> 27:08.543
Min-suk.

27:09.210 --> 27:12.380
Min-suk. Just hear me out.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.340
Min-suk, I…

27:13.840 --> 27:15.634
Min-suk! Just wait!

27:15.717 --> 27:16.593
MIN-SUK

27:19.971 --> 27:20.972
Min-suk.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.432
Min-suk!

27:23.558 --> 27:24.559
Hey, Min-suk.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.645
Please wait.

27:26.728 --> 27:27.729
Min-suk!

27:28.438 --> 27:29.439
No, seriously…

27:37.238 --> 27:38.698
She could've just heard me out.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.200
Please pick up.

27:41.117 --> 27:43.036
Come on. Please answer, Min-suk.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.428
Wait. That's…

28:00.512 --> 28:02.097
-Is this 911?
-That's my place.

28:06.142 --> 28:06.976
No.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.438
It caught fire, for real!

28:14.734 --> 28:18.780
If you leave like this,
you won't even last 24 hours out there.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.616
Tell them to hurry. Quick!

28:22.283 --> 28:24.411
If those guys get you, you're done for.

28:25.286 --> 28:28.873
Some serious lunatics
you can't handle with your paycheck.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.840
What do I do now?

29:26.139 --> 29:27.807
Who were those guys?

29:29.267 --> 29:31.394
Should I turn myself in
to the police again?

29:32.061 --> 29:34.022
But what crime did I even commit?

29:34.856 --> 29:36.274
What if I walk free?

29:37.275 --> 29:38.526
Should I go to the press?

29:39.152 --> 29:41.070
But what if they think I'm crazy?

29:43.656 --> 29:46.576
I wonder if Min-suk is okay.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.579
MY MIN-SUK (20)

29:53.500 --> 29:56.085
Please pick up. Come on.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.966
The person you called is unavailable--

30:52.809 --> 30:55.103
TO SANG-UNG

31:11.286 --> 31:12.579
You're okay, right?

31:13.079 --> 31:15.623
Min-suk, everything is okay, right?

31:16.666 --> 31:18.293
Why haven't I heard from you?

31:27.010 --> 31:28.887
He'll come looking for his girlfriend.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.014
Even if people die,

31:31.598 --> 31:33.308
bring Kang Sang-ung in alive.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.767
Yes, it should be fine.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.358
This one's gonna be fun.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.323
-What the hell?
-What?

31:49.449 --> 31:50.283
What was that?

31:57.415 --> 31:58.458
What the…

32:01.628 --> 32:02.629
No.

32:11.679 --> 32:12.680
This way!

32:31.741 --> 32:33.785
FIRE AT CHEONGDAM WEDDING HALL
CHECKING FOR CASUALTIES

32:33.868 --> 32:34.869
Fire just reported.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.121
A short while ago, at around 2:10 p.m.,

32:37.205 --> 32:39.749
a fire occurred at Cheongdam Hotel
in Gangnam, Seoul.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.542
The fire is not yet under control.

32:42.251 --> 32:44.379
So-jeong's getting married.
At Cheongdam Hotel.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.797
She told me to come with you.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.173
2 P.M., CHEONGDAM HOTEL

32:47.256 --> 32:49.258
The extent of the damage
at Cheongdam Hotel…

32:49.342 --> 32:50.176
What is this?

32:50.259 --> 32:51.302
…is still unclear.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.137
-According to eyewitnesses…
-Hang on.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.015
MY MIN-SUK

32:58.309 --> 32:59.852
Answer the phone. Please pick up.

33:05.775 --> 33:08.361
The person you called is unavailable.
Please leave--

33:09.404 --> 33:11.155
Fuck. What do I do?

33:13.032 --> 33:14.409
I don't have any money.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.036
Fuck.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.474
Sang-ung.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.562
I saw the news about the bus accident.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.106
TO SANG-UNG

33:50.069 --> 33:51.738
It was a blurry image,

33:52.238 --> 33:54.115
but I knew it was you right away.

34:00.788 --> 34:02.790
I'm not sure where the money came from,

34:03.291 --> 34:05.960
but it must've hurt a lot,
even after doing a good thing.

34:09.964 --> 34:10.798
I felt the same.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.301
It was always like that.

34:17.638 --> 34:20.475
I always wanted to do more
for you and your mom,

34:20.975 --> 34:22.477
but something always came up.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.438
Excuse me.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.649
I'm sorry, but this is incredibly urgent.
I'm so sorry.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.776
Close this account.

34:29.859 --> 34:30.860
I'm sorry.

34:32.111 --> 34:34.906
Things like that will keep happening
to you now too.

34:38.993 --> 34:42.580
I always worked,
thinking that you or your mom could be

34:42.663 --> 34:46.626
in the overturned car, the academy bus,
or the burning building

34:46.709 --> 34:48.920
I was rescuing people from.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.349
SANG! UNG!

35:01.432 --> 35:03.726
Honestly, this job is unbearable
unless you think that way.

35:06.729 --> 35:08.356
Even if it's hard or scary,

35:09.023 --> 35:10.191
do not run from it.

35:13.986 --> 35:17.281
The person you love is waiting for you.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.127
That said, here's one piece of advice.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.963
Never cash out your savings…

35:35.007 --> 35:36.008
or your housing fund.

36:09.667 --> 36:10.668
What the hell?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.212
Please help her!

36:13.296 --> 36:14.505
Min-suk!

36:14.589 --> 36:16.090
Oh no, Min-suk!

36:16.174 --> 36:18.551
What do we do?
Somebody please help her! Oh my God!

37:21.781 --> 37:22.698
I told you

37:24.283 --> 37:25.618
I'm good at catching things.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.091
Are you okay?

38:34.520 --> 38:35.521
It's okay.

38:35.604 --> 38:37.648
I thought I was gonna die.

38:40.234 --> 38:41.193
Hey, it's okay.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.572
You're okay. It's all good.

38:51.829 --> 38:52.872
Where did you…

38:54.874 --> 38:55.833
get the money?

38:57.543 --> 38:58.377
I closed it.

38:59.503 --> 39:00.379
My housing account.

39:03.841 --> 39:04.759
Are you insane?

39:11.057 --> 39:12.600
Please step back!

39:13.225 --> 39:14.352
Step back a little.

39:46.092 --> 39:46.926
This way!

39:47.927 --> 39:49.303
Head down. Move slowly.

39:50.596 --> 39:51.430
Yes, come out.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.474
-Keep your head down.
-Thank you.

39:53.974 --> 39:55.851
Yes, lower your head more.

39:55.935 --> 39:56.977
Thank you.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.503
Here.

40:29.343 --> 40:31.220
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

40:31.303 --> 40:35.516
WIFE, KIM MIN-SUK
HUSBAND, KANG SANG-UNG

40:37.393 --> 40:39.019
Apply for housing in your name.

40:41.063 --> 40:44.400
They say if we win
the newlywed housing lottery,

40:44.483 --> 40:46.152
we can keep it even after a divorce.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.994
If you're okay with it…

40:59.665 --> 41:01.459
let's get married.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.453
As obvious as it may seem,

42:19.954 --> 42:22.498
I wasn't the only one in this world

42:22.998 --> 42:25.084
who could use superpowers.

42:30.297 --> 42:31.131
What is that?

42:32.049 --> 42:33.884
Someone I can't handle with my paycheck.

42:35.970 --> 42:37.388
What do we do?

42:37.888 --> 42:39.682
Min-suk, step back for a bit.

42:40.766 --> 42:42.226
What? Why?

42:44.270 --> 42:45.854
I still have some money left.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.196
This is driving me crazy.

42:59.201 --> 43:00.160
Sang-ung, be careful.

43:19.597 --> 43:20.598
Sang-ung!

43:28.856 --> 43:30.608
My money. Damn it.

43:49.209 --> 43:50.252
Damn, it's hot!

43:52.880 --> 43:53.922
Sang-ung!

43:58.802 --> 43:59.970
Damn it.

44:49.228 --> 44:51.230
Kang Sang-ung!

45:01.198 --> 45:02.241
Damn it.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.710
I don't know what you're trying to pull,

45:13.836 --> 45:15.129
but leave him alone.

45:22.678 --> 45:23.762
Hey!

45:38.694 --> 45:39.528
Back off.

45:40.112 --> 45:42.197
Damn it. Don't come near me.

46:32.414 --> 46:36.210
You set dangerous fires

46:37.211 --> 46:38.462
and threw things at people.

46:39.546 --> 46:42.299
It's hot, you rude bastard!

46:44.343 --> 46:45.344
Damn bastard.

46:56.355 --> 46:58.315
Thank God you're alive.

47:05.948 --> 47:07.324
Are you okay?

47:11.495 --> 47:13.789
Sang-ung, where did you get that money?

47:15.749 --> 47:16.583
It's hot.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.001
What?

47:22.756 --> 47:23.882
Is it the wedding gift money?

47:29.805 --> 47:31.223
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WEDDING

47:31.807 --> 47:34.768
So it was So-jeong's wedding gift money.

47:36.478 --> 47:37.896
God, no.

47:39.273 --> 47:41.108
Sang-ung!

47:41.608 --> 47:44.278
Kang Sang-ung, stay with me, okay?

47:47.489 --> 47:49.283
You'll be okay. It's going to be okay.

48:24.443 --> 48:25.277
Sang-ung.

48:26.028 --> 48:26.862
Over there.

48:58.560 --> 48:59.394
Sang-ung.

49:01.980 --> 49:03.482
So you're Sang-ung.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.192
Is your father well?

49:10.322 --> 49:11.657
Who are these people?

49:12.616 --> 49:15.619
What the hell had Dad been doing
all this time?

49:28.590 --> 49:31.760
Back in the day, your dad used to buy me
a lot of drinks.

49:31.843 --> 49:33.595
Take slow breaths. Slowly.

49:36.431 --> 49:37.349
Bun-mi.

49:37.849 --> 49:41.061
That bastard is using Hwa-jin's powers,
isn't he?

49:41.144 --> 49:42.771
Yes, it seems like it.

49:43.355 --> 49:44.356
Wait a minute.

49:45.857 --> 49:46.817
Who…

49:46.900 --> 49:48.777
The Society of Korean Superhumans.

50:02.749 --> 50:03.917
I hate this.

50:04.418 --> 50:05.293
I'm screwed.

50:07.421 --> 50:10.382
I'm totally screwed today too.

53:16.193 --> 53:21.198
