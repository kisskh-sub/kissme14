=Episode 19=

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.760
(I always spot)

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.040
(the odd ones out too easily.)

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.560
(Every person has an evil obsession.)

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.640
(It may be tiny,)

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.400
(and it may hide deep.)

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.020
(I can become an anchor)

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.860
(for each dark urge.)

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.100
(Chemistry)

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.120
(I never expected)

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.520
(company on this road.)

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.910
(When I first met Lu Ran,)

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.000
(we only leaned on each other)

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.470
(because we were weak.)

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.800
(When I finally grew up)

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.560
(and tried to teach him how to be)

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.800
(an upright man,)

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.750
(he chose to leave.)

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.630
Not seeing me off?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.710
Let it be.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.630
(When He Ya also decided)

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.080
(to walk away from our marriage,)

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.000
(I realized)

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.360
(there is)

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.840
(no once-and-for-all way)

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.400
(to keep the right people.)

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.800
(Life is always unpredictable;)

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.690
(it offers no result.)

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.750
(So, I bought)

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.870
(Wu Min's old house)

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.000
(the crime scene)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.270
(that trapped me in obsession.)

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.430
(Only by touching
the unanswered questions)

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.510
(can I return to a normal life.)

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.000
(He suffers the same pain I do;)

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.600
(a pain that makes life
worse than death.)

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.480
(Perhaps what keeps pain at bay)

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.510
(isn't happiness,)

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.920
(but addiction.)

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.480
(And addiction usually ends)

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.390
(in death.)

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.040
I've made up my mind.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.800
When do we do it?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.870
I'll give you another vial
of my bio-data,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.000
in case you need it.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.520
My company's DNA bank

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.270
is linked nationwide.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.430
Once it's altered,
you'll be Zhuang Mingcheng.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.830
DNA is only data

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.750
in the end.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.560
If I can tamper with it,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.920
it's my parents

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.750
signaling me to join them.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.950
No one in this world cares about me.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.190
I'm just going to reunite

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.120
with them.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.000
Aren't you curious

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.830
what I'll do with your identity?

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.600
Not interested.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.870
I hate the name Zhuang Mingcheng.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.800
I doubt

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.720
your fate under that name

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.950
will be better than mine.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.710
Lu Ran,

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.230
do you know

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.750
that sometimes,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.800
one wrong step

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.000
is the point of no return.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.070
Is this you?

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.670
Yes.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.150
Do you like it?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.720
It's brilliant.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.040
Would you let us show it

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.600
at our art exhibition?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.560
It belongs in a museum.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.930
Of course, I'd be delighted.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.070
Nothing could be luckier.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.950
Is that you?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.080
Then who is this?

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.190
Someone far away from me.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.510
I know the man

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.450
beside Jiang Yongquan.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.800
I can help you.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.800
(When no one can make you happy,)

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.800
(you start wanting pain.)

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.560
(It's the only thing)

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.510
(that makes me feel alive.)

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.600
(I accept this fate,)

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.510
(even if,)

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.840
(like every bad habit,)

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.360
(it will destroy me.)

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.120
(Everyone still has)

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.270
(a chance to choose good.)

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.270
(The choice)

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.080
(has always been in their own hands.)

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.630
(But for what you've done wrong,)

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.720
(you must bear the consequence)

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.240
(and pay the price)

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.960
(to reach the path of good.)

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.440
(My existence is the result of evil.)

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.120
(Returning to Wuyang)

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.480
(means seeking the source of that evil.)

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.080
(Every single person)

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.270
(in this trafficking chain)

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.790
(must suffer the backlash
of their malice.)

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.440
(Real life is built)

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.270
(on rational moral norms.)

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.630
(Law is the bottom line of morality,)

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.440
(unforced by survival,)

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.200
(unswayed by desire.)

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.240
(I finally understand what home means.)

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.120
(Home is fate:)

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.840
(After countless choices,)

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.120
(you still walk the inevitable road.)

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.240
(Whether fortunate or not,)

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.320
(it is where you belong)

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.550
(like marrow in your bone.)

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.680
You're done?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.440
Yes.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.720
So comfortable.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.130
I wanted to let you know:

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.120
The child's treatment fee has arrived.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.600
- Yes.
- Thank you.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.480
Really, thank you.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.670
Thank you.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.510
Don't mention it.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.560
Uncle Jiao.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.480
From now on, if I ever need help

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.360
and come to you,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.960
please don't refuse.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.800
Don't worry.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.040
From this day on,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.200
I'll do

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.040
whatever you ask.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.720
You're too kind.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.750
But the hospital says

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.270
we still have to wait for an organ.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.510
How long will it be?

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.390
Usually

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.550
three to five years.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.320
Three to five years?

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.200
Money doesn't work?

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.510
This isn't a vegetable market.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.510
What has to match is a kidney.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.040
Besides,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200
we can't just grab

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.150
someone off the street

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.240
and cut out their kidney, right?

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.360
Right, of course.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.840
I'm just afraid

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.840
the child won't make it.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.440
Don't worry.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.390
Leave it with me.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.720
I'll see what else I can do.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.360
Great.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.240
Thank you.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.510
Time for work.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.390
I've got to go.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.510
Treat this place

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.270
as your own home.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.540
Make yourself comfortable.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.600
You're our benefactor.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.920
You go ahead.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.640
Yu, eat something before you leave.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.630
I've got to get

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.610
to the plant early today.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.840
Now that we have money,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.080
I'll tell the guys

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.030
to stop the collection.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.630
Go ahead.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.790
I'm off. Bye.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.720
Take care, Yu.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:07.870
What about his girl?

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.390
I'll bring it to the hospital later.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.320
Let's eat first.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.870
I never saw

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.840
a fish this big when I was little.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.170
This is nothing.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.070
My dad and my brother
caught even bigger ones.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.360
Xi,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.240
you've been away so long.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.870
Are you missing your family?

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.110
No.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.720
You eat; I'll get some rice.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.280
Yes, yes.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.510
That's him.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.720
The one who contacted me wasn't him.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.280
This guy said

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.100
a friend of his wanted to kill himself,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.600
and nothing could stop him,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.910
but he knew the location

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.840
and asked me to rush over to save him,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.450
saying he'd race back himself.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.060
(Lie Reef; Red buoy)

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.120
Who contacted you?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.240
I never saw him.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.960
He paid up front

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.440
and sounded desperate.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.240
It was a life hanging by a thread,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.790
so I didn't think twice.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.440
Did he call again?

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:06.630
With so many boats,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.480
he asked for an unlicensed one.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.070
Didn't you get suspicious?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.000
I did,

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.320
but saving a man came first.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.510
I...

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.600
Is this the number?

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.600
You found him?

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.610
Where did you drop him?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.840
On the shore.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.390
He said he'd come to his senses;

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.550
his friend also called,

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.690
saying everything was fine.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.150
He picked an empty stretch of bank

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.990
and got on.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.750
I can still remember roughly where.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.280
Yin.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.360
How is it?

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.200
Nothing here.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.510
Your side?

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.800
Keep going.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.590
Let's go.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.200
Lu Haitao of Lujia Village,

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.540
can someone
who once sheltered abductors

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.840
and ran prostitution

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.390
be the village secretary?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.150
Who are you?

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.000
Who on earth are you?

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.790
Don't talk nonsense.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.480
You did terrible things

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.120
and bribed the villagers.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.200
If you don't want anyone

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200
to find out about this,

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.840
do exactly as I say.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.510
What do you need?

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.000
What do you want?

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.870
Make a phone call.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.200
That's all?

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.790
Captain He Ya,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.280
CIU 1, Wuyang PSB.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.630
You've got her number, right?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:56.920
(Police)
Okay.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.390
Okay, thanks.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.480
The local station confirms it:

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.540
Zhuang Mingcheng did stay
in the fishing village

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.200
for several days.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.030
Yin Wei, come with me
to the village again.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.600
Xu Jingzhi, you stay.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.480
All this effort

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.030
just to earn a shred

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.550
of his approval.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.430
You don't understand.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.170
He'll never give it to you.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.640
Without trying,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.370
how do you know it won't work?

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.720
When will you give up?

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.720
No matter when,

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.550
I won't stop looking for him.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.270
I don't know

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.240
what give up means.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.200
Sir.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.040
Speak.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.560
The boat's ready.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.960
IDs are at the rendezvous.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.240
I've stashed a few extras

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.350
just in case.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.030
You can leave any time.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.560
Good.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:27.590
Sir,

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.640
take care.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.030
I've settled everything here.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.850
Once the ship hits international waters,

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.050
you'll be safe.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.760
Understood.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.240
Hello?

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.110
Who is this?

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.110
Hello,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.350
we're the police.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.200
What can I do for you?

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.240
Do you know this man?

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.480
He's our great benefactor.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.000
What's the matter?

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.400
Where is he now?

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.870
No idea.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.960
He went out after breakfast.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.110
Really.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.880
Why would I lie to you?

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.510
The doctor just called.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.790
It's a miracle.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.790
Check

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.370
if there's any source available.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:35.550
Get it arranged right away.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.510
Hurry up.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.110
Don't forget to say thank you.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.110
Okay, bye.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:46.420
(Consignor: Li Ming; Cargo: Organ)

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.100
(Wuxi Chemical Plant; Lujia Village)

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.720
Hello?

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.400
So, have you thought it over?

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:29.640
Your silence

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.790
tells me you're listening.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.310
Let me spell it out for you:

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:36.920
Inside your waste center,

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.640
you've got two tons of banned waste

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.680
in tanker trucks,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.680
ready to roll anytime.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.790
If I remember right,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.750
your shift starts

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.070
in an hour.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.550
You'll deliver them.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.640
No, listen...

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.480
Jiao Yu,

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.070
I brought your package here.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.270
What I prepared for you

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.110
has arrived.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.520
Don't be scared.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.880
You only need to drop it in.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.270
What are you trying to do?

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.480
What do you want?

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.590
Remember what you promised

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.650
your wife on her deathbed

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.200
that you'd take care of your daughter?

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.400
The money is a sign of my good faith.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.070
The kidney match is already here.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.350
Hello?

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.680
Are you going

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.720
to watch her die?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.840
Don't say that.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.350
My daughter won't die.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.880
She has to live.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.350
She must live.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.160
The plane lands in 15 minutes.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.000
The organ's on board.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:02.400
We can start the transplant anytime.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.510
If you don't want it,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.480
I'll let it rot,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.640
but don't forget

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.880
how hard it is to find

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.160
a compatible donor.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.270
They refused at first.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.350
I'm the one

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.160
who got it for you.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.480
I can't.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.960
I can't do this.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.000
Really.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.440
Something huge will happen.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.070
I beg you.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.910
Please let me go.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.440
I can do something else

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.350
for you.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.240
Anything.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.110
Whatever you need.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.080
Anything.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.070
My goal is simple.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:44.680
I don't care about the process.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.640
I can't.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.160
I can't do this.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.270
Put the igniter

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.590
into the waste center,

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.630
or

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.160
use your professional skill

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.400
to turn it

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.430
into an accident.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.390
Hello?

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.000
Yuan,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.480
you always know me best.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.030
You found this place at once.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.320
Lu Ran,

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.830
you're no fun.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.400
Did you see the gift I left you?

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.110
Yes.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.150
Oh, right.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.680
I forgot to mention:

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.750
You've got one last place to visit.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.160
What do you want?

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.590
If you don't show up,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.960
I'll detonate the explosives.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.440
I'll wait for you.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.950
Lu Ran?

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.000
Eat up.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.020
(Zhuang Mingcheng)

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.160
The plane's landing.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.590
Eat up.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.720
Take your time.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.790
The meal's not bad, huh?

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.510
You're incredibly lucky.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:12.860
Exactly.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.050
One word from your benefactor

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.220
made the money that was supposed
to take three months

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.860
arrive in less than a week.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.590
Organs are trickier, though.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.720
Why not ask

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.480
your benefactor for another favor?

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.350
What more can he ask?

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.170
I heard plenty of people wait

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.750
till they die and still don't get one.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:29.720
Stop talking nonsense.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.640
Sorry, sorry.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.640
I'm done.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.030
You guys carry on.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.110
I've got to go.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.830
Watch your mouth.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.160
Think before you speak.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:52.140
(Captain He)

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.040
Hello?

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.680
Is this Captain He Ya?

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.520
Who's calling?

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.270
Lu Haitao from Lujia Village.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.960
We met when you came

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.800
to the village.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.530
What can I do for you?

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.790
I'm reporting a crime.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.590
Someone just called,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.890
saying a bomb's been planted

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:12.750
in Lujia Village.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.920
When I tried to call back,

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.240
the phone was already off.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.590
Did he say

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.430
where the bomb is?

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.000
No.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.880
He only said that one line and hung up.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.000
I have no idea

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.310
if it's real or a hoax.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.030
Has anyone suspicious come

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.030
to your village lately?

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.100
Off the top of my head,

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.370
I can't think of anyone.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.310
How about this, Captain He?

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.310
I'll walk around the village

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.490
and take another look.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.030
All right. Stay safe.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.070
We'll get there asap.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.240
Please send me the number

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.350
that just called you.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.380
(Recipient: Captain He)

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.080
Come in.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:57.900
Director Feng.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.550
More bomb threats
from Wuyang University,

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.490
Xinyuan Trade Center,

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.600
the river-crossing bridge,
and the fishing village.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.160
That makes four locations so far.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.310
All the places

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.400
Zhuang Mingcheng has been.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.050
Nearest specialists are already on-site

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:08.890
for searches.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.070
The unfinished building blew up.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.160
Comrade Liu Ming died.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.000
We cannot allow

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.590
people's lives or property

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.920
to be threatened again.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.110
Notify every department:

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.240
Search meticulously.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.350
Control every risk.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.190
Yes.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.790
Director Feng,

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.110
Lujia Village may have a bomb.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.070
I'm heading there now.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.550
Fire crews have been told.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.270
Check if it's real

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.680
and whether it's a trap
set by Zhuang Mingcheng.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.520
Sure.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.550
Shiqi, I just sent you

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:44.400
a phone number.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.240
Trace

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.200
its location.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.520
Get out at the next junction;

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.620
Li Long will ride with me.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.950
You take your team to the plant.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.230
Find Jiao Yu no matter what.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:54.850
As expected, he didn't plan

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:55.980
to spare Lujia Village.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.510
Be extremely careful.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:35.480
Finally off work.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.180
(Explosive)

(Flammable liquid; Explosive)

00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.010
Captain He.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.520
(Lujia Village)
You're here at last.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.490
Anything so far?

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.550
I walked the whole village

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:04.750
and found a big truck

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.130
that doesn't belong to anyone here.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:07.750
Let's go have a look.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:08.940
- Sure.
- Let's go.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.740
(Big-Data Intelligence Center)

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.470
Jiao Yu!

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.100
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.120
I...

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.840
My daughter is so little.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.800
She can't die.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.280
I finally found a matching kidney.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.110
I have to save her.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.630
I have to save my girl.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.070
I can't see the people clearly now.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.920
We're getting higher and higher.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:01.920
Surely, everything's a blur.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.960
Watch the direction they walk,

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.150
and you'll know

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.440
where they're headed.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.150
I envy the place they're going.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:15.880
No one feels hated there.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.670
You think your mother

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.230
hates you,

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.120
right?

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.960
Not completely.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.600
Yuan,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:34.710
you treat me

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.030
differently from them.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.920
In her eyes, I shouldn't exist at all.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.190
Give her time.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.190
She loves you.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.230
But if she pushes you away

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.320
and even insults you,

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.710
how do we fit in

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:54.960
and still respect her?

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:56.480
She can't give me

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.320
the home you once described.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.800
You're smart.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.070
You'll realize

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.760
goodness is human nature.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.480
Until then,

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:09.920
hold on to hope.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.510
The stuff is off the clock.

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:07.920
Why are you still inside?

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.670
Did they forget you?
