♪Your love's a mirror, I see me true♪

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.300
♪Two-way love, I'm complete with you♪

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.060
♪Two hearts beating,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.040
I nodded off.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:10.900
Let's go.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.340
Was I asleep for long?

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.460
Fifty minutes.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.440
Why were you timing it?

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.540
So, how'd it end?

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.080
Did

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.900
the heroine get rescued?

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.740
Who took her?

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.640
The hero's father.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.840
No way. Why?

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.960
He was running

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.060
illegal drug trials,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.440
and she stumbled upon it.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.200
Then...

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.720
Wow, your boyfriend's a pro

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.680
at multitasking.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.660
He nailed

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.440
every detail.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.160
She said you were multitasking.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.040
You didn't doze off either, did you?

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.120
It's almost 1 AM.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.700
Let's skip the city view tonight

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.680
and just get some rest.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.900
We've got a wedding to catch tomorrow.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.360
Fine.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.020
If you're beat,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:18.920
just head back.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.620
So Shengyi was just talking big.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.640
He said you could pull an all-nighter
in surgery

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.500
and still be raring to go.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.100
Follow me.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.900
Thanks.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.000
No problem.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.980
Actions speak louder than words.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.180
Lin Yusen,

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.080
how old are you?

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.280
Nie Xiguang,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.920
you clearly don't know enough

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.880
about your boss.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.800
Do you work for me,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.900
or am I reporting to you actually?

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.840
You flip between roles way too easily.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.860
I like this position.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.280
I get to boss you around

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.040
while I'm still on your payroll.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.980
That's more like slavery.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:08.940
Come on, spill.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:09.780
How old are you?

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.380
Twenty-eight.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.880
Twenty-eight.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.880
Twenty...

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.180
That's impossible.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.840
You

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.260
have a PhD, right?

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.540
You finished a doctorate

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.300
and practiced medicine.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.280
The math just doesn't add up.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.960
I mean, you look young, obviously.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.720
Well, thank you.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.800
I started school early.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:41.740
So

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.780
I got my degree a bit ahead of schedule.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.000
Then

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.380
why did Shengyi call you

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.080
the legendary machine
of your med school?

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.320
Nie Xiguang,

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.060
do you seriously think it's okay

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.540
to ask me that right to my face?

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.580
Maybe you should

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.960
ask Shengyi yourself,

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.120
now that

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.980
you've exchanged numbers.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.460
Just how much did he trash-talk me?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.640
It's like he spilled

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.200
all my dirty laundry to you.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.580
Relax.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.020
He didn't mention

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.880
your dating history

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.700
or any of that gossip.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.720
What dating history?

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.740
Med school was a grind,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.000
and so was being a surgeon.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.560
I didn't exactly have a window

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.080
for dating.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.300
What about your admirers?

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.820
With your looks and pedigree,

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.940
there must have been a line
out the door.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.720
Maybe I just has

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.940
impossibly high standards.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.680
Since when

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.260

Hi, I'd like to check in, please.

May I see your ID, please?

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.260
Hey, Lin Yusen.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.880
Where are you? Don't leave yet.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.300
Hi.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:23.900
I forgot my ID card.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.520
But I have this temporary ID

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.819
from the police station nearby.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.400
Alright. I'll get that sorted for you.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.220
Great, thank you.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.360
You're dying to laugh, aren't you?

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.480
Is it that obvious?

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.240
I knew it.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.100
I didn't expect

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.500
the day to end with a plot twist.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.160
But hey,

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.500
now we're

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.000
even "closer"

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.940
considering we've visited
the police station together.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.980
Keep it down, would you?

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:55.920
Sorry for the wait, ma'am.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.580
Here are your key card
and breakfast vouchers.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.320
Breakfast tomorrow

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.120
is served until 10:30 AM.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.400
It's in the Chinese restaurant
on this floor.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.440
Okay.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.440
Thanks.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.580
Remember to deadbolt the door
once you're inside

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.180
and don't open it for anyone.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.340
If anything seems off,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.220
call me immediately.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.980
Don't be so paranoid.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.080
How can I not be?

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.380
We literally just came back

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.460
from the police station.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.440
So,

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.240
for the sake of my reputation
and my innocence,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.360
stay safe in there,

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.240
okay?

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.820
Okay.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.080
You're not gonna

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.260
rub it in for a whole year, are you?

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.140
I doubt it.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.600
Given your "talent" for drama,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.680
you'll probably have a new story

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.840

That's okay.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.200
Just get out here.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:40.640
Alright then.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:49.920
Gotta go.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.300
Xigua!

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.700
Boss.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.260
What's this supposed to mean?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.660
You trying to outshine me
on my wedding day?

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.960
And what was your boyfriend driving?

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.120
It looked insane.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.880
Boss, it's your wedding.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.160
Chill out.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.880
It's your big day.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.080
I had to pull out all the stops.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:07.780
Thanks.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.180
Thanks.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:09.940
I've got this.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.320
Blame Xiang Qun for this.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.720
He said

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.380
back around graduation,

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.680
when they were drinking in the dorm,

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.180
Zhuang Xu got wasted and said

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.420
he had no idea

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.240
how many years he'd have to grind

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.060
just to afford a wedding.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.860
He was sure he'd be the last
to get married.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.460
So he promised he'd be there
as the groomsman.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.240
As for my side of things,

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.020
Rong's been so hands-on this time.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.360
Xigua.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.120
Go easy on her.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.320
Congrats.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.320
Thanks.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.780
Wait, you brought a gift too?

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.040
I said

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.020
you should just enjoy the feast.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:49.900
We basically sent them double.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.640
No.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.700
Shouldn't the gift come from me?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.920
But that is way too generous.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.100
Where's my knife?

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.040
I need something

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.440
to cut through
all this mushy lovey-dovey stuff.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:06.940
His gift

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.980
has nothing to do with me.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.800
This one is from me.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.000
Boss,

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.680
be happy, okay?

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.700
Xigua.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.780
Hold on tight

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.980
to your happiness.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.460
Don't be silly.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:33.760
I will.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.000
Xigua!

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.840
Xiguang, hurry up.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.420
Hello.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.500
You sit next to her.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.660
I feel like she's about

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.440
to put me under interrogation.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.480
I can

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.920
grill your boyfriend too, you know?

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.660
Well, let's see what you've got.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.460
Just make something up.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.900
But don't go overboard.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.760
I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.780
What's the angle here?

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.060
Like...

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.240
Was it you chasing me,

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.580
or the other way around?

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:24.800
How long has it been?

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.920
We should sync up on the basics.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.700
Do we really need to get that specific?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.060
What are you

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.600
whispering about?

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.620
You guys see each other every day,

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.100
and you still have to murmur

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.040
to each other in front of us?

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.260
We are not.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.300
Food's here.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.640
Sweet.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.840
At least we won't have to watch this

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.500
on an empty stomach.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.740
Boss surely knows the drill.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.720
Is no one sitting next to me?

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.640
The food is already being served.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.580
These seats

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.020
are for the bridesmaid and groomsman.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.140
There's no room at the head table.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.380
I doubt they'll even have time

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.140
to grab a bite anyway.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.760
So it's just the eight of us then.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.520
More food for us.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.199
Typical. Always about the food.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:24.639
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.659
The ceremony is about to begin.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.380
Please join me
in a warm round of applause

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.820
to welcome

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:30.719
the newlyweds.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.380
College romance is simple yet timeless.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.900
Our bride and groom

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.420
both attended the prestigious

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:44.460
Jiangning University.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:45.780
They met

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.480
through mutual friends

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:48.400
and shared

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.219
a beautiful journey together.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.239
Now, six months after graduation,

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.340
the deep bond they share

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.080
has led them to make

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.800
a lifelong vow to one another,

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.100
and step into

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.420
this next great chapter

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.360
of their lives

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.380
together.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.280
Let's hear it

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.140
for their unwavering love.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.120
They must be

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.220
overwhelmed with joy,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.340
but there are

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.600
four people

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.600
even more moved,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.500
their

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.260
parents.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.660
And to our proud parents,

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.260
would you please stand

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.760
and say hello

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.520
to everyone?

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.340
Xiguang,

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.360
relax.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.380
Where did you even

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.260
find this giant hunk of fat?

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.740
So focused?

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:12.700
Just grabbed whatever.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.220
Gee, thanks.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.220
I'll help myself.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:22.840
Rong.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.580
Shouldn't you be with the bride?

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.720
Boss told me to take a break

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.400
and get some food.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.340
Her relatives are taking over for now.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.460
You'd better dig in,

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.640
or there'll be nothing left.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.560
I thought you were on a diet.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:34.860
Piling it high, are you?

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.260
Wedding calories don't count.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.880
Your name sounded so familiar

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.860
when I heard it yesterday.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.100
And then you mentioned
you're from Shengyuan.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.340
It only just clicked

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.980
that you're

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.040
our chairman's

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.000
grandson.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.460
You work at Shengyuan?

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.120
I'm the assistant
to Mr. Sheng in Marketing.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.480
Xingjie?

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.320
So you're working under him.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.560
Xigua,

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.300
is your boyfriend's family
actually that powerful?

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.000
Too bad I never

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.080
ran into you at HQ.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.700
I'd only just joined the company

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.960
when I heard you

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:19.720
were assigned

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.580
to a subsidiary.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.180
So you ended up in Suzhou.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.620
And in the same company as you, Xiguang.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.060
By the way, Xiguang,

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:26.360
why did you decide

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.400
to work in Suzhou?

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.320
I mean, Suzhou is doing great,

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.880
but it still doesn't compare

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.280
to Shanghai for opportunities.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.380
Actually, I quite like Suzhou.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.560
The office there

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.200
is a joint venture
between my family and Shengyuan.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.780
It's just more laid-back.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.840
Sure, Shanghai has
plenty of opportunities,

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.920
but the ones you mention

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.760
aren't really useful to me.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:57.520
Oh right,

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.140
my family knows the Shengs quite well.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.580
Rong, since you're working at Shengyuan,

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.560
if you run into any problems,

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.300
you can always come to me.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.260
Don't be shy about it.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.520
The bond we shared in college

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.260
is truly rare and valuable.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.660
If there's any way I can help,

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.540
I definitely will.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:24.900
Come on, dig in.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.320
They're coming over to toast us.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.040
Xiang Qun looks pretty sharp today.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Was I being too cocky?

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.480
What are you laughing at?

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.560
It's funny

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.720
watching someone

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.180
putting on a big show,

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.260
while the real heavy hitter next to me

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.960
only throws out a soft nudge,

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.460
just enough

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.900
to keep people in line.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.400
The food here is pretty good.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.840
Really worth the price.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.860
They even serve lobster.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.500
Xiguang,

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.160
did you come over

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.440
from Suzhou this morning?

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:05.940
No.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.340
It got

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.300
too late last night,
so I didn't go back.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.260
Wait, did I hear that right?

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.440
You didn't go back to Suzhou last night?

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.100
Don't tell me you stayed in Shanghai.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.380
So where did you stay?

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.560
Mr. Lin must have a house

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:30.980
in Shanghai.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:33.980
My place

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.360
is close to Xiguang's hotel,

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.480
so I can swing by and pick her up.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.520
I see.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.340
Hey, you came over too?

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.340
Shouldn't you be with Boss,

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.540
doing the rounds?

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.220
Well,

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.840
their relatives
can really hold their liquor.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.780
Guess they don't need
Zhuang Xu for that.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.280
Besides,

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.200
he doesn't seem like

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.480
much of a drinker

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.940
anyway.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.520
He can drink way more now

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.240
than back in college.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.280
Finance sure makes you better
at holding your liquor.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.060
Oh right,

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.760
he told me yesterday

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.700
that he actually switched
from Huaya's Loans

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.640
to Investment Banking.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.520
Seriously?

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.880
Even Huaya's regular departments

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.680
are tough to get into,

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.140
let alone Investment Banking.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.200
Zhuang Xu, that's incredible.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.020
Yeah,

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.620
you only graduated six months ago,

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.040
and you're moving up

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.100
the ladder already?

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.120
Just luck, I guess.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.840
You really kept that under wraps.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.500
A move that big,
and you didn't tell us a thing?

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.160
Rong,

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.320
how come you didn't tell me?

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:47.760
You guys really know
how to play it cool.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.920
"Luck" is such an understatement.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.620
You've got the ability and the drive.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.860
Of course you'd make it.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.660
In Investment Banking,

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.920
your salary must've doubled already.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.060
I heard the year-end bonus
is well into six figures.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.580
At this pace,

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.460
in just a few years,

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.760
a million‑plus salary
wouldn't be surprising.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.080
It's really nothing.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.400
So you and Xigua

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.180
are a bit of a workplace thing.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.220
Since you're her boss,

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:20.800
you must have a background

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.760
much like the rest of us.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:22.920
An MBA, I assume?

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.400
Actually, no.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.340
I was a med student.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:29.820
What?

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.740
That's quite a jump.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.280
So why aren't you practicing?

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.220
Cut it out. You're interrogating him.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:36.940
Xigua,

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.100
you're so protective.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.380
Geez, can't I even ask a question?

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.080
I never knew

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.280
you were the jealous type.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.940
I just don't get it.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.760
Why go to med school

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.540
if you're not going to practice?

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.000
What's so strange about that?

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.800
Haven't you seen a versatile talent?

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.140
She's just not used to

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.400
this much shameless bragging.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.300
It's okay.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.960
This fish soup is really good.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.720
Have you tried it?

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.080
Not yet.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.280
Thanks.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.120
Go on, have a taste.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.140
Thanks everyone for being here.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:44.880
Here you are.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.560
- Boss.
- Boss.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.540
As we're friends,

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.980
I'm not doing the rounds, okay?

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.340
Oh, knock it off.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:49.940
We know you're

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.820
a lightweight.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.080
Let's all raise our glasses.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.000
Congrats.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.720
- Alright.
- Congrats.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.260
- Congrats.
- Congrats.
