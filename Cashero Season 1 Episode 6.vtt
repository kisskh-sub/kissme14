WEBVTT

00:42.333 --> 00:43.376
Damn it.

00:43.918 --> 00:46.921
My goddamn cute little brother
already took them all.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.258
He's fucking quick at this kind of thing.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.721
Where is that bastard right now?

00:58.224 --> 00:59.434
Get him now.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.357
That's mine!

01:14.532 --> 01:16.367
Hey, get off!

01:17.035 --> 01:18.161
Give it to me!

01:33.593 --> 01:35.678
-Back off!
-Everyone, on the ground!

01:36.429 --> 01:38.431
Turn off your phones. Now!

01:41.601 --> 01:42.769
Stay still. Get back!

01:42.852 --> 01:43.895
MUNDANE

01:44.646 --> 01:46.856
-Hey! Shut the back door!
-Come this way!

01:46.940 --> 01:49.651
-This way!
-Turn off your phones!

01:51.778 --> 01:53.488
Get on the ground. Put your hands up!

01:56.032 --> 01:57.617
Hey, be careful there!

02:02.038 --> 02:03.123
Is it a deadly weapon?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.225
Hey, this can't be all.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.894
Search everything
and take all the evidence.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.937
Yes, sir.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.234
Mister!

02:31.901 --> 02:33.153
Are you okay? Mister…

02:36.573 --> 02:37.407
Are you okay?

02:38.116 --> 02:39.617
Yeah. Hey, are you okay?

02:39.701 --> 02:41.202
Yeah. Get up. Quick.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.086
Over there! Clear the whole thing!

02:59.846 --> 03:01.598
Hey, get down.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.349
-Why?
-It's the police.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.517
-We need to go.
-Jeez.

03:07.020 --> 03:07.854
Kang Sang-ung?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.023
We need to get out.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.020
There was a pipe in the way.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.149
Here's the bag.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.692
Where are you going?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.820
The formal family meeting. I'm late.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.822
Wait!

04:02.367 --> 04:03.451
What is it?

04:17.257 --> 04:20.343
First impressions are important
when meeting your in-laws.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.770
This is what makes this work so hard.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.942
It'd be great if we could do
both things at once.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.030
For someone special,
living an ordinary life is just…

04:43.074 --> 04:44.033
too hard.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.503
Go on, hurry up.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.135
I'm off.

05:03.803 --> 05:04.637
Bye.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.722
Gosh, I can't believe this kid.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.563
What…

06:07.950 --> 06:10.536
I'm with the police.
You're Ms. Kim Min-suk, correct?

06:11.412 --> 06:13.956
Yes, that's me. What's this about?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.416
Where is Mr. Kang Sang-ung?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.546
I was about to report him missing too.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.714
So I have no idea.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.635
Mr. Kang Sang-ung is now a suspect
in a major case.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.262
-So we need your cooperation--
-Excuse me, Detective.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.933
He's a completely ordinary guy.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.645
The police believe
stuff floating around online too?

06:35.728 --> 06:39.524
Like how he gets stronger
when he's holding cash or something?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.859
Do you really think that makes sense?

06:43.569 --> 06:46.030
Superpower? That's ridiculous.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.537
You guys hiding back there!

06:55.790 --> 06:57.917
Getting paid overtime for tonight, right?

07:09.762 --> 07:10.930
Let's say…

07:11.973 --> 07:15.810
Let's say Sang-ung really does have
that kind of superpower.

07:17.895 --> 07:20.314
He's using his own money to do that work.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.946
He's using his own money to save people

07:27.738 --> 07:29.282
and catch bad guys.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.038
He's better than you.
You can't even catch them with overtime.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.082
So why arrest someone who's doing good?

07:38.666 --> 07:42.170
You're getting paid. This wouldn't
have happened had you done your job!

07:57.059 --> 07:58.060
Sorry.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.229
I told you not to be late.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.483
I'm sorry.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.705
You said everything would be fine.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.988
Man, clubs are tough. Jeez.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.792
Sang-ung will be okay, right?

09:02.875 --> 09:05.628
-I'm worried about him.
-I know.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.216
I'm not sure if he'll get their approval
looking like that.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.968
Yeah, good point.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.889
Anyway, who called the police?

09:20.059 --> 09:21.644
I thought it was you.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.147
It wasn't me.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.025
It was me.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.408
I take reporting seriously.

09:57.513 --> 09:58.347
Bun-mi.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.302
I haven't done anything wrong.

10:37.595 --> 10:41.015
I told you to stay quiet.
Come back here, and you'll end up in jail.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.229
-I heard you were part of the society.
-That's why I'm doing this.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.024
You need to follow the law.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.068
Good intentions?

10:55.112 --> 10:58.199
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.662
You're putting more people in danger.
Don't you get it?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.048
So you're just sitting here doing nothing?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.801
I wish I could

11:17.718 --> 11:19.720
stay home, watch the news,

11:19.804 --> 11:23.808
curse at bad guys when they show up,
and live my life like that too.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.061
But that's not the right thing to do.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.896
We have superpowers!

11:31.440 --> 11:34.151
Shouldn't people like us go out there
and stop the bad guys?

11:35.778 --> 11:37.196
Just like you said,

11:38.572 --> 11:40.741
before more people end up in danger.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.003
I'm recommending charges.

12:26.996 --> 12:27.997
Sang-ung.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.039
Sang-ung!

12:29.540 --> 12:30.916
Sang-ung! Wait…

12:53.898 --> 12:56.150
TO MR. KANG SANG-UNG

13:00.988 --> 13:02.239
FINAL OVERDUE NOTICE

13:03.491 --> 13:04.950
PRINCIPAL DEBT: 25,000,000 WON

13:06.368 --> 13:07.661
Twenty-five million…

13:08.496 --> 13:09.497
That crazy bastard…

13:12.249 --> 13:13.751
"Jeongja Loans."

13:26.764 --> 13:28.390
Kang Sang-ung. You have a visitor.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.560
Gosh, thank you.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.206
You look good.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.333
Comfy in there?

13:54.416 --> 13:58.087
If you're that jealous, you could join me.
The cell next door is free.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.173
I'm not used to living with others.

14:07.137 --> 14:10.808
I put so much work
into making you who you are now.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.727
You have no idea.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.069
-Please help me.
-Help you? As if.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.654
MUNDANE

14:25.155 --> 14:30.035
I admire the way you work for others
even without recognition.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.455
That's the kind of hero the world needs.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.082
HOTTEST AFFORDABLE SPEC-UP
DEALER: HERMES

14:35.165 --> 14:36.041
The bottom line is,

14:36.125 --> 14:37.918
no matter what you do,

14:39.086 --> 14:40.921
it's all part of my plan.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.473
I'll get you out at the pretrial
detention hearing this afternoon,

14:52.099 --> 14:53.684
so don't try anything stupid.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.195
Kim Min-suk.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.656
That's her name, right?

15:14.246 --> 15:16.957
If you lay a finger on Min-suk,
you're dead.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.773
JEONGJA LOANS

15:46.946 --> 15:49.406
MUNDANE

16:04.254 --> 16:05.214
What the hell?

16:27.945 --> 16:30.489
-Where are we going?
-To your pretrial detention hearing.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.371
DETENTION AND RELEASE WARRANT FOR SUSPECT

16:46.255 --> 16:48.173
Wait. These people are worse. Damn.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.564
MUNDANE

17:08.193 --> 17:09.695
Try anything, and I'll shoot.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.141
I've got to escape, no matter what.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.897
Min-suk is in danger.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.691
Arriving in five minutes.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.122
All right, this way.
Move the vehicles further in.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.832
We're controlling traffic.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.888
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
APOLOGIES FOR THE INCONVENIENCE

18:34.404 --> 18:35.864
Hold your breath.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.689
Damn, what the hell is going on?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.416
Yes, what is it?

20:09.499 --> 20:11.084
Hello, ma'am.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.337
I saw a collection notice
in my husband's name.

20:14.838 --> 20:15.672
So what?

20:17.090 --> 20:18.967
I'm the collateral, right?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.886
Seems like it happened
before you hired me.

20:24.514 --> 20:25.849
So I was wondering.

20:28.268 --> 20:31.980
Could you please kidnap me?
Your collateral is about to get hurt.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.233
No!

20:46.870 --> 20:47.996
Be quiet.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.456
Hey, stay still.

20:50.707 --> 20:51.917
You must've been scared.

21:15.816 --> 21:16.900
It's been a while.

21:29.913 --> 21:32.541
What exactly is going on here?

21:34.584 --> 21:36.044
Why are all these people here?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.509
It just happened.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.304
What?

22:00.193 --> 22:02.404
Well, this is a rather awkward situation.

22:05.198 --> 22:08.660
The holding cell
felt more comfortable than here.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.703
Jeez.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.668
You'll be cleared
in the police investigation.

22:19.671 --> 22:20.672
I did well, didn't I?

22:23.800 --> 22:24.760
I can't trust her.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.386
You may not trust me,

22:26.470 --> 22:29.348
but you can trust my hatred for Jo Nathan.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.684
I swear I hate him more than you do.

22:35.562 --> 22:38.523
As promised, I saved him.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.734
I'll tell you what I want now.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.119
Jo Nathan.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.210
Get rid of him for me.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.139
Did he really have to make it this big?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.599
What was our original goal?

23:12.682 --> 23:14.559
Wasn't it to make money quietly?

23:15.602 --> 23:17.604
The police and the media are all over us.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.107
We can't sweep this under the rug now.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.943
That uncouth brat suddenly showed up and…

23:25.404 --> 23:26.530
What the hell are you--

23:33.954 --> 23:36.039
So noisy.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.767
Jeez. What the hell is this?

23:56.268 --> 23:59.104
"When blood runs in the streets,
our coffers fill."

24:02.357 --> 24:03.608
When blood doesn't run,

24:04.776 --> 24:05.902
we make sure it does.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.450
What about Kang Sang-ung?

24:11.950 --> 24:13.660
Stalling on purpose to get him?

24:15.412 --> 24:16.329
Of course not.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.585
Father, I have a favor to ask.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.263
This is the last time.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.142
I'll handle it quietly this time.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.356
Gimhae Savings Bank.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.570
What does that have to do with
getting rid of Jo Nathan?

24:48.653 --> 24:52.115
Recently, my father stopped trusting me

24:52.199 --> 24:54.951
and moved all the original
superpower ampoules there.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.746
How do we know if that's true?

24:57.829 --> 25:00.332
I'd be the one in real trouble
if it weren't true.

25:00.415 --> 25:02.417
So just trust me. It's all been verified.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.255
Listen carefully.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.175
The generic drug will get approval soon.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.511
Once it's on the market,

25:13.011 --> 25:17.432
it'll be over for you, me, and the world.

25:19.351 --> 25:23.313
The villain is worried
about world peace right now.

25:25.857 --> 25:29.694
You want us to steal the ampoules to stop
Jo Nathan from developing the drugs?

25:29.778 --> 25:32.155
It was yours to begin with. Take it back.

25:39.162 --> 25:42.582
I'll give you the location
of the secret vault you need to go to.

25:45.961 --> 25:46.795
Hello.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.297
It may seem like an ordinary bank,

25:49.381 --> 25:51.800
but the Mundane Vanguard
stores everything there.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.763
It means security is just as tight.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.640
Staff are with the Mundane Vanguard.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.434
If you get exposed, things will get messy.

26:06.106 --> 26:10.902
This will give you easy access
to the private vaults on B1.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.620
What you see behind that

26:22.122 --> 26:23.415
is the secret vault.

26:26.001 --> 26:29.504
Oh, that's right. There is one problem.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.967
The secret vault only opens
with my dad's biometric data.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.775
But you guys are special.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.402
You'll be fine, right?

26:57.574 --> 26:59.284
You guys save the world,

26:59.367 --> 27:02.245
Jo Nathan gets kicked out, and I…

27:06.583 --> 27:09.002
I go back to my original position.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.678
JO ANNA
HEIR TO BEOMHA GROUP

27:19.387 --> 27:22.599
-Are you sure Jo Anna isn't playing us?
-Of course she is.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.976
She's using us to take Jo Nathan down

27:25.060 --> 27:27.937
and steal back the superpower ampoules
once we secure them.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.482
And then she'll take us to Jo Won-do.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.943
Jo Anna will definitely show up.
We've got to shake her off first.

27:35.904 --> 27:39.157
So why did you agree to go,
knowing all that?

27:46.247 --> 27:48.249
Because it's worth the risk.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.840
Just like Jo Anna said,
if we steal the ampoules,

27:55.924 --> 27:57.884
we can stop what Jo Nathan's trying to do.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.264
Plus, that vault in Gimhae
is the heart of the Mundane Vanguard.

28:06.476 --> 28:07.435
Money.

28:10.814 --> 28:14.150
Ever since the Mundane Vanguard
found out about your superpower,

28:14.234 --> 28:16.277
they have probably been stockpiling cash.

28:17.153 --> 28:20.407
We will find that and burn it all.

28:23.618 --> 28:26.246
If we do it right,
we can shut down the Mundane Vanguard.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.421
So why did you say you'd go, mister?

28:36.798 --> 28:37.924
As for me,

28:39.509 --> 28:41.803
I'll be able
to get rid of that bastard Jo Nathan.

28:43.763 --> 28:44.597
That's all.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.184
That's more than enough.

28:53.523 --> 28:56.526
Once we go inside,
I'll check where the security cameras are…

29:04.826 --> 29:05.660
Don't go.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.414
Why not?

29:11.583 --> 29:13.877
Don't you get
what the whole conversation is about?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.295
You guys are the bait.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.131
Well, have we ever not been?

29:19.591 --> 29:21.342
-I still need to go.
-Kang Sang-ung.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.597
What?

29:32.520 --> 29:33.521
FINAL OVERDUE NOTICE

29:35.732 --> 29:38.359
-Hey, why do you have this?
-I work here.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.863
-Why would you work there?
-Why not?

29:47.911 --> 29:49.662
You took out a loan behind my back,

29:50.955 --> 29:52.624
ruined our family meeting,

29:52.707 --> 29:55.627
got me held as your collateral,
and now we're out of money.

29:55.710 --> 29:59.047
I'm fine with all of that.
We can earn the money and pay it back.

29:59.547 --> 30:02.634
It'd be less of a problem
if you got stronger using your own money.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.552
But Sang-ung, this is

30:06.304 --> 30:07.514
different.

30:13.394 --> 30:17.482
It's about risking our lives
fighting bad guys.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.151
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.041
Min-suk.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.336
I want to live a normal life too.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.090
Quiet and happy with you.

30:44.175 --> 30:47.095
Wake up in the morning
and go to work together.

30:48.054 --> 30:51.975
Come home from work
and eat dinner together.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.271
I really want to live like that too.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.315
But?

30:59.899 --> 31:01.150
That's why I'm going.

31:05.488 --> 31:06.322
And…

31:11.452 --> 31:13.162
And it's not just about us.

31:16.708 --> 31:21.212
I want everyone else out there
to live an ordinary, safe,

31:22.171 --> 31:24.549
and happy life, one day at a time.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.683
It's my job.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.145
It's something only I can do.

31:54.203 --> 31:55.330
How much do you need?

32:00.585 --> 32:04.047
For you to go
and finish the job, the vault and all,

32:05.006 --> 32:06.424
how much will you need?

32:10.637 --> 32:12.305
JEONGJA LOANS

32:21.272 --> 32:22.106
What is it?

32:28.738 --> 32:30.281
EXPENSE REPORT

32:31.658 --> 32:32.784
PAYMENT: CASH
KIM MIN-SUK

32:32.867 --> 32:35.036
OPERATING EXPENSES: 30,000,000

32:37.997 --> 32:40.041
Why should I give you money?

32:40.124 --> 32:43.753
Sang-ung needs to go to Gimhae tomorrow,
but he says he has no money at all.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.632
What's that got to do with me?

32:47.715 --> 32:51.803
The address that Sang-ung mentioned
looked familiar.

32:52.303 --> 32:53.972
It may seem like an ordinary bank,

32:54.055 --> 32:56.891
but the Mundane Vanguard
stores everything there.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.601
148-31 BUGOK-DONG GIMHAE SAVINGS BANK

33:00.019 --> 33:01.980
Initial address of Jeongja Loans.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.357
HEAD OFFICE MOVED
FROM 148-31 BUGOK-DONG, GIMHAE-SI

33:06.484 --> 33:08.945
JEONGJA LOANS

33:18.538 --> 33:21.541
You planned to send Sang-ung here
from the start, didn't you?

33:21.624 --> 33:23.251
That's why you approached him.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.131
You know what?

33:31.092 --> 33:34.137
He said he'd go because he's kind.
But I can't just let him.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.597
I don't want to know the details.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.225
But if you want to boss him around,
at least pay him.

33:40.393 --> 33:41.519
Or else…

33:45.898 --> 33:46.983
I won't let him go.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.998
One thing's for sure.
Kang Sang-ung married well.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.387
LEE JEONG-SU, HEAD OF JBC
PRO-BEOMHA

34:19.515 --> 34:21.017
JBC IGNORING BEOMHA'S HIRING SCANDAL!

34:21.100 --> 34:23.436
Shouldn't people like us go out there
and stop the bad guys?

34:23.519 --> 34:25.980
Before more people end up in danger.

34:30.526 --> 34:31.694
This little bastard.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.073
He doesn't even know what he's doing.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.829
-Yes?
-The report on the club incident.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.790
Shouldn't we strengthen the investigation

34:43.873 --> 34:46.000
and request a new warrant
for Kang Sang-ung?

34:48.211 --> 34:49.045
Of course.

34:49.670 --> 34:53.091
Jeez, I wonder if Kang Sang-ung has
some kind of connection with Beomha.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.720
Both the ranch and the club
where he was seen are owned by Beomha.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.224
BEOMHA RANCH FIRE

35:01.307 --> 35:02.517
DATE: APRIL 23, 4 P.M.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.935
BEOMHA RANCH, HWASEONG

35:04.894 --> 35:06.646
MECENAT CLUB DRUG CASE
OWNED BY BEOMHA

35:07.647 --> 35:09.232
JEONGGYE-DONG FIRE AND BRAWL CASE

35:09.315 --> 35:11.025
BEOMHA RANCH FIRE

35:11.109 --> 35:13.069
MECENAT CLUB DRUG CASE

35:23.996 --> 35:24.831
You guys.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.166
Ever heard of "back meat"?

35:27.875 --> 35:28.751
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

35:29.752 --> 35:31.254
When you butcher a pig,

35:31.337 --> 35:34.382
you get neck, ribs, loin, tenderloin,
and cuts like that, right?

35:34.465 --> 35:37.760
But between all that, you get scraps
that don't belong to any cuts.

35:38.719 --> 35:39.554
That's what it is.

35:40.721 --> 35:41.764
And?

35:44.433 --> 35:46.561
How about some "back meat" tomorrow?

35:47.061 --> 35:48.187
Where to?

35:50.273 --> 35:51.107
Gimhae.

35:58.739 --> 35:59.740
What is it?

36:03.035 --> 36:03.953
It's 30 million.

36:04.787 --> 36:06.205
Where did you get this?

36:06.914 --> 36:07.748
I don't know.

36:11.335 --> 36:14.046
I just want all of this
to be over already.

36:16.090 --> 36:18.426
When you're done with work and come back,

36:19.385 --> 36:21.053
I'll tell you something fun.

36:22.263 --> 36:25.266
Come on, can't you just tell me now?

36:25.349 --> 36:26.184
Nope.

36:26.684 --> 36:29.103
I'll tell you when you're back.

36:34.275 --> 36:35.109
All right.

36:35.860 --> 36:36.694
I'll be back.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.154
See you later.

36:38.779 --> 36:39.864
Thank you for this.

37:03.804 --> 37:05.389
Are you sure this is the place?

37:05.473 --> 37:08.100
GIMHAE SAVINGS BANK

37:08.184 --> 37:09.185
The heart?

37:10.228 --> 37:11.187
It looks so run-down.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.316
Outside, it's just an ordinary rural bank.

37:16.609 --> 37:19.028
Inside, it's the most secure facility
in the country.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.215
Once they're out with the ampoules,
catch them.

37:40.883 --> 37:44.553
I should wrap all three of them nicely
and deliver them to Dad.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.015
But if things get weird in the middle,

37:48.849 --> 37:51.936
we need to catch Kang Sang-ung
before Jo Nathan does.

38:10.871 --> 38:12.248
No matter what happens,

38:12.873 --> 38:14.792
I'll be the winner of this game.

38:19.088 --> 38:23.676
Yes, ma'am. Take this,
and I'll take care of that for you.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.346
Can I help you?

38:31.976 --> 38:33.853
Please come this way.

39:10.890 --> 39:14.643
Given the overall context,
we're clearly the bait.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.008
Let's get started.

39:49.887 --> 39:54.016
Customer number 15,
please come to counter two.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.187
Now that it's come to this,

39:58.687 --> 40:01.148
I'll be the perfect bait.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.155
Hello, sir. How can I help you today?

40:08.906 --> 40:10.741
I'm looking into getting a loan.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.326
May I see your ID, please?

40:15.663 --> 40:18.249
I'm Kang Sang-ung.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.145
-What is it?
-Please leave! Now!

40:47.236 --> 40:48.863
Fuck!

40:54.118 --> 40:55.828
GIMHAE SAVINGS BANK

41:16.182 --> 41:17.725
Mr. Gi. Use the back door.

42:00.684 --> 42:01.560
Is this all of you?
