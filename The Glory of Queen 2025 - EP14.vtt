[Episode 14]

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.620
My Lady.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.340
Eldest Young Master,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.300
I'm going to the fragrance shop.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.460
I'll go with you.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.020
I'm free anyway.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.980
It'll be a good chance
to lend you a hand

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.620
and learn a thing or two.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.740
Who knows, it might even help me
assist you in the future.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.420
All right.

[Pei's Fragrance Shop]

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.900
Miss, we happen to have an incense here

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.260
that's perfect for the study.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.980
It helps refresh the mind.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.460
Thank you, Eldest Young Master.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.860
Glad to help, My Lady.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.820
Lady Song and Eldest Young Master
are newlyweds.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.020
They seem so happy together.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.100
You're new here,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.140
so you probably don't know.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.580
Back then, Lady Song used to be
by Second Young Master's side.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.100
Seeing them together

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.700
made everything around them
seem to pale in comparison.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.820
They looked like a match made in heaven.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.340
But who would have thought
that in the end, Lady Song married…

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.140
Thank you.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.740
So, Eldest Young Master
is staying close to Lady Song

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.540
to guard against…?

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.580
Enough now.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.420
We still have customers here.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.420
Why is he being so clingy today?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.140
Miss.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.940
There are some other fragrance products
on that side.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.900
You can take a look around,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.460
and ask the shopkeeper
if you need anything.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.580
Eldest Young Master,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.740
I'm planning

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620
to visit the countryside estate later.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.020
Most of the workers there are women,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.340
so it might be inconvenient.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.940
I'll have Guanyan escort you back first.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.220
There are always violent incidents
at the countryside estate each year.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.940
Since you've just joined
the Pei household,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.540
I'll go with you,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.540
so those unruly servants
don't overstep their bounds.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.380
Eldest Young Master, we both know

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.540
that our cooperation
is purely a matter of mutual benefit.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.980
You really don't have to go this far.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.940
But you are my wife.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.580
Um… I need to talk to you
about something.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.700
Since Jingheng
has something to discuss with you,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.980
you two should talk. I'll wait outside.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.020
No... No need.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.180
I… I still have some things
to take care of.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.220
I don't have much time.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.700
I'll go to the countryside estate now.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.700
You're all sweaty, Jingheng.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.140
Here. This should help you cool down.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.100
You...

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.580
You've made an excellent choice.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.500
Jasmine-scented balm, our new product.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.100
The more you buy,
the bigger the discount.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.180
Carry on, everyone.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.340
It's nice to see the shop bustling.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.940
Farewell.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.700
Someone!

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.300
Yes, sir.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.540
Take this away.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.260
Yes.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.180
What a nuisance.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.940
Remove this as well.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.660
Yes.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.340
Remove this as well.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.260
Yes.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.820
Don't let me see

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.140
these paired items again.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.740
What's wrong?

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.900
Nothing.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.780
Wait.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.110
You're acting like this
and you say nothing's wrong?

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.900
What's the matter?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.540
All right, let me ask you this.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.300
What was going on with the groom today?

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.140
Groom?

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.380
I remember now.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.660
He delivered some medicine to me.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.820
The way he looks at you isn't innocent.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.100
As a man myself,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.460
I know what men are like.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.620
He's got ulterior motives.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.100
He knows you're soft-hearted

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.180
and wants to be your concubinus.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.780
Why would you think like that?

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.300
His intentions are so obvious.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.500
How could I not overthink it?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.020
Jinglan, what's all this about?

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.900
Jingheng? Why are you also here?

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.780
I...

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.260
I'm getting soaked in the rain, Jinglan.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.740
You don't know this,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.940
but something went wrong at the shop.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.020
And I'm here
to confront the one to blame.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.540
What do you mean?

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.940
What do I mean?

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.300
Listen.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.780
The steward from Lu County's Cheng Manor

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.220
has already come to the shop,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.700
questioning us

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.420
about why the fragrance powder
wasn't delivered.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.260
Only upon investigation did we find
that it went through you

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.380
and was sent to the Zhao Manor
in Qingshui County.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.340
That's impossible.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.420
Impossible?

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.580
The facts speak for themselves,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.740
and you can't deny it.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.020
You two...

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.940
Pei Jingheng,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.140
I think you're simply unhappy

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.020
seeing me take charge

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.500
of Pei's Fragrance Shop.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.380
Did you hear that?

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.780
I'm telling you,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.540
I am not someone
who can't tell right from wrong.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.340
Also,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.540
don't think you can use your excuses
to cover up your mistakes.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.500
The person is right there in the shop.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.220
Why don't you
go confront him face-to-face?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.020
Fine, I'll go.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.980
I won't let you falsely accuse me.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.780
- Go on then.
- Let's go.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.380
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.780
- Let's go.
- "Falsely accuse?"

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.420
- It's raining.
- Let's go.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.660
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.220
- I'll confront him myself.
- You think I'd falsely accuse you?

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.020
How ridiculous!

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.340
[Pei Manor]

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.340
Not bad. You play your part well.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.460
Of course.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.180
You're quite good
at spinning stories too.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.700
Just a few days ago, you were so close
while making fragrances.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.420
And now,
you've already grown tired of Jinglan?

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.900
I guess your feelings for him

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.580
were short‑lived.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.780
You...

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.980
Could it be that your heart
already belongs to someone else,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.620
and you've grown tired of Jinglan?

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.060
You didn't come to see me

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.100
just to talk about this, did you?

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.380
As expected, you know me well.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.140
There's an old saying:

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.700
"A mother knows her child best."

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.540
Second Young Master,
why have you stopped smiling?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.740
Are you just not a cheerful sort
by nature?

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.820
All right. Just tell me.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.220
Why did you come to see me?

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.500
Whether it's the countryside estate

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.540
or the counterfeit workshop,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.100
every piece of evidence points to Aunt.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.580
And yet, she can still

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.700
confidently promise Grandmother

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.220
that she will get to the bottom of this.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.140
So, tell me…
what's really going on here?

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.340
Pei Jingheng,

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.740
this fragrance feels very familiar.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.580
It contains storax.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.220
As well as wild angelica, clove,

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.620
and...

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.700
ambergris!

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.100
This ingredient is both scarce

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.340
and precious.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.020
Even in the incense
sold by the Pei family,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.140
it's rarely included.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.540
Aunt Ping, it smells amazing.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.780
I'm utterly enchanted by it.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.140
Do you find this fragrance quite unique?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.460
That's right.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.940
This fragrance smells even better
than the previous ones.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.820
Did you add some special ingredients?

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.900
Zhiyao, your nose is really sharp.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.740
Yes, I added a very special ingredient

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.740
called ambergris.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.740
Aunt Ping, this incense smells so good.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.220
If you sold it,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.300
you'd definitely make a fortune.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.300
This incense recipe isn't for sale.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.740
Why not?

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.340
For one, ambergris is so precious

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.700
that ordinary people

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.380
couldn't afford incense made with it.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.780
For another,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.820
this particular recipe

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.620
holds a special meaning for me.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.780
This is Aunt Ping's incense recipe.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.060
Yet if it's not meant to be sold,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.340
how did it appear

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.900
in the Pei family's
counterfeit workshop?

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.260
Zhiyao.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.060
Zhiyao?

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.740
Given how rare ambergris is,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.060
any incense made from it

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.340
definitely wouldn't be sold
to the common folk.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.900
So… this is what you were thinking about
just now?

00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:30.315
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.140
Yes.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.140
Don't you find it strange?

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.900
If it's not sold to ordinary people,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.340
what's it used for?

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.820
I suspect your aunt
is embezzling family funds.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.660
We can't let her get away with it.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.820
Let's hurry back to the manor and check.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.220
There may be more evidence.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.700
Is there nothing more
you wish to tell me?

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.660
Zhiyao,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.700
I truly want to help you,

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.620
but even now I don't know
what you're trying to do.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.900
I don't know how to help you.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.140
Let me share this burden with you.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.940
All right?

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.020
Aunt Ping is still missing,

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.620
and you're a member of the Pei family.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.460
How could I possibly take that risk?

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.340
For this matter,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.380
I can only rely on myself.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.900
Even though my aunt isn't in the manor,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.580
she has many eyes and ears
within her courtyard.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.820
If we go in rashly, we'll alert her.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.820
I can wait,

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.740
but Aunt Ping cannot.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.780
I can't bet on Pei Xiuning's kindness.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.100
We can just find a pretext, can't we?

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.340
You cover for me,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.580
and I'll slip into her study.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.820
No one will notice.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.180
Have more people sent out
to look for her.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.620
What happened?

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.180
I originally thought your aunt
had been staying at her paramour's place

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.100
and was unwilling
to return to the manor.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.620
But two whole days have passed,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.180
and only when I sent someone
to check did I learn

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.540
that she had returned long ago.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.620
But now,

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.260
she's nowhere to be found.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.340
Stop mumbling

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.380
and stammering.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.220
Speak!

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.420
Madam,

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.420
as you know,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.020
my wife has several paramours outside.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.980
When she's in a bad mood,

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.500
she often stays out overnight.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.140
So when she didn't return
the night before last,

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.700
I assumed that was the case.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.580
But…

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.780
But she didn't come back
last night either.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.220
You should have searched for her
last night.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.780
Normally,

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.900
she always says I'm useless
because I can't have children,

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.980
so I didn't dare send anyone
to fetch her at night.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.700
This morning, I sent someone to check

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.300
and learned she had returned
to the manor the night before last.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.580
But she's nowhere to be found,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.540
and that's when I started to worry.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.020
As a husband,

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.020
your own wife has been gone
for two nights,

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.380
and you don't even know where she is.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.700
You are not fit to be a husband!

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.500
Madam, the truth is that my wife

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.740
simply doesn't like
being restricted on such matters,

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.580
which is why I…

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.700
What did she say
before she left the manor two days ago?

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.940
Think carefully!
Don't leave out a single detail.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.100
Yes.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.380
The afternoon before yesterday,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.340
my wife returned to the manor in haste.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.740
Noticing she was in a good mood,

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.100
I couldn't help asking a little more.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.540
Why are you so happy, My Lady?

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.220
Those two greenhorns
think they can outmaneuver me?

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.420
This time, I'll make sure

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.940
they never get the chance
to turn things around.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.420
So you've found a fault
in Eldest Master's line, My Lady?

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.300
Calling it a "fault"
would be an understatement.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.940
This alone

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.780
could drag them into total ruin.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.900
We're now only one step away

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.540
from catching them red‑handed.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.180
Well then, My Lady,
congratulations in advance.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.500
Don't worry.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.740
Over these years,

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.420
even though you haven't been able

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.140
to give me a son or daughter,

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.940
your efforts haven't gone unnoticed.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.300
When I inherit the family estate,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.180
you will still be my husband.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.740
Even if I have children
with others in the future,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.380
they will be considered yours.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.780
I always knew

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.580
you

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.020
treated me best, My Lady.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.580
What are you waiting for?

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.580
Hurry and go look for her!

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.620
Yes.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.100
Chief, the Pei family's lady is missing.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.300
Why are you helping to look for her?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:17.720
Exactly.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.380
She was the one
who had people kidnap you before.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.780
Stop talking.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.820
I suspect

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.940
that Pei Xiuning is the one
who murdered my parents.
