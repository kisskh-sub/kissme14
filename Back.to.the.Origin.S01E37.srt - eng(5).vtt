00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.759
Ma'am, should you or I

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.640
take Nian to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.160
extracurricular class today?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.120
After deliberation, I still don't think

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.920
fake wife scheme

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.920
would work.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.120
Me, neither.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.440
Lady Wan said

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.280
that there must be a 'wife',

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.039
but it cannot be Zhang Ran.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.600
What should I do?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.760
I told her that this will

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.600
be the last time they pretend

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.320
to be a couple in live stream.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.640
She promised.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.880
Can't you see how much

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.760
this will affect

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.760
their marriage?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.920
The actors

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.520
playing couple also have

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.000
their own real-life partners.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.200
You're hilarious.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.680
In this scheme,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.360
they're just acting

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.160
as a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.280
so-called couple.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.040
Yudong told me

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.560
that Zhang Ran accepts it.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.320
You can call her

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.360
and see for yourself.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.960
Shall I call for you?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960
That's nonsense.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.920
Did she have any other choice?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.040
How could that be nonsense?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.800
Everyone else is fine with it.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.400
Why

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960
are you still making a fuss?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.200
What? Make a fuss?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.320
Aren't you?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.080
I'm so sorry.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.400
I shouldn't, okay?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.840
I won't care about

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.880
your business anymore.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.160
Do whatever you want.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.640
Okay?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.400
I'm so sorry.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.840
You won't hear anything from me.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.240
That's it.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.760
I'll take Nian to extracurricular class.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.800
I already told you yesterday that

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.840
today's class is canceled.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.360
You never seem to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.320
care about these.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.520
I thought you're scared of heights.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.920
Why do you keep

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.840
going up here?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.720
I'm adjusting to

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.480
our current altitude.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560
After checking the batch

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.760
of goods for Lady Wan,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.600
I find myself

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.600
standing higher

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.200
and seeing farther now.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.200
Arguments with Cheng Man

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.600
used to leave me low for days.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.960
Now I shrug it off right away.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.160
You two had a fight?

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.280
Just a spat.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.160
She's a good wife,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.920
way better than Zhang Ran.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.320
What? Do you have

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.120
any grievances against

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.720
your real wife?

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.200
Get lost.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.560
What happened?

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.440
Nothing.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.760
C'mon, tell me.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.800
Don't want to say.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.120
Then I'll

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.760
call her myself.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.720
Enough.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.720
I've taken the brunt myself.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.320
You don't

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.280
want to get yelled at by her.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.480
Did something bad happen?

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.600
No.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.240
Anyway, get the work sorted out.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.920
Everything will be fine.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.640
Yudong.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.880
Looks like your horizons

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.520
have also broadened.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.200
Who in the world

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.360
can control our destiny?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.440
Of course, it's ourselves!

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.480
Zhang Ran,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.480
let me introduce.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.320
This is the

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.680
owner and director of the production

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.120
company of our online show.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.400
Nice to meet you, sir.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.120
Glad to meet you.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.560
Well,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.840
let me introduce

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.760
our project.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.600
We are a new video

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.760
production company.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.840
This will be our first

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.159
variety show video.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.000
We only

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.440
invited renowned guests.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.240
Now, we need

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.920
a well-known streamer

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.800
to inject

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.880
some vitality

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.440
into the show.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.760
We actually like

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.840
your online

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.680
persona and

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.920
live streaming style.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.400
So,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.560
I reached out to Mr. Lin,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.920
and I'd like to invite you

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.600
to join us.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.000
I wonder if you're interested.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.880
First, thank you for your invitation.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.320
But I don't know

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.880
what to do on a reality

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.560
show.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.720
I've never been

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.880
on a show like this before.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.000
It's simple.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.280
Just play up your usual

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.040
desperate persona

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.800
with exaggerated,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.760
comedic actions.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.520
That'll be fine.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.880
Like the class clown, right?

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.720
You can put it that way.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.520
Zhang Ran.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.960
This show features

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.360
movie star, singer, and even

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.680
multi-talented entertainers.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.600
You are

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.000
the representative of influencers.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.040
Everyone has their role

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.240
to play.

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:42.240
But...

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.800
Ran doesn't

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.880
rely on gimmicks for attention.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.080
She's positioned

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.120
as an independent woman.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.159
If what you're looking for is reasonable,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.400
we'd be very open

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.960
to collaborating.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.120
Well, okay.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.720
Fine by me.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.760
That'd be great!

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.440
Would you

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.800
like to review the process

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.880
and the proposed direction

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.240
for your role?

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.040
Sure.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.560
Okay?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.280
Thank you once again.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.680
I look forward to working with you.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.680
Thank you.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.840
When did you come back?

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.640
Just now.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.160
I'll head to the office.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.200
I'll be in Lady Wan's

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.360
live stream room.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.360
Li Daoqi and I

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.880
rented a room near the company

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.000
for convenience.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:03.880
Okay.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.240
And you can get to know

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.160
your fake wife better.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.600
What do you mean?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.320
Nothing.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160
Anyway,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.800
I've been booked for a variety show.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.680
The filming starts tomorrow.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.360
I'll stay there.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.600
What's that?

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.400
Fine.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.640
I'll know it from your live stream.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.840
I'm used to it anyway.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.760
Fu Yudong,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.640
do you think

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.960
we can keep going

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.040
like this?

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.120
What do you think?

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.280
I'm exhausted.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.040
Me too.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:42.960
Don't forget

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.120
to change into your slippers.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.520
It's live time.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.920
Busy with work,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.160
so I won't be

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.800
coming home tonight.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.600
Good luck.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.040
Wait.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.520
You know...

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.440
Well,

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.120
we'll talk tomorrow.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.280
Bye.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:12.880
Zhang Ran.

the other guests are older.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.160
Is that a full-time job?

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.000
That's enough.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.640
I'm just asking.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.640
Is he your partner?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.880
No, he's my boss.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.040
Nice to meet you.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.640
Does your company

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.680
provide health

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.680
insurance for you?

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.960
Stop asking!

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.640
I'll go bring

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.360
those suitcases

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:20.840
inside.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.200
It's heavy.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:22.600
I'll take it myself.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.280
It's okay.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:23.720
I'll take it.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.080
I've been working out.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.440
I can do it.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:25.920
Let me help.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.480
I can do it.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:26.880
He didn't

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.640
help when we arrived.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.760
Why didn't you take

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.400
our luggage when we arrived?

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:30.960
Guangfa,

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.160
you arrived before me.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:34.960
Tell Haoran

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.760
to begin the pairing task.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.480
Yes, sir.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:38.840
Action!

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.480
Is this task just for the two of us?

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.320
What about the others?

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.800
They need to

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.640
tidy up the room.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.440
We should

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.520
get the ingredients.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.920
I can also show you around.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.840
Okay. Let's go then.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.200
Yep.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.240
I got an umbrella.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:51.800
I don't need it.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.080
It's too hot. I'll hold it for you.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.160
No. I can bask in the sun.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.520
I don't get enough sun exposure.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.800
Sunlight helps to produce vitamin D.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I'm okay with it.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.400
Well, Ran.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.600
When I arrived,

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.960
I took a photo

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.760
with this sign

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.840
it turned out really well.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.440
I'll take

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.520
some photos of you too,

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.400
so you can use them

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.080
for your videos.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.840
Shouldn't we go get the ingredients?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.040
It won't take long.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.600
Okay.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.760
Here, Ran.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.040
Here?

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:15.680
Yes.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.320
This is truly stunning.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.320
The clouds feel close.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.680
Ran, change your pose.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.960
One photo is enough.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.760
We can do it after we're back.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.440
Hurry go.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.440
Or we won't

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.800
have dinner.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.400
Okay.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.840
Do you want water? I brought some.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.160
No, I've already had some.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.320
Look.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.120
You can keep it for yourself.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.840
I don't see the romance.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.800
Camera B,

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.760
pay attention to

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.720
Zhang Ran's reaction.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.680
If it's not satisfactory,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.920
quit the close-up of her face

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.280
and switch to filming

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.080
scenes where the two

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.880
might appear intimate.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.200
What's following?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.960
Did you give them the props?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.600
Yes.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.600
Thanks.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.120
Are you hungry?

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:58.920
I...

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.520
They gave me

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.880
potato chips.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.320
They say this is delicious.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.360
It's for kids.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.080
Do not litter.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.360
It is not environmentally friendly.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.760
I didn't know.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.160
This is from the

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:16.640
film crew.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.040
Is that your idea?

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.040
No.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.400
Yours?

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.080
No.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.160
No, don't

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.920
put your hand

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.480
there.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:27.760
I'm okay.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.320
You have great chemistry.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.920
No wonder you carried her suitcase.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.800
As the saying goes, a team of both

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.640
men and women is more...

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.280
Efficient!

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.440
Guangfa, take this.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.560
Light it up

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.200
in a moment.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.280
Is this a romance reality show?

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.040
Romance.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.320
I'll just go ahead then.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.080
Okay.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.160
I'll try this.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.160
I'll get some.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.160
I'll serve you the soup.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:45.720
I'll do it myself.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.760
Let me do it for you.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.000
Here.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:49.880
The soup.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.680
Who made the chicken wings?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.360
Squash and egg soup.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:51.800
I did.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.880
It's pretty good.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.240
You're too humble.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.120
This is really tasty.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:56.800
Haoran,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.880
my assistant just told me

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.840
your movie crossed the billion-yuan mark

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.000
at the box office today.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.040
I only had a cameo

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.720
in that movie.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:04.960
It's also an honor.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.480
Thanks.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.320
Isn't being an influencer

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.920
exhausting too?

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.760
There is no rest time.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.720
No, it's much

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.160
easier than commuting

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.760
to work.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.040
She doesn't have to

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.760
commute or work

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.200
overtime at night.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:16.880
She can

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.440
get up

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.240
whenever she wants.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.320
This job isn't easy.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.200
She has to write jokes.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.920
Well, think back.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.120
Didn't you need to practice

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.400
singing every morning?

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.000
Indeed.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.600
What about her?

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.720
She doesn't have to get up

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.480
early to practice making memes.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.720
But she has to make new faces

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.560
everyday.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.640
Easier than going to work.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.240
She uses simple facial

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.200
features to create

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.800
so many expressions.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.720
But I...

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.360
Not that many.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.760
One set can earn her

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.720
enough money, really.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:42.960
I know a chubby kid

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.160
who's just like that.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.600
Yeah.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.200
It's not that easy, I tell you.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.360
She has to write scripts

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.240
every day.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.120
And the film crew...

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.200
Look at her boss there.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.760
He's been recording

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.400
the whole dinner.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.200
Who knows if he's playing

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.760
with his phone?

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.160
He doesn't even

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.120
have time to eat.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.680
Not everyone is like you,

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.600
becoming famous

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.280
after just a few videos.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.600
Zhang Ran, Ms. Wei hasn't seen

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.440
your expressions

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.400
of your memes in flesh.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.280
Go ahead and show us.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:08.600
Embarrassed?

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.880
Don't get me involved!

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.960
Fine. I want to see it.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.480
Unbelievable.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.120
Those are candid shots.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.000
It won't work if I do it intentionally.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.360
If that weren't the case,

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.360
everyone could be famous.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.080
How reserved!

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.120
She's being reserved.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.560
Yeah.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.960
Don't be too hard on her.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.830
I... I didn't.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.510
How about my loofah soup?

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.400
Not bad, huh?

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.030
Loofah soup?

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.640
I'm taking another slurp.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.720
Ran, I don't quite belong here

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.830
if not for you.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.200
I... didn't put my foot in my mouth, did I?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.640
I got it.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.350
Don't worry.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.830
Who made this?

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:36.880
You haven't touched much.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.070
No, I have. I ate...

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.880
most of a bowl.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.400
Have some more yourself.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.750
I'm good, really.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.310
I'm good.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.030
Seriously, buddy.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.550
Thanks for the food.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:45.310
Thanks.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.550
No small feat.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.640
For sure.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.750
No more, thanks.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:49.550
Just take a bite.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.480
No, I'm stuffed.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.200
Maybe this instead?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.000
This is my dish.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.920
This is good.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.880
Have some more.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.480
You two finish those off.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.880
Yeah, it's superb.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.550
Anyone else?

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.200
Want some soup?

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.790
Let me get you.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.680
Oh, I'm good.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.160
Fantastic.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.270
Well? How is it?

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.000
You bet.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.350
I got it.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.880
Ran, right?

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.880
Yeah.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:07.880
You married?

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.400
I am.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:10.920
How old are you?

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.240
I'm... thirty-six.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:12.920
[Thirty-six.]

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.880
[Any kids?]

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.350
Don't put this part in.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.640
[Gen-Y, huh?]

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.110
I prefer Gen-Ys.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.200
At least grilling her with the right

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:22.680
questions.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:28.070
I... I'll go powder my nose.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.070
Why not go

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.640
this way?

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.830
It's a tight squeeze over there.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.480
I'm fine.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.070
Take care.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:33.920
Spin the chopstick.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.920
Let's see who's on dish duty.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.400
I'll do it.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:36.830
I got it.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.640
"Stop it, naughty."

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.680
Let's pause for a second.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.960
We need to pick up some audio.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.480
Thanks.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.880
Hold on a moment.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:47.790
Go.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:50.790
Okay?

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.240
"Stop it, naughty."

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.440
Any chance to put more feeling into it?

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.310
But I never

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.590
said it in the first place.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.920
Will the lip-sync work?

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.480
Don't worry about it.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.030
We've got great shots already.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.480
Need a bit more audio to

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.640
hype it up some more.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.920
Haoran's done his part.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.070
We'll just drop you in.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.000
Isn't this supposed to be

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.510
a chill reality show,

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.550
instead of a dating show?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.400
Why must we fake chemistry?

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.590
Zhang Ran.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.790
This is a story point from the director.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.510
Let's just play along.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.160
Look how late it is.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.160
Let's wrap this up quickly

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.550
for everyone's good.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.000
Alright.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:44.680
"N... naughty."

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.070
G... got it.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:47.200
Good. Let's resume.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200
[About the show,]

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.310
[we're fully on board.]

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.350
Look, is there any chance

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.960
we can bump Ran's fee up a bit?

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.240
I'm afraid

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.680
she's already getting the top rate

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.830
in her category.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:02.880
Really?

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:05.160
Definitely.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.880
But have you considered

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.880
that precisely 'cause she rose

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.550
to fame as an influencer,

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.720
she can

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.270
pull off shots

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.440
that other performers

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.720
might shy away from?

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.160
That's the whole point

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.590
of having her, innit?

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.880
You mean she'll be

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.550
cooperative with anything?

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.680
Okay.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:46.790
Alright.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.070
I'll see what I can do

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.350
and keep you informed.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.030
[Here, cheers.]

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:00.000
[Cheers.]

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.640
[Haoran.]

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:03.510
[You really]

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.240
[put in the work today.]

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.070
[Just doing my job.]

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.510
[Zhang Ran takes herself]

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.830
[way too seriously.]

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:11.680
[We agreed]

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.240
[upon this]

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.920
[CP marketing, didn't we?]

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.350
[Right.]

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.440
[Took all the trouble]

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.400
[dropping cues.]

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.200
[I... I said,]

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.240
["Hey, May I"]

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.160
["get that for you?"]

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.680
["Allow me."]

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.750
[She just]

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.750
[missed it all.]

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.720
[No idea what she's up to.]

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.920
[Let's be real.]

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.510
[I'm... not unattractive,]

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.270
[shipping-wise.]

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.790
[I probably have a bigger follower count.]

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:34.070
True...

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.680
Honestly...

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.270
Way bigger.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.400
And she's acting all high and mighty?

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.750
[Look,]

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.240
[she has absolutely no clue]

[where her place is.]

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.000
Yeah,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.750

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.830
Plus, tonight...

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.070
I almost forgot.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.350
She blurted out

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.960

[Hey, calm down.]

[I mean, a married woman]

[pushing this "divorced, empowered" image.]

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.200
[That's classic]

[influencer thing.]

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.720
[So I assume she]

[Maybe]

[she doesn't want to play the card]

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.880
[right out of the gate.]

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:17.510
[I'll talk to her manager]

[to ensure]

[we're on the same page.]

[Just stick to the]

[we'll still do it our way.]

[This show is]

[It's fancy here.]

[If not for work,]

[it's actually a]

[nice place to chill.]

Mr. Lin, I know we've spoken

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.550
many a time,

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.350
but I feel impelled to have another

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.720
quick word.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.920
Fire away, Director.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.440
Actually,

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.310
I'll give

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.350
the floor to Haoran.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.160
You see...

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.070
I assume you noticed

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.830
Ran's reactions today, right?

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.880
Let's just say

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.030
she's utterly

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.240
off-script.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.680
If she keeps this up,

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.110
I can't seem to play my part.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.790
And the entire CP promo

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.550
is impossible.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:46.400
I might as well

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.880
play the "pathetic admirer".

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.590
I mean, what else?

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.510
Right?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.960
Allow me to suggest otherwise.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.110
The script is perfect, no doubt.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.720
I have lectured

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.350
Zhang Ran just now.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.160
She should

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.310
know her place.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.350
What did I just say?

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.550
You gave her a lesson?

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.440
Nah.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.680
None of the kind.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.270
We were

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:14.310
just chatting away.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.590
Brought it up in passing.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.960
Yes.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.480
Rest assured, Director.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.880
Zhang Ran should feel grateful

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.920
she gets to co-star with you.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.270
Nah. It's mutual.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.400
Sorry for the trouble.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.790
All for the show.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:36.510
You're right.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.590
Ran's got a packed schedule lately.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.110
Currently on

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.790
"Life in the Slow Lane".

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.680
[That rings a bell.]

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.200
[Is Mr. Bao in?]

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.000
Ms. Wei, as well.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.640
Mr. Jin, too.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.550
[Speaking of,]

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.110
[can you get Ms. Wei's]

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.070
[autograph for me?]

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.070
[I'm her biggest fan.]

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.510
Till next episode.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.830
First,

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:20.720
about the ad.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.880
Ran's getting a bit

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.000
burned out lately.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:26.790
I'll ask her if

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:27.880
she's up to it first.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.880
Ran, I can totally picture

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.920
you shining like a diamond.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.720
Ran.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960
Keep up! You can do this!

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.110
You're just one step away

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.240
from the finish line.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.030
Morning, Ran.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.270
Making fire?

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.160
Let me do it.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.270
No. Just...

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:10.720
Allow me...

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720
Stay away from me!

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.640
What is it? Are you mad at me?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.030
Didn't we agree on

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.070
open conversation

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.920
if I ever

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.720
made a mistake?

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.000
Take your mic off.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.720
A word.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.030
I... don't think so.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.550
We can't do that on set.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:25.680
They're still filming.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.720
So you don't mind them knowing

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.720
how you badmouthed me?

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920
I thought people your age

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.270
know better than eavesdrop.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.200
What's wrong with my age?

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.310
Plus, define "eavesdropping".

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.030
If anything,

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.160
at least find a proper "eave"!

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.350
Oh, you're clever, aren't you?

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:45.880
What did I do to

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.400
deserve

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.030
all this dirt?

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.680
Oh, so you think

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.590
I'm enjoying it?

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.200
That was in the JD.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.200
Wake up, idiot!

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.000
Dude, you're dreadfully hollow.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.270
Where did that gentleman go?

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:55.920
Eh?

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.920
Once mic off

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.110
mask off!

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.110
Listen up: from now on,

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:01.750
with or without camera,

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.480
don't talk to me.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.790
Alright? Deal?

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.000
I wish I didn't have to.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.270
But

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.480
go ask your boss.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.160
What do you mean?

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.590
Go figure.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.030
Acting

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.240
all innocent.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.400
I'm not acting!

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.000
What a baby.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.240
Who's leaving again?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.720
Bro Erge?

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.070
What else have you got to report?

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.440
Your homemade recipe?

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.960
I am your boss,

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.030
not your lawyer!

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.000
Stop crying.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.240
Okay, cut it.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:45.680
I know

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.270
you've been under much pressure.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.920
Without Qian Dan around,

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.000
you're rudderless.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:54.000
Just listen up first.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.960
Zhang Ran,

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.240
come here.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.160
I'll talk to you later.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:06.790
Mr. Lin.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.350
Director wants you

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.200
and Wang Haoran

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.920
to make breakfast

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.270
after you woke up.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.640
No idea how.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:23.590
Have a seat first.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.680
I'm fine this way.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.160
How come you suddenly

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.400
forget how to cook?

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.440
Do you have an idea how many would

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.510
kill to dine with Wang Haoran?

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.750
Count your blessings.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.720
Are you saying that

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.830
he's too good to be

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.550
shipped along with me.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.350
Correct?

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.960
That's not what I mean.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.000
I'm saying you're our top talent.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.750
Mr. Lin, is this really necessary?

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.030
We're under a lot of pressure right now.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.200
Even Bro Erge has left.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.920
Look...

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.510
I don't like him.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.510
And he clearly doesn't like me.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.070
Now you want us to fake chemistry,

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.640
so we both

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.200
have to

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:06.960
scare up fondness

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:07.880
out of nowhere.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.070
The audience can

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:09.960
spot that from a mile away.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:11.670
Phony. I can't do it.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.760
Isn't everyone phony these days?

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.760
Haven't you ever lied to your parents?

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.190
Your husband?

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.670
Your friends?

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.960
If you can keep up the act,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.070
that's your skill.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.480
Who cares what's real or fake?

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.760
[Zhang Ran.]

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.360
[Deep down, you know,]

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.230
[the only "real" things]

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.550
[are the ones that you can]

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.360
[hold onto.]

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.630
[Everything else is just smoke and mirrors.]

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.590
[Yudong.]

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.320
[No pajamas of the kind you mentioned.]

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.800
But this one fits me perfectly.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:57.800
Gift it to me.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.480
Are you nuts? Take it off!

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.000
That's for Zhang Ran's live streams.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.760
Take it off now!

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.030
Don't ruin it.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.710
This is hers?

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:08.920
Kinda oversize.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.190
Two-zero, Yudong!

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.480
Why didn't you tell me?

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:15.360
Alright.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.150
Dope.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.510
When did they score?

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.550
If the score stays till

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:21.440
the second half,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.590
I win 400 yuan.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.550
Wasn't it 120?

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:25.880
400.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.760
Alright. This robe...

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.440
I have to have it.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.150
This is my lucky charm.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.000
Call Zhang Ran.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.190
Ask her if I can have it.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.630
You want it, you call.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.400
Where's your phone?

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:38.400
My phone's dead.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:39.110
Hurry up.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.070
I said, it's dead.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.110
Fine, I'll do it.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.510
Don't you dare.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.320
It's late. Don't bother her.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.110
Use mine.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.150
Chop-chop.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:47.800
I can't press the

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.550
buttons in this!

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.190
Figure it out.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.000
Asshole.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:55.320
You're getting on my nerves.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.030
Got an idea.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.190
[Hello? Li Daoqi?]

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:07.960
Hello.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.590
Zhang Ran, is that you?

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:12.760
[You two still up?]

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.510
We're watching the game.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.190
I have four pieces of good news for you.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.550
[That many?]

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.630
First one.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:23.800
Just now,

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:26.110
I...

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.760
won a sports bet!

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.280
First half just ended. 400 yuan!

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:37.360
I never win bets on the first half.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.230
But right here, right now,

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:40.320
I won 400!

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.230
Second:

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.920
Yudong just won 60 yuan

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.110
on a scratch-off!

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.400
After we

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.000
spent 300 on 'em.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.840
But still,

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:51.190
record-breaking.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.670
You see,

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.190
when underdogs like us

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.230
got our table turned,

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.800
it means your place

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.840
is blessed.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.360
And you're absolutely the lucky star.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.230
I mean it.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:04.320
Yudong must've saved the

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.840
universe

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.190
to end up being with you.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.480
He's lucky to have you.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:10.150
Really.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.150
[If you guys win when I'm not home,]

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.000
[then I shouldn't be back at all,]

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.360
[should I?]

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.440
Third.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.880
It suddenly

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.670
occurred to me

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.590
that the root cause

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.840
of your problems

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.190
is... me.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.670
Actually...

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.320
I've been meaning

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.920
to apologize.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.360
Zhang Ran.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.280
You know...

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.710
How do I put this?

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.920
Starting the company, and the...

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.880
live streaming stuff...

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.760
Yudong wasn't really on board.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.480
I'm the one

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.070
who dragged him into it.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.480
He's loyal to a fault.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.360
Probably had a hard time saying no.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.960
I knew that, but...

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.760
maybe I was just selfish.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.510
So sometimes when you two

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.960
had issues over this,

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.320
I do feel guilty.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.670
I'm sorry, Zhang Ran.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:18.920
I owe you an apology.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.590
[Li Daoqi.]

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.760
[What's between Yudong and me]

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.360
[isn't anyone else's fault.]

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.880
[It's about the two us.]

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.880
[You don't have to say sorry.]

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.510
[Even if it wasn't you,]

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.400
[there's always gonna]

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.280
[be some other friend]

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.000
[that would come to him]

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.840
[and he'd do it all the same.]

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.110
[At this point in his life,]

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.670
[he's supposed to be doing it.]

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:46.320
[He also wanna do this himself.]

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.590
[So it's not your problem.]

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.800
[Just like me.]

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.550
[At this point in my life,]

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.710
[these are my choices, too.]

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.800
[There's no right or wrong here.]

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.150
[Fu Yudong's right.]

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.000
[And so am I.]

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.230
[Let's just let things be.]

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.440
[What else can we do?]

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.110
[We've already come this far.]

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.630
You know what?

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:07.110
It's...

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:09.920
Back when Yudong was in Canada,

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.150
he called me and...

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.880
I don't know

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.880
where he's calling from,

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.360
he said he saw you

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.510
carrying a bunch of

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:18.400
shopping bags.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.760
He said at that moment, he felt...

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.960
that you deserve

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.070
a better life.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.760
He said...

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.280
he wants to

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:31.280
help you in

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.230
being the happiest person on earth.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.670
I think when he makes decisions,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.670
like you said,

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:38.590
maybe half of it

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.590
is for himself.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.670
But the other half?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.280
It might be him

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.960
trying to make it happen for you, too.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.190
[Li Daoqi.]

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.760
[I have never...]

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.670
[I have never, ever doubted]

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:55.480
[Fu Yudong's love.]

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.230
[But honestly...]

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.030
[I don't know]

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.150
[how we got here.]

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.880
[Trust me, I wonder why.]

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.070
[But I'm at a loss.]

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.670
[Sometimes...]

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.630
[Never mind.]

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.760
Say it.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.590
[I'm in the dark, too.]

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.000
Name is power.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.630
Just say it.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.510
[You guys enjoy the game.]

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.320
[It's fine. I can handle it.]

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.230
[I just need some time.]

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.150
Sometimes, you just shouldn't overthink.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:28.960
Really.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.110
I find

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.400
it strange, too.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.280
People get together

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.320
so that they can be closer

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.280
to each other.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:35.920
But when they do,

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.440
they somehow drift apart.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.480
But here's something to watch out for.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.280
Don't drift too far.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.280
Or, it's hard to come back.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:45.880
You...

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.960
[I used to think]

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.590
[it's okay if one of us]

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:49.880
[walks slightly faster.]

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.480
[The faster one]

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.760
[could just wait for the slower one.]

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.280
[The slower one]

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.670
[could just try to catch up.]

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.070
[You'd just help each other along]

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.110
[and keep moving forward.]

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.070
[But in reality,]

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:02.800
[it's really hard to do that.]

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.510
[Because you can't even tell]

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.400
[who's ahead and who's behind.]

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.630
[It's... weird.]

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.030
I've got a plan.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.630
There is a way out.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.630
[Have some rest.]

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.400
Anyway, maybe you can

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.070
both take a step back.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.070
Yudong told me

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.630
you're doing a reality show.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.510
I think even the 'realest' show

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:33.400
is still fake.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.150
Sincerity,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.550
more often than not,

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.030
is right beside you.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.590
[Isn't there any fakeness in real life?]

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.230
[Even the fakest reality show]

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.440
[has moments of truth.]

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.760
[What's real, what's fake...]

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.150
[Who can really tell, right?]

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:54.590
I agree with you.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.360
Good point.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.360
[I'm dozing off at your voice.]

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.440
[Just go to sleep.]

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.190
And the fourth thing.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.670
[Tell me.]

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.400
The most important thing.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.550
I found this amazing "turtle robe"

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.480
at your place.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.800
It fits me perfectly.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.920
Can I have it?

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.800
I heard it's yours.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:10.960
[The green one?]

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.030
[Oversize one?]

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.590
That's the one.

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:14.550
[No way, Li Daoqi.]

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.360
[It's borrowed. I have to return it.]

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.230
[Just... don't]

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.480
[get anything on it,]

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.960
[and put it back where you found it!]

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.000
[I'm hanging up.]

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.510
[Get some rest. Bye.]

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:29.510
Bye.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.190
You two...

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.480
This is complicated.
