of the same title.)

=Episode 17=

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:45.920
Today,

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.840
I, on behalf of the cult leader,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.599
will wipe out

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.079
all you crooked sects.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.799
Who are you calling a crooked sect?

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.560
You're the crooked sect.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.239
Why is it you again?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.599
Why can't it be me?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.079
Perfect timing.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:06.040
I'll wipe you out too.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.400
Min.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.479
Take care of the sect leaders.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.280
Leave the rest

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.159
to me.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.199
Still trying to play the hero?

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.660
(Invincible Golden Wheel
Combat Power)

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.159
Impossible.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.599
Why is that impossible?

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.039
Watch closely.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.879
Such powerful inner power.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.800
He can drive the Golden Wheel
with such ease.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.039
This kid

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.280
is no ordinary fighter.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.680
First he borrows strength
to counter strength.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.719
Then he fights one against a hundred.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.879
Today, my eyes have truly been opened.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.879
Young Hero,

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.800
I...

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.080
I was wrong.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.840
I...

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.560
I misjudged you.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.080
I failed to recognize true greatness.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.039
Young Hero, if you say we are a crooked sect,

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.400
then we are a crooked sect.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.039
Please, do not kill me.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.120
Thank you.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.520
Hand over the antidote.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.839
Thanks.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.040
Is it fixed?

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.199
It's fixed.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.040
Please take a look.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.680
It's as good as new.

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:44.079
Lock up

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:46.480
this fat man,
along with those two traitors.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.079
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.800
No need to trouble you two.

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:51.680
Locked up is fine,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.000
why are you making it personal?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.800
Are you not fat?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.439
You...

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.530
I'll do it myself.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.480
Chun.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.360
Thank you for stepping in earlier.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.319
You averted a catastrophe
for the martial world.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.080
True heroes are not judged
by their origins.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.959
I failed to see your true worth,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.220
and spoke without due respect.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.220
Please accept my apology.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.959
Chun, I ask for your understanding.

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:17.920
Not at all.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.839
You're too polite.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.720
Too polite.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.279
Thank you, Chun, for saving my life.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.079
I meant no offense.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.079
None taken.

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:26.680
Esteemed elders, why don't we

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.959
sit down and discuss this?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.040
In recent years, the Tianlong Cult
has grown increasingly powerful.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.360
Yet our sects have remained divided.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.680
To prevent the Tianlong Cult
from growing too powerful

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.519
and picking us off one by one,

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.920
we have long discussed
with Sect Leader Tang

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.900
the matter of appointing
a new Alliance Leader.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.720
Before you arrived,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.279
the four of us had already agreed

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.079
to recommend Sect Leader Tang
for the position.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.439
His martial skill surpasses all,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.680
and his heart is broad and fair.

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:01.639
He is capable of mediating disputes
among our sects.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:02.600
However,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.839
his age has caught up with him,

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.360
and his health is failing.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.879
This young man has inherited
Sect Leader Tang's teachings,

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.279
and now bears the sect leader's seal.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.560
I propose that

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.959
we appoint

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:15.199
this young man

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.560
as our new alliance leader.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.000
What do you all think?

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.720
Agreed.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:23.720
Me?

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:26.680
Martial Arts Alliance Leader?

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:30.120
This...

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.480
That doesn't seem appropriate.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.199
Esteemed elders,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.560
please don't tease a junior like me.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.600
The position of alliance leader

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.360
carries great responsibility.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.959
I believe you all

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.199
might want to

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.360
give it more thought.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.680
Chun,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.319
take this advice from me.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.680
This is a good thing.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.160
We shouldn't turn it down.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:53.720
Look,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.040
your abilities,

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:56.480
your martial skills,

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:57.959
and even your

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.199
kind heart,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.680
are clear for all to see.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:02.680
Young people

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.360
should step forward.

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.000
On this matter,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.879
we are all

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.240
in unanimous agreement.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.480
Come in.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.319
This is the token
of the Alliance Leader,

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:22.279
the White Jade Ring.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.759
The previous leader

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.160
came from the Langya Sect

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.680
and was my late master.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.480
He has since passed on.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.519
The position has remained vacant.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.480
Today,

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:33.839
after joint deliberation
by the major sect leaders,

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.480
this ring is entrusted

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:38.720
to the young hero Chun Ge.

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:40.600
No, really,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.120
everyone, I'm telling the truth...

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.759
Chun Ge,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.720
since Father entrusted you
with the sect seal,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.759
he must have foreseen this.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.279
Besides, the alliance leadership

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.360
has always rotated
among the great sects.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.279
Now it is our Cangqiong Sect's turn.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.160
This is the highest honor.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:17.439
(This game levels up pretty fast.)

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.680
(Alliance Leader Ring. Reputation.)
(I just became the Martial Arts Alliance Leader.)

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.519
(This is hard to believe.)

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:23.279
(This feels amazing.)

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.630
- Greetings, Alliance Leader.
- Greetings, Alliance Leader.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.720
Thank you, everyone.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.720
Thank you.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.600
Thank you.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:50.840
Mom.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.399
- Good morning, Master.
- Good morning, Master.

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:03.919
Morning.

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:06.440
You...

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.360
How did you get in?

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.900
We are here to attend to your dressing.

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:13.480
Is that really necessary?

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.960
I'm not used to this.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.000
Just put the things here.
I'll handle it myself.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.720
Master,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.300
we suggest you get used to it soon.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.720
After all, you are now the Sect Leader
of the Cangqiong Sect,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.390
and also
the Martial Arts Alliance Leader.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.519
Is this really appropriate?

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:29.039
- It is.
- Of course it is.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.120
What are you doing?

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.190
- Helping you change.
- Helping you change.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.840
Change?

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.120
Do I have to go
somewhere else to change?

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.399
Of course.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.960
(I never thought I'd see this day.)

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.120
(If only I could post this online.)

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.320
Good morning, Master.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.840
Thank you.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.570
- Good morning, Master.
- Good morning, Master.

00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:28.000
Good morning, Master.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.080
Min.

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:32.480
Good morning, Master.

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:33.320
Stop.

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:36.200
There's no need for that between us.

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:38.240
I only put on the act in front of them.

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.679
You can skip the formalities.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.970
But you are
the Martial Arts Alliance Leader now.

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:43.120
You need to be steady.

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:44.919
Steady.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.840
Master.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.540
Master. A lot of people have arrived
in the main hall.

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:51.200
- Are they here to fight again?
- No.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.360
They are all here to see you.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.159
Have you seen the new alliance leader?

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.399
No.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.759
But I heard he's very young.

00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:57.440
That's right.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.799
The Alliance Leader has arrived.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.140
- Greetings, Alliance Leader.
- Greetings, Alliance Leader.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:02.600
Hey. What are you all doing?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.559
Please, get up.

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:05.919
We have all come to congratulate

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:08.320
Sect Leader Chun
on assuming the role of Alliance Leader.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.350
We have prepared a modest gift,
as a small token of respect.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.159
We also hope the Alliance Leader
will offer guidance and instruction,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.350
for the benefit of the martial world.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.380
May the Alliance Leader
be blessed with great fortune.

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.759
- May your life and honor endure.
- May your life and honor endure.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.000
All right.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.879
Everyone,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.240
you are far too kind.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.950
We have heard that the Alliance Leader's
skills have advanced at remarkable speed.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.519
May we ask the Alliance Leader

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:30.000
if there is a method
to understanding inner cultivation.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.039
A method?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.480
Yes.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.840
My father often told me one thing.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.510
Diligence makes up for lack of talent.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.000
True skill comes from persistence.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.440
What that means is...

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.200
We understand.

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:42.799
The Alliance Leader means

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:44.320
that effort matters most.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.920
Thank you for your guidance,
Alliance Leader.

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:47.720
Yes.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.559
You are very perceptive.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.039
Disciples of the Youyou Sect
greet the Alliance Leader.

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:54.440
We humbly ask for your guidance.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.480
How should one view cultivation?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.320
Cultivation itself...

00:11:58.799 --> 00:11:59.440
It

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:00.679
must be driven by

00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:03.480
sincerity.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.000
I understand.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.720
Understand?

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.690
The Alliance Leader means

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.190
that as long as one cultivates
with true intent,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.279
great progress will follow.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.470
Thank you for your clear guidance.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.190
Disciples of Qinghe
greet the Alliance Leader.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.159
May I ask,

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:17.960
how did you cultivate
such profound inner power?

00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:28.320
Besides

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.919
building one's own foundation,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.759
one must also have

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.399
guidance from those more accomplished.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.320
- Please lead us on the path.
- Please lead us on the path.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.750
May the Alliance Leader
bring blessings to the martial world.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.660
I do not deserve such praise.

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:47.559
Thank you.

00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:48.720
Thank you.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:54.759
Seems being Master is no easy task.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:57.039
Min.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:57.960
You must be tired.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.799
I prepared a pot of herbal tea
to soothe your throat.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.280
You really thought of everything.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.360
Senior Brother is here too.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:06.559
I brought you some pastries.

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:07.919
Perfect to have with the tea.

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:13.039
What is this? It is so good.

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:15.039
Your favorite osmanthus cake.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.559
You do not remember, Ge?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.639
Yeah.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.440
I just think this osmanthus cake

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.440
is incredibly good.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.159
It tastes exactly
like the first one we ever had.

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.120
But you know,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.679
when we were kids,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.080
we insisted there be no secrets at all.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.559
No matter who it was,
even the tiniest little thing,

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:33.919
had to be told to the other two.

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:35.200
Right.

00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:40.480
Here. Have a couple more bites.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.200
Wait.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.480
Look.

00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:45.360
What do these three cakes look like?

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.279
I know. They look like
our three stones, right?

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:48.879
Right.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.320
You still keep them?

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:51.159
Of course.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:52.440
So do I.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.990
Back then, no matter how hard you trained,
you just could not get it right,

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:07.879
so Master punished you with confinement.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.840
Min and I found a huge rock,

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:13.559
trying to smash the lock
and get you out.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.399
Yeah.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.879
So this stone is a symbol

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.039
of the friendship
between the three of us.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.960
No matter where I go,
I carry it with me,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.679
because whenever I see it,

00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:23.639
I think of you two.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.879
Chun,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.120
I never imagined the little junior brother
who once needed rescuing

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.679
would become
the Martial Arts Alliance Leader.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.600
What I could not achieve,

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:38.559
you have done.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:42.879
Ge,

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:44.639
I truly believe

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:46.720
with your current mastery,

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.000
you will be able
to lead the Cangqiong Sect,

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.600
along with the four great sects,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.200
to defeat the Tianlong Cult,

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.440
and bring peace back to the people
and to the martial world.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:06.919
Su.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.000
Min.

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:12.080
I think

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.600
there is something

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.799
I have to tell you.

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:19.720
The truth is, my inner power

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.159
it... It actually comes from that sword...

00:15:22.159 --> 00:15:22.879
Master!

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:25.200
Su! Something terrible has happened!
The Langya Sect

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.720
has been ambushed by the Tianlong Cult!

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.480
What?

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.679
Save them.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.919
What happened?

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.790
Alliance Leader.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.000
Alliance Leader.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.080
No need for formalities.

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:40.080
Tell me

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.240
exactly what happened.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.790
The Tianlong Cult launched
a surprise attack on the Langya Sect,

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.000
abducted Bao Wuji,

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:47.759
and slaughtered many of their disciples.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.960
Such brutality.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960
They are clearly trying

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.480
to wipe out every sect, one by one.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.200
At this point,

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:56.879
we must strike first.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.840
Otherwise,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.919
more tragedies will follow.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.919
You must uphold justice for us,

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:02.759
Alliance Leader.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.639
You chose me as the Alliance Leader.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.200
To me, all of this

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:22.200
feels like a dream.

00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:24.039
The person I once was

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:26.320
would have believed
I was unworthy of this title.

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:30.240
But at this moment,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.000
I will no longer think that way.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.759
I now call upon all sect leaders

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:44.440
and disciples of every path

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.559
to stand with me

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.799
and march
on the Tianlong Cult stronghold.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.159
Together, we will reclaim

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.120
the peace that should be ours.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.900
(Tianlong Cult)

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.920
Alliance Leader.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.240
Something feels off.

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:48.039
Not a single person tried to stop us.

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.519
It went a little too smoothly.

00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:51.960
(We're already here.)

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.519
(No turning back now.)

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.599
Everyone inside, listen up.

00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:57.599
I am the Martial Arts Alliance Leader,

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.599
Chun Ge, Sect Leader
of the Cangqiong Sect.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.200
Have your Cult Master

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.559
Long Zhentian come out and face me.

00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:10.279
Alliance Leader.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.079
Please be careful later.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.500
(Long Zhentian, Tianlong Cult Master.
Combat Power)

00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:39.319
Long Zhentian.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.839
You abducted Bao Wuji,

00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:44.319
slaughtered the Langya Sect,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.119
acted with utter arrogance,
committed countless atrocities,

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:48.400
and shattered the peace.

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:50.200
The martial world

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.599
has long reached its limit with you.

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:55.599
Today, the five great sects stand united

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:57.119
to demand justice.

00:18:58.279 --> 00:18:59.079
Today,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.920
I will make you answer
for every drop of blood.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.480
Blood for blood.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.950
- Blood for blood.
- Blood for blood.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.500
- Blood for blood.
- Blood for blood.

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:09.799
Who do you think you are?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.279
Such bold words.

00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:12.640
(That voice.)

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.960
(It sounds strangely familiar.)

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.920
You old rascal. How dare you speak
to the Alliance Leader like that.

00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:19.680
Martial Arts Alliance Leader?

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:22.680
You fringe sects and crooked paths

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.799
picked a green kid like him

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:26.400
and call him Alliance Leader?

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:27.480
On what grounds?

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.200
Because we trust him.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:29.920
Exactly.

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:32.240
His inner power surpasses all of ours.

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:33.680
(Enough.)

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.200
(Don't hype me up like that.)

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:38.319
Inner power?

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:40.119
That makes it even more laughable.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.880
An ordinary disciple
of the Cangqiong Sect

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.440
suddenly surges in power,

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:49.000
and within days subdues sect leaders
who trained for decades.

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:50.720
Isn't that absurd?

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.440
Did you ever ask him

00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:55.240
where that power came from?

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.640
Inner power

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:04.200
needs no pedigree.

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:05.559
Only strength matters.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.440
Enough talk.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.720
Let us

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960
take him down together.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.680
That's right.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.240
Since everyone believes in me,

00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:20.039
then it is my duty

00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:23.640
to bring that peace
back to the martial world.

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.559
Kid,

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.400
your cultivation is indeed impressive.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.759
If you earned it
through your own training,

00:20:54.079 --> 00:20:56.079
you might actually deserve respect.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.680
Unfortunately...

00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.359
What do you mean?

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:00.839
I mean

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.839
you're a fraud.

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:04.000
A fraud?

00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:09.640
I haven't deceived anyone.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.799
If you've got the guts,

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:13.240
then come at me again.

00:21:14.519 --> 00:21:15.759
You didn't lie?

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:18.680
Then do you recognize me?

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:33.880
I will give you one last chance.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.119
Tell these allies of the martial world

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.799
who trust you

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.799
where your inner power truly came from.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.839
I do not care how it was obtained.

00:21:58.319 --> 00:22:00.039
As long as that power is within me,

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.119
it belongs to me.

00:22:26.759 --> 00:22:27.519
Chun,

00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:28.279
how could this be?

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.480
This cannot be true.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.079
Why would it be impossible?

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.279
A complete scoundrel like him

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.799
managed, in just a few days,

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:38.680
to deceive the entire martial world

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.880
and win your blind devotion.

00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:42.440
It is laughable.

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:52.200
He is draining
the Alliance Leader's inner power.

00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:53.279
That makes no sense.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.759
Now you are nothing but a cripple.

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:01.039
Tell them

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:04.119
why I am able
to take this power from you.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.119
Because...

00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:27.119
Because my inner power

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:31.839
was given to me by him.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.079
How could it have been given by him?

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.480
How could this happen?

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.599
How could such a thing exist?

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.759
Once, I believed

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.720
that he was
the Sword Immortal Bai Qiongyu.

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.400
So I trusted him without doubt.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.240
My inner power was given to me by him.

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:00.720
I was nothing more than

00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:03.839
an ordinary disciple
of the Cangqiong Sect.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.480
No one ever truly noticed me.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.119
The envy you now feel,

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:13.279
the praise you now speak,

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:18.119
were things
I never even dared to imagine.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.960
So,

00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:28.119
after I gained this power,

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:31.279
I cherished it all the more

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.799
and did not want to reveal the truth.

00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:36.480
I am sorry.

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:40.440
I am sorry.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.160
You all heard that, didn't you?

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.440
The so-called supreme
Alliance Leader you chose

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.440
turned out to be nothing but a fraud.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.559
A martial world like this

00:24:58.119 --> 00:24:59.960
is it not a complete joke?

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.640
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.880
Did not expect you to sink this low.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.039
Linglong Sect disciples,
heed my command.

00:25:10.599 --> 00:25:11.440
We withdraw.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.039
Wait.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.759
He may have deceived us,

00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:15.640
but the Langya Sect
still deserves justice.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.880
How can you just leave?

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.200
If we stay,

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.240
are we to let a liar decide
the fate of the martial world?

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.440
We are leaving.

00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:23.160
Move.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.200
Go.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.559
The Qinghe Sect and the Cangqiong Sect

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:33.279
have always stood or fallen together.

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:34.559
But today,

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:36.880
you have truly disappointed us.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.590
As things stand,

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:40.400
with just us here,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.119
we cannot contend
with the Tianlong Cult.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.039
We should withdraw for now

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:45.279
and plan our next move.

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:46.279
You may leave.

00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:48.960
We are staying.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.000
Retreat.

00:25:56.519 --> 00:25:59.960
You people talk about the martial world
day in and day out.

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:01.519
Is this

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:05.039
what you call the martial world?

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:09.680
They can all walk away,

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:12.119
but I cannot.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.240
The Langya Sect exists in name only now.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.720
Staying behind serves no purpose.

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:20.440
Today,

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.920
I will seek justice

00:26:25.599 --> 00:26:27.599
for the brothers who died.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.279
Sect Leader Lu!

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:42.440
You saw it yourself.

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:45.119
He did not have to die.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.680
But he trusted you.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.759
You used the inner power I gave you

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.720
to stir the sects
into opposing the Tianlong Cult.

00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:53.759
Today,

00:26:54.319 --> 00:26:55.599
I cannot let you live.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.319
Cangqiong Sect, form up.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.000
Long Zhentian.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.160
Chun Ge may be our acting sect leader,

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.160
but he is also our friend.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.039
If you dare lay
a hand on him again today,

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:09.759
the Cangqiong Sect

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:11.240
will fight you to the death.

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:14.400
Then you will all die.

00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:18.559
Wait.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.799
Your Tianlong Cult
seeks nothing but domination.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:26.960
And you

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.640
style yourself the supreme ruler
of the martial world.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.160
Yet countless sects
refuse to submit to you,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.039
because you rely solely on brute force,

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.920
wiping out other sects without mercy.

00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:39.800
There is no honor in such victories.

00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:40.720
Today,

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.480
the Cangqiong Sect

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.839
formally challenges the Tianlong Cult.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.460
On another day,
we settle this in a fight to the death.

00:27:47.839 --> 00:27:49.119
The loser submits to any fate,

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.599
willingly and without complaint.

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.200
If you win,

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.759
the other sects
will acknowledge your strength.

00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:59.960
Today, the entire martial world
gathered at my Tianlong Cult's gates,

00:28:00.359 --> 00:28:02.440
yet you scattered without a fight,
like loose sand.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.599
How is that an unearned victory?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.680
And why would I care for
the regard of ants like you?

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:09.759
This cripple,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.000
you may take him away.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.640
In three days,

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.440
the Tianlong Cult
will bathe the Cangqiong Sect in blood.

00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:19.160
We leave.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.279
Chun.

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:37.279
Cult Master,

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:39.240
why give them three days?

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.319
Fear

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:44.079
is the most insidious poison
in this world.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.559
It erodes resolve

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.839
and corrodes one's nature.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.839
These three days,

00:28:50.759 --> 00:28:54.279
I will let the entire martial world
taste what it means to wait for death.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:55.990
Wise as ever, Cult Master.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.480
But that inner power

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.119
was it truly passed on by you?

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.680
That was merely a tactic
to break his will.

00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:11.039
If the Sword Immortal's power

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:13.480
were unleashed without distraction,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.599
this battle

00:29:14.599 --> 00:29:15.720
might not end in our favor.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.200
Back.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:28.460
(Tianlong Cult)

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.200
Everyone,

00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:36.359
I have explained the situation.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.319
This concerns the survival of our sect

00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:39.559
and your very lives.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.519
I have no right to decide for you.

00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:43.279
If anyone wishes to leave,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.880
I will not stop you.

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:47.119
But if you choose to stay,

00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:49.400
then stand with me, Su Beilu,

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.440
and defend the Cangqiong Sect
to the end.

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:55.160
Staying here means death.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.880
I am sorry, Beilu.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.759
I...

00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:07.319
I am my family's only son.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.780
I have to leave the mountain.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.210
Senior Brother Zhang is going first.

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.119
We should go too.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.580
I still have an elderly mother at home.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:17.880
I am sorry.

00:30:20.079 --> 00:30:22.650
I will never forget the kindness shown
by the Sect Leader and you.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.599
Take care.

00:30:44.119 --> 00:30:44.839
Beilu...

00:30:44.839 --> 00:30:46.079
No need to say more.

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:49.640
These past days,

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.240
being with all of you,

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.160
I was truly happy.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.119
And it was worth it.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.599
Wanting to leave

00:30:58.039 --> 00:30:59.359
is only natural.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.440
I do not want you deciding
in the heat of the moment.

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:04.599
Go back first.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.759
Those who wish to stay,

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.359
in three days' time,

00:31:09.359 --> 00:31:10.400
gather in the courtyard.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.680
Beilu,

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:40.599
if others choose to leave,

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:41.960
I will not stop them.

00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:44.559
But I hope

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.039
you will stay.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.680
You,

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:50.920
me,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.440
Min.

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:55.640
We were the first
to enter Master's tutelage.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.599
The Cangqiong Sect

00:31:58.559 --> 00:31:59.680
is our home.

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.680
I hope you can stay with us

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.599
and hold the mountain gate.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.319
As I am now,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.359
my inner power is gone.

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:15.279
To be blunt, I am useless.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.759
If a useless man stays,

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:21.160
what difference does it make?

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:22.519
Who says you are useless?

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:24.119
Master once said,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.440
when everyone stands together,

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.480
even metal can be cut.

00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:32.240
I believe

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:34.559
that if we join forces,

00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:38.119
we can defeat Long Zhentian.

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:40.480
And even if we fail,

00:32:41.119 --> 00:32:42.839
at least we will have given everything.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.519
I am not like you.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.839
Ever since we were kids,

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240
you were tall and strong.

00:32:58.759 --> 00:32:59.920
Good at sports,

00:33:02.039 --> 00:33:03.400
all the boys in class

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.519
looked up to you.

00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:09.279
They all wanted to be you.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.640
But me?

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:16.599
I was bullied growing up.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.559
People around me mocked me,

00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:21.440
looked down on me,

00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:22.920
said I

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.920
was useless,

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:27.319
said I would never make it,

00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:31.880
said I was a mama's boy.

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:35.720
I thought that

00:33:35.839 --> 00:33:37.839
coming into this world
would finally let me

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.319
live it up for once,

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.119
be like you.

00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:45.400
But I never expected

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.519
that even here,
I am still the same person.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.519
Even when handed a perfect deck,

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.599
I still play it terribly.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.119
So saving the world

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.799
is better left to heroes like you.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.599
Someone like me,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.880
a scared, ordinary person,

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.159
what else can I really do?

00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:19.159
Just let me go.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.400
Oh, right.

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:29.119
The sect leader's seal

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:32.360
I left it on the table together
with the Alliance Leader's ring.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:34.199
Those two things

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.360
were never mine to begin with.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.610
Stop right there.

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:00.559
Brother,

00:36:00.639 --> 00:36:00.920
I...

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:01.320
I...

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.300
I do not have any money.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.400
Please do not kill me.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.440
Dressed this well,

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.719
who would believe you are broke?

00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:06.639
Search him.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.960
See? He does have something.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.000
Why are you carrying
a useless stone in your pouch?

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:17.400
I thought it was money.

00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:19.519
All that effort for nothing.

00:36:19.639 --> 00:36:20.360
Get lost.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:21.800
Get lost.

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:25.639
Bad luck.

00:36:57.719 --> 00:37:00.239
Let me out.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.199
So this stone

00:37:06.519 --> 00:37:08.360
is proof of the bond
between the three of us.

00:37:08.719 --> 00:37:10.360
No matter where I go,
I carry it with me.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.920
You take one piece.

00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:13.800
You take one piece.

00:37:15.719 --> 00:37:17.039
Put them together,

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.960
and with our combined strength,

00:37:20.639 --> 00:37:22.320
we can defeat Long Zhentian.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.119
Even if we fail,

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.880
we will have given it everything.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.280
Long Zhentian.
