00:20.145 --> 00:20.979
Min-suk!

00:22.897 --> 00:23.982
Don't come near me.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.242
BEST WISHES FOR YOUR WEDDING

00:38.872 --> 00:40.206
Jeez, what's going on?

00:40.290 --> 00:42.375
Gosh, what's happening?

00:55.805 --> 00:56.639
Min-suk!

01:07.817 --> 01:08.693
What?

01:09.486 --> 01:10.320
What the…

01:22.415 --> 01:23.583
My clothes…

01:33.802 --> 01:35.345
-You're awake.
-Damn!

01:35.845 --> 01:37.055
What the hell?

01:37.138 --> 01:38.139
Who are you?

01:42.435 --> 01:43.478
Nice to meet you.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.483
My name is Byeon Ho-in.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.903
BYEON HO-IN LAW OFFICE
BYEON HO-IN

01:51.986 --> 01:54.864
My name literally means "lawyer."
Imagine how confusing that gets in court.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.244
But I can't just change the name
my parents gave me, right?

02:00.745 --> 02:02.872
Just like the superpowers we have.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.144
Min-suk.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.353
DIVORCE ATTORNEY BYEON HO-IN

02:25.436 --> 02:27.856
-Hey, Sang-ung. Are you okay?
-I'm good. How about you?

02:27.939 --> 02:30.191
-I'm good too.
-Let's introduce ourselves.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.158
This is Bang Eun-mi.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.785
Her nickname is Bun-mi
because she loves bread.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.245
Stop that. It's annoying.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.830
Sorry. Anyway, Bun-mi

02:43.913 --> 02:47.041
can use telekinesis based
on how many calories she consumes.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.628
My superpowers kick in
when I drink alcohol.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.463
You saw it at the hotel, Min-suk?

03:05.143 --> 03:08.021
Well, so what?

03:08.104 --> 03:11.649
What I'm saying is, you're not the only
one with superpowers in this world.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.819
Feels a bit… less lonely, doesn't it?

03:17.906 --> 03:20.575
First-time visitors usually like it
up to this point.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.993
I don't like it.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.581
This universe keeps expanding.
Will I even be able to handle it later?

03:27.081 --> 03:29.667
We are the Society of Korean Superhumans.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.421
SUPERHUMANS SOCIETY
REPRESENTATIVE, BYEON HO-IN

03:33.504 --> 03:34.881
This sounds like a disaster.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.009
-Let's just go home.
-Let's go.

03:38.092 --> 03:40.803
We're an organization
that brings superhumans like you

03:40.887 --> 03:44.682
out of the shadows
to fight for the good of the world.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.850
Nice. Good for you.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.686
But I would like to stay in the shadows.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.606
-Thank you so much for helping us.
-Thank you.

03:52.732 --> 03:56.069
I'll make sure
to return these clothes to you soon.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.864
Who do you think set fire to your home?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.783
I forgot that my house is gone.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.621
-What is he saying?
-Min-suk.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.332
-Excuse me!
-Won't take long. Come see something.

04:36.067 --> 04:36.985
Oh my.

04:43.032 --> 04:43.866
Let's go inside.

BEOMHA'S FIRST GENE CLONING

05:19.986 --> 05:21.446
They're the Mundane Vanguard.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.532
"Beom" for "mundane"
and "in" for "person."

05:25.033 --> 05:27.285
Those mundane people gather
to hunt superhumans.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.371
What do you mean "hunt"?

05:31.831 --> 05:32.957
Why would they?

05:33.750 --> 05:34.709
They're jealous.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.128
We have what they can't have.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.469
They have everything
except superpowers and morals.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.596
THE JO FAMILY TREE

05:46.679 --> 05:49.390
From abilities, power, and money
to companies, land, and research labs,

05:49.474 --> 05:51.184
they've got everything.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.769
So they have many friends too.

05:52.852 --> 05:56.481
Congress, government agencies,
the legal system, corporations, the media,

05:56.564 --> 05:58.816
the police, organized crime…

06:00.318 --> 06:01.986
The whole world is on their side.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.004
So what?

06:21.923 --> 06:24.342
Unfortunately, their next target

06:25.635 --> 06:26.844
is you, Sang-ung.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.155
Father.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.702
I have found the bastard
who did this to you.

06:53.287 --> 06:56.416
I will be able to take his superpowers.

07:08.094 --> 07:14.058
VIP WARD

07:18.646 --> 07:20.273
You always said this, Father.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.776
"Hold on to the good things,

07:24.360 --> 07:26.112
and never give them to anyone."

07:37.707 --> 07:38.541
Yes?

07:41.627 --> 07:44.547
Everyone has come out.
Even the ones who'd been in hiding.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.133
Hurry.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.428
Things will get messy
once that lawyer gets involved.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.598
The thing is,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.267
it seems he's found the guy first.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.062
Incompetent fool.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.192
Don't make me step in.

08:08.905 --> 08:09.739
Damn it.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.661
I'm their target?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.663
Do they know who I am?

08:17.747 --> 08:19.040
Of course they do.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.375
That's why they showed up at your place.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.800
Should I go into hiding?

08:31.052 --> 08:33.596
Hiding only makes things easier for them.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.015
They attacked you in the open,
in broad daylight.

08:36.098 --> 08:40.269
You want to hide somewhere remote?
It's perfect for avoiding attention.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.146
Then what do I do?

08:43.981 --> 08:46.734
You can just act like you normally do.

08:46.817 --> 08:47.652
What?

08:49.529 --> 08:52.281
Their attacks begin
by disrupting our daily lives.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.159
Risk your life to protect it.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.411
At the same time,

08:57.495 --> 09:00.831
we must gather evidence of their actions
and see them punished by law.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.636
We'll help you get your life back
to the way it was.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.479
You may not realize it yet,

09:24.230 --> 09:25.606
but you're the only one

09:26.899 --> 09:28.317
who can stop them.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.329
I should go.

09:46.836 --> 09:47.753
Let's go.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.797
Why did you help those people?

09:52.174 --> 09:54.385
The bus crash
or what happened at the hotel…

09:59.015 --> 10:02.935
If you were in the same situation again,
would you make a different choice?

10:10.109 --> 10:11.902
The life you want to live,

10:13.529 --> 10:14.614
what does it look like?

10:42.308 --> 10:45.519
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
EMERGENCY RESCUE COMMAND POST

10:55.279 --> 10:57.323
Photos are done here. Let's clear it out.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.158
Check for any remaining evidence.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.079
But the cable runs this way,
so I think it should be fine.

11:03.829 --> 11:04.664
You're here.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.248
Yes, you're doing great work.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.377
All right.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.629
Send this line to forensics for analysis.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.130
-Gas explosion?
-Yes.

11:13.214 --> 11:17.051
A fire started near the east bridal room
and spread across the entire floor.

11:17.134 --> 11:20.846
Two years ago, the LPG supplier
was penalized for poor maintenance,

11:20.930 --> 11:24.809
and we've obtained statements from guests
who smelled gas just before the explosion.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.079
-And security cameras?
-They're all burned. We can't use them.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.249
We have a video from the scene…

11:49.083 --> 11:51.085
It's going viral online right now.

11:51.168 --> 11:54.213
-Cashero, who rescued the bus passengers--
-Wasn't it fake?

11:55.089 --> 11:57.550
Come on, look at the scale of this.
This can't be fake.

12:00.928 --> 12:04.056
Why isn't this person evacuating?

12:04.974 --> 12:05.808
I'm not sure.

12:06.934 --> 12:07.768
You're right.

12:09.478 --> 12:10.938
Let's find her and ask.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.281
Are you kidding?

12:21.073 --> 12:23.200
How is this training?
And I need to go to work.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.952
This is the best full-body workout.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.205
Excuse me.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.791
You seem a lot younger than me.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.960
Why talk to me
like I'm your little brother?

12:33.794 --> 12:34.628
How old are you?

12:35.713 --> 12:38.132
-"Old"?
-Didn’t you say I shouldn’t be rude?

12:40.468 --> 12:41.469
Just put that on.

12:49.894 --> 12:50.936
Water is the heaviest.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.273
-Jeez.
-Do you have a lot of money, mister?

12:54.356 --> 12:58.194
You wanna blow tens of thousands
every time you help someone and go broke?

13:04.033 --> 13:05.868
Let's work hard, mister!

13:07.077 --> 13:08.370
Hurry back.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.623
Since it's our first day,

13:10.706 --> 13:11.707
try to land one hit.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.542
Just one hit?

13:14.126 --> 13:16.170
Then I can go straight home?

13:20.341 --> 13:21.300
Too slow.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.040
Can I use money?

13:53.123 --> 13:54.792
Go ahead. It's your money anyway.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.286
For God's sake.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.999
You haven't hit me yet.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.626
I just wasted my money.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.337
What is this? I just blew 40,000 won.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.177
You can't rely solely on your superpowers.

14:47.261 --> 14:51.265
Use your own power most of the time.
Boost your efficiency at critical moments.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.182
Why?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.312
This is a capitalist society.

15:08.115 --> 15:08.949
Too slow!

15:09.033 --> 15:10.743
I'm not some kind of athlete.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.161
You got this!

15:32.806 --> 15:34.224
You're slow.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.625
Here and here!

16:07.174 --> 16:08.842
BEOMHA RANCH
NEEDS FURTHER INVESTIGATION

16:08.926 --> 16:10.928
This is a subsidiary
of the Mundane Vanguard.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.889
It may look
like an ordinary livestock company,

16:13.973 --> 16:16.183
but they attack
and experiment on superhumans.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.645
Our first goal is to destroy it
and extract their data.

16:20.938 --> 16:21.855
"Our"?

16:22.564 --> 16:24.650
-Does this include me?
-Of course.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.946
It's a classified area,
so the security is tight.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.531
Hundreds are guarding every path.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.449
-You'll have to get us through.
-Me?

16:35.744 --> 16:38.914
No? Let's switch roles, then.
You pass through a 30-cm-thick door…

16:39.623 --> 16:40.749
I'll take the guards.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.334
Then it's settled.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.130
I'm working on the most practical
and efficient plan,

16:46.213 --> 16:48.549
so you just keep training until then.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.678
It's a present.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.099
There was no need…

17:01.270 --> 17:03.897
Keep your money in that, not your pocket.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.816
Don't drop it all over the place.

17:07.526 --> 17:11.363
Even my girlfriend of nine years
never gave me underwear as a gift.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.077
And if your identity gets out,
we're all in trouble,

17:17.161 --> 17:19.538
so cover that face
out in the open as well.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.417
This is practically a criminal's outfit.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.216
Seeing the mask reminded me of someone.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.514
-How much do you have?
-Don't do this.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.933
Why are you even carrying a bag, bitch?

17:40.017 --> 17:40.976
Wait a minute…

17:41.060 --> 17:41.894
Hey!

17:43.270 --> 17:44.396
Shit, that startled me.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.565
-What the hell?
-Who are you?

17:48.942 --> 17:49.860
Me?

17:50.569 --> 17:51.737
Someone passing by.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.243
-Looking back…
-Passing by?

17:58.327 --> 18:00.412
…I've always been a passerby.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.207
When I saw the Salvation Army's kettle

18:03.290 --> 18:06.710
or a kind man being beaten up by thugs,

18:06.794 --> 18:09.379
I was the one who just passed by.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.007
Then just keep on passing by.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.133
I don't want to.

18:13.217 --> 18:17.012
You guys keep disrupting
the e-commerce order like this,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.680
and I can't stand it anymore.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.490
We should take that.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.492
You got the money?

18:41.161 --> 18:43.163
10,000 won is enough for you guys.

18:52.339 --> 18:53.882
Fuck! Damn it!

18:57.386 --> 18:58.470
You son of a bitch!

19:03.142 --> 19:04.059
You damn bastard!

19:06.937 --> 19:07.896
Damn it.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.232
Fuck! You bastard!

19:16.280 --> 19:17.197
He packs a punch.

19:21.118 --> 19:21.952
Let's go.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.183
Honey.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.060
Didn't you say you sold this?

19:53.567 --> 19:54.985
-There. Jump!
-There you go!

19:55.068 --> 19:56.153
-Wow!
-Well done!

19:56.236 --> 19:57.738
That's my boy!

19:57.821 --> 19:59.907
There we go. Look!

20:32.606 --> 20:33.774
Someone passing by.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.072
Just someone.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.281
Someone.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.742
Just someone passing by.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.131
Someone passing by.

20:58.632 --> 21:02.511
I will no longer let it slide.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.308
Tell me you didn't go out like that.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.442
It's for privacy concerns.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.493
Jeez, it's freaking embarrassing,

21:26.576 --> 21:29.288
so don't ever walk around
the neighborhood like that.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.373
That training thing.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.917
Do it at least five stations away
from here, okay?

21:34.876 --> 21:35.711
You're letting me?

21:39.214 --> 21:40.966
It's coming out of your allowance.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.635
You said it's cheaper
than going to a dermatologist.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.471
I'll think of it as a donation.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.390
But whatever you do,

21:49.057 --> 21:53.478
never, ever touch the savings.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.272
I don't even have that much money.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.734
By the way,

21:59.735 --> 22:00.861
why all of a sudden?

22:09.036 --> 22:10.078
I got picked.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.834
HOUSING LOTTERY RESULTS
KIM MIN-SUK

22:16.418 --> 22:17.294
Holy crap!

22:17.377 --> 22:19.129
Seriously, that's amazing!

22:19.212 --> 22:21.381
Wow! When did this happen?

22:21.465 --> 22:24.009
While you were out saving the world
with that mask on.

22:24.092 --> 22:25.469
That's incredible. It's crazy.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.137
Newlywed housing?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.266
Wait a minute.
Did we actually get married?

22:31.850 --> 22:33.226
You stamped the marriage form.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.187
You seemed busy, so I handled it alone.

22:37.397 --> 22:38.231
Osan?

22:39.107 --> 22:41.735
Hey, Osan is basically part
of the Seoul metro area.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.029
Right.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.074
-Sang-ung.
-Yes?

22:47.157 --> 22:49.868
-We really need to start saving properly.
-Okay.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.912
We need 60 million won right now.

22:51.995 --> 22:56.041
If I drain my savings account
and borrow the rest from my parents,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.251
the down payment's covered.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.962
What about the second payment
and the balance?

23:02.839 --> 23:06.009
There's a place offering double my salary.
Got an interview tomorrow.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.388
Hey, you're amazing.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.305
Seriously!

23:10.847 --> 23:11.848
Wait.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.267
What now?

23:15.352 --> 23:16.770
Your allowance for this month.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.898
-Thank you very much.
-Sure.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.778
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30…

23:26.446 --> 23:27.531
50,000 won?

23:28.281 --> 23:29.574
There's an extra 50,000 won.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.119
300,000 won is for your training.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.413
As for the 50,000 won,
I need to check something.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.081
Check what?

23:38.333 --> 23:40.168
-About that superpower.
-Yes?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.421
The more money you have,
the stronger you get?

23:42.504 --> 23:43.380
Yes.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.383
Then your whole body gets stronger?

23:46.466 --> 23:48.677
Every single part?

23:49.386 --> 23:50.220
I guess so.

23:53.014 --> 23:57.144
Then how much can you do with 50,000 won?

23:57.227 --> 23:58.061
Do what?

24:12.451 --> 24:13.452
Right.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.166
I'm not sure. But…

24:20.667 --> 24:23.795
I think we need to check that.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.046
Check?

24:53.158 --> 24:56.161
You've gotten into such great shape.

24:56.244 --> 24:57.913
I can lift 32 water bottles at once.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.597
Quick. Hurry up and use it.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.224
You're gonna be shocked.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.562
-What happened to you?
-What?

25:22.646 --> 25:25.899
-When did you get this strong?
-Come on, I'm Kang Sang-ung!

25:27.901 --> 25:29.694
-Where is Mr. Gi?
-He's in treatment.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.364
For fuck's sake,
what kind of treatment takes so long?

26:20.745 --> 26:23.415
He's injured,
so his body might not be able to take it.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.793
These days, qualifications alone
aren't enough to make a living.

26:28.461 --> 26:32.966
Isn't it better for him to at least try
than to die doing nothing?

26:34.801 --> 26:37.262
Think of this as a supplement

26:38.179 --> 26:39.431
and give him the shot.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.392
No?

26:43.476 --> 26:45.270
Then you get the shot.

27:17.010 --> 27:20.096
So where are we going right now?

27:21.181 --> 27:22.557
To catch bad guys.

27:41.284 --> 27:42.577
Okay, let's unload them all.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.580
Wait, you mean these?

27:46.915 --> 27:49.042
We'll start delivering from up there.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.504
We're not catching bad guys?

27:53.588 --> 27:56.007
Cold is the worst enemy of the poor.

27:58.051 --> 27:58.885
Right.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.443
Too hard? Use your powers.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.571
I don't have the money for it.
You go ahead.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.970
Sir, I'm here.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.763
Come on in.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.103
Hey, Bun-mi.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.480
Where are we?

28:52.564 --> 28:53.857
Old Man Do's house.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.233
Who is Old Man Do?

28:55.316 --> 28:57.444
A superhuman who's a really old man.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.864
What is his superpower?

29:01.698 --> 29:04.284
He's the most powerful superhuman
among us.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.581
He can see the future.

29:13.042 --> 29:15.044
He will let you know if you're ready.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.379
Come inside.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.521
THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD. I SHALL NOT WANT
PSALM 23:1

29:45.033 --> 29:47.243
-So you're Dong-gi's son?
-Yes.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.954
-You must be broke.
-Pardon?

29:52.499 --> 29:53.583
Yes.

29:53.666 --> 29:56.252
I may live in a place like this,
but I'm rich.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.839
-I see.
-So did Samsung Electronics hit 100,000?

30:00.715 --> 30:01.549
The stock?

30:02.550 --> 30:07.263
No, I think it stopped
at around 60,000 won.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.473
Goddamn it.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.101
I should've sold it at 80,000 won.

30:13.728 --> 30:17.774
I'm here because I heard
you'd tell me if I was ready.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.027
Yes, that's right.

30:22.904 --> 30:26.491
Let me see.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.213
What now?

30:45.552 --> 30:47.637
Fuck! I'm sorry.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.973
Gold that sinks into the darkness
loses its shine,

30:51.391 --> 30:54.727
and the power of the mighty
vanishes into nothingness.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.523
Wait, I'm not quite following…

31:00.817 --> 31:02.944
Yet when you throw yourself in
for their sake,

31:03.027 --> 31:05.071
as one would toss a coin into a well,

31:05.613 --> 31:09.701
then the gold regains its brilliance.

31:13.371 --> 31:14.998
What is he even saying?

31:25.550 --> 31:26.801
Sir?

31:28.303 --> 31:30.305
Sir! Are you…

31:37.604 --> 31:39.188
So you're Dong-gi's son?

31:42.317 --> 31:43.151
Yes, I am.

31:45.778 --> 31:47.196
You must be broke.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.160
Yes.

31:57.206 --> 31:58.499
What did he say?

32:00.710 --> 32:01.711
Nothing much.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.715
I think he's just a little off.

32:05.798 --> 32:08.217
His eyes suddenly turned
all white and stuff.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.135
Right.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.888
I'm sure he only said what was needed.

32:13.097 --> 32:16.476
The more he looks ahead,
the more he forgets the past.

32:19.270 --> 32:20.563
We're all like that.

32:21.689 --> 32:24.108
Money, health, precious memories.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.236
But it can't be helped.

32:30.531 --> 32:31.491
Bun-mi.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.121
Come here.

32:38.706 --> 32:39.832
Why?

33:07.652 --> 33:08.653
Thank you, sir.

33:09.988 --> 33:10.822
Formal speech?

33:11.656 --> 33:12.490
Cut it out.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.202
It's them.

33:24.961 --> 33:25.795
DOSANG CONSTRUCTION

33:25.878 --> 33:28.297
-Get out now!
-All right. Everyone, move!

33:28.381 --> 33:29.549
Hey, get them already!

33:29.632 --> 33:31.050
Target is up there!

33:56.951 --> 33:59.620
Bun-mi. Take Old Man Do somewhere safe.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.375
Sang-ung.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.293
Yes.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.921
-Here.
-Okay.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.131
Run away.

34:10.757 --> 34:11.716
What?

34:11.799 --> 34:14.552
You must not get caught.
There's a retaining wall that way.

34:14.635 --> 34:17.513
-That money should be enough to clear it.
-What? What about you?

34:18.514 --> 34:20.266
It's an alley. I'll block them.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.061
-But--
-Just hurry up and go.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.730
Hey, run quickly!

34:51.047 --> 34:52.340
No one can get past me!

34:52.423 --> 34:53.508
Hey, push through!

35:10.566 --> 35:11.734
Seriously!

35:29.919 --> 35:32.797
CHAIRWOMAN PARK JEONG-JA

35:32.880 --> 35:33.798
What?

35:35.383 --> 35:36.843
You want something from me?

35:38.678 --> 35:41.013
What kind of crap is this?

35:41.097 --> 35:44.809
Following my dad around,
trying to marry me off to your daughter…

35:45.935 --> 35:47.854
You just have something you want me to do.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.648
You don't really care
about being paid back.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.654
Stop talking nonsense
and just pay me back.

35:56.737 --> 35:57.905
I'll do it.

36:03.911 --> 36:05.371
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

36:08.666 --> 36:11.127
Whatever it is?

36:11.210 --> 36:12.044
But in return…

36:15.798 --> 36:17.300
could you lend me some money?

36:23.306 --> 36:26.267
People only call when they're desperate.

36:28.936 --> 36:29.937
I'm sorry.

36:30.646 --> 36:32.690
My future son-in-law just called.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.694
That's all right.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.071
Your name is Kim Min-suk?

36:39.780 --> 36:40.615
Yes.

36:41.490 --> 36:42.950
Nice to meet you.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.097
-Sir, are you all right?
-I'm okay.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.433
-Bun-mi, what about you?
-Yes, I'm fine.

38:01.070 --> 38:04.699
You thought you'd be safer
walking around in broad daylight?

38:06.117 --> 38:07.660
You're all here.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.412
Had some kind of team dinner?

38:09.495 --> 38:11.414
I should've done this sooner.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.501
So, where is Kang Sang-ung?

38:17.503 --> 38:20.965
I've been waiting all this time
just to see your damn face.

38:25.344 --> 38:27.680
I need to see the face myself

38:28.556 --> 38:30.349
in order to see that person's future.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.226
What?

39:02.882 --> 39:05.051
He will return soon.

39:05.551 --> 39:08.095
You'll be cast out of your own home.

39:09.638 --> 39:12.391
Your death isn't far off.

39:15.561 --> 39:19.148
The bullet you fired
will come back to you…

39:50.179 --> 39:53.140
I think I need a larger sized
pair of underwear.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.018
Look. The money won't all go in.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.484
Sang-ung.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.778
-Mister.
-I told you not to call me that.

40:06.946 --> 40:07.863
Sir.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.032
Kang Sang-ung.

40:10.991 --> 40:12.368
Were you looking for me?

40:28.884 --> 40:30.219
It's not just money.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.597
It's an illegal loan
from a third-rate lender

40:33.681 --> 40:35.224
with the highest interest rate.

40:36.684 --> 40:37.685
One late payment,

40:38.269 --> 40:41.397
and there's no future for me.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.110
Mister!

41:51.383 --> 41:52.885
The spending never ends.

41:54.428 --> 41:56.514
My paycheck hardly lasts in my account.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.807
From family events to utility bills,

41:59.391 --> 42:01.519
they never stop coming.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.107
Just like them.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.552
RECHARGE YOUR CALORIES!

42:34.635 --> 42:35.678
Damn it.

42:56.615 --> 42:57.700
Don't come near me!

43:22.099 --> 43:23.058
For fuck's sake.

44:09.188 --> 44:11.690
You're out of money, aren't you?
You broke-ass loser.

44:21.950 --> 44:25.037
You must've worked out a lot.
You're in better shape.

44:36.423 --> 44:37.591
That punk…

44:59.613 --> 45:01.073
My goodness.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.062
If I get close, I'll get burned.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.231
If I back off, I'll get hit.

45:39.778 --> 45:40.779
What do I do?

49:19.706 --> 49:24.711
