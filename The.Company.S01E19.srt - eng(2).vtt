(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.460
(Rain Manor)

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.780
(Rain Manor)

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.220
Why haven't I seen you before?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.840
Where's Mr. Li?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.960
Mr. Li is my uncle.

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.159
He was unwell.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.390
He has returned to his hometown.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.120
You guys may call me Ning.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:28.400
I'm new to the place.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:29.879
(Ning)
I kindly ask for your understanding

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.159
(Ning)
if our hospitality falls short.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.479
Now that you're here,

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.719
you've given

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.879
the old manor

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.759
something worth looking forward to.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.560
Everyone,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.520
please come with me.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.879
Please.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.759
Chi.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:49.479
Let's go.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.170
It's been a long time
since I last came here.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.520
Godfather, long time no see.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.790
Happy Double Ninth Festival.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.180
Elder Yu, happy Double Ninth Festival.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.800
Yu.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.360
Happy Double Ninth Festival.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.560
Happy Double Ninth Festival.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.590
Happy Double Ninth Festival.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.560
All of you are here.

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.080
Please put down your gifts.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.039
Elder Yu.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.759
Happy Double Ninth Festival.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.720
It's been 30 years.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.600
Why do you still look

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.480
as young as always?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.839
Elder Yu, I think

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.600
you were referring to my father.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.820
Everyone said
that I resembled him to a tee.

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:46.920
You do.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.360
You resemble him so much.

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:53.160
Why isn't your father here?

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:54.600
Is...

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.120
Is he sick?

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.000
He has already passed away.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.759
I see.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.040
This young man is my friend.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:05.879
He's Su Beilu.

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:10.560
Godfather.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:12.400
I've been married for a few years.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.260
But I haven't introduced
my husband to you yet.

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.000
This is my husband, Wei Zhuoran.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.839
He's a doctor.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.439
Elder Yu.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.839
He seems like he practices
Western medicine.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.120
I came back after
completing my studies abroad

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.079
so that I could promote
Western medicine.

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.360
You abandon the profound knowledge
of traditional Chinese medicine

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.120
and went abroad

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.000
just to learn
all that superficial knowledge.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.519
I don't know what you're thinking.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.399
Yu,

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.279
your minor is gigantic.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.190
Why didn't you hire a few more servants?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.839
Now, I'm a decrepit old man.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.399
I no longer have any desires.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.639
I'm just

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:02.639
counting my days here.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:08.560
Sir,

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.519
as per the rules,
the first thing we should do

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:13.480
is to take our guests
to your collection gallery.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Indeed. Elder Yu, your collection gallery
is renowned throughout the world.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.639
It's been so long
since we had visited the place.

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.920
Listen, back then, this place
was filled with visitors and guests.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.680
There were so many people.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.079
It was...

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:24.360
It was so lively.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.839
Ning,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.360
if so,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.879
you may take our guests

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.639
to the collection gallery.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.600
Yes, sir.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.920
Everyone, please follow me.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:35.680
Scrappy.

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:36.959
(Scrappy)
Serve our master well.

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:37.680
Yes, ma'am.

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.639
Please.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:59.199
I heard that Elder Yu
was upright and honest.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.879
But now, there are
plenty of security guards here.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.790
This doesn't seem like
something he'll do.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.360
Elder Yu's lifetime collection
is all stored here.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.120
It can be considered a museum.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:09.120
Naturally,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.560
we require more security guards here.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.319
All of you may leave.

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:14.990
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:21.839
What is this?

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.519
This is the
Coiled Dragon Bronze Tripod Cauldron.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.690
It's something
he's collected over half a lifetime.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.720
He only brought it out in recent years.

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:32.600
Miss Ning, you're truly an expert.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.270
Although you're new to the place,

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:37.439
you know about Elder Yu's collection

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:38.520
like the back of your hand.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.399
I never expected such a treasure
to appear in a private collection.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.160
We're so lucky.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.000
My horizons have truly been broadened.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.199
Please feel free to explore on your own.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.279
Grand in spirit,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.040
with forceful and vigorous strokes.

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:13.150
The suspended-needle verticals

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:14.759
fall like sharpened blades,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.160
the power piercing through the paper.

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:19.879
Within inches of space,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.040
I can see flashes of steel and
clashing swords.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.519
Excellent.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.450
Speaking of flashes of steel
and clashing swords,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.639
Brother, why do you not like
the Slender Gold script?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.470
At the turning points,
the tip is alternately concealed

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.860
and revealed, the movement
flows with controlled pauses and presses.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.759
Though extremely slender,
the strokes do not lose their substance,

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.350
and thus possess a beauty of their own.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.679
Regrettably, Huizong's weakness

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.000
led the nation astray.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.180
He lacked true capability.

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:42.240
His force is ultimately empty.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.720
He's not worth any serious regard.

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:49.840
You're right.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:51.519
Brother,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.320
you're right about everything.

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:57.080
You're the toughest
in the entire Hong family.

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:59.870
You're good at martial arts,
and you have a refined taste.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.639
The things you don't like
have no value at all.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:05.639
Why are you being sarcastic here?

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:11.440
You despise someone for being useless,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.440
yet you want that useless person
to make you money.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.600
In the end, it only
tarnished your reputation

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.860
and caused you to lose your rent.

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:19.120
You said you wanted
to buy a piece of land

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.200
to start a woman's swimming class.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.790
In the end, I was the one
who borrowed money on your behalf.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.799
You take all of the credit.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.679
But when there are hardships to endure,
you'll make sure I get half of them.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.039
What do you know?

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.890
You'd better mind your own business.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.240
Miss Wu,

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.279
I don't think we've seen this before.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:48.159
Yeah.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.200
There weren't this many exhibits
the last time we came here.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.240
We can always see

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.480
interesting items
whenever we visit here.

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:55.559
This is great.

00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:59.000
Last time we came,
you didn't know a single thing.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:01.520
I've been catching up on work
for the past few years, you know?

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:07.879
I'm truly honored
that you guys are here to visit me

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.159
during Double Ninth Festival.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.840
Admiring autumn chrysanthemums,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.080
wearing sprigs of dogwood,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.360
savoring fine delicacies,

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:15.559
and sipping fragrant tea.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.879
All of these are crucial.

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:21.600
This chrysanthemum liquor smells great.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.990
It's brewed by the local winery
below the mountains.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.039
I thought

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.519
you brewed it yourself.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.500
Wearing sprigs of dogwood
during Double Ninth Festival, huh?

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:33.000
This is quite interesting.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.000
What's your name?

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.480
My name is Chongyang.

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:37.519
But,

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.399
they call me Scrappy.

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:41.120
Scrappy?

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.519
Is it because you're mischievous?

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:44.639
Scrappy,

00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:47.879
head to the room, bring out
the gifts that they brought for Master,

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:48.919
and show them to him.

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.320
Thank you, Elder Yu.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.700
Thank you for allowing us
to gather at this very place.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.200
Let's offer Elder Yu a toast.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.240
Elder Yu,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.600
I wish you eternal happiness
and longevity!

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.840
- Happy Double Ninth Festival.
- Happy Double Ninth Festival.

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:05.879
Thank you.

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:06.960
Likewise.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.559
I know nothing else.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.360
Let me sing a song for Godfather.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.400
Allow me to entertain you all
with a song of mine.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.679
Sure.

♪You and I are both figures

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.559
Excellent!

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.039
Excellent!

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.390
Although it's been
some years since we met,

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:30.840
Yunong, you still have a heavenly voice.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.120
And, your singing has improved a lot.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.620
You have a bright future ahead.

00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:36.080
Godfather, you flatter me.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:43.120
Don't you feel like
something's off about the manor?

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.440
But I can't quite put my finger on why.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.660
(Rain Manor)

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.399
It seems like you guys haven't
enjoyed yourselves enough.

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:03.720
I've also prepared a program as well.

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:06.440
I hope to share
this enjoyment with you all.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.919
Isn't that the Liubo Chess set
that we're here to retrieve?

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:19.600
Dear nephew,

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:22.200
do you know how to play Liubo Chess?

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:23.279
Just a little bit.

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:24.559
Excellent.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.360
Since everyone is here,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.879
I wish

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:31.240
to play a round

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.039
of live-action Liubo Chess with you all.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.399
Live-action Liubo Chess?

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.559
This...

00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:40.440
How do we go about this?

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.960
My nephew and I will play a round.

00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:44.519
The rest of you will act as chess pieces

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:45.120
and

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.080
move according

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.399
to our actions in this courtyard.

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:49.720
Ning,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.399
please tell them the rules.

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:55.480
A Liubo Chess match
is divided into Black and White teams.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.919
The two teams set off
from opposite sides of the courtyard.

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:01.279
If two chess pieces
encounter each other,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.960
one of them will devour the other.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.170
No matter if you're on
the Black team or the White team,

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.020
the first person to reach
the center of the courtyard

00:14:08.039 --> 00:14:08.840
will be the winner.

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:11.440
But only two people will play the game.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.360
What about the chess pieces?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.879
Is our role just to walk around?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.600
It doesn't matter.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.559
I've come up

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:18.759
with a new rule.

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:21.799
If two chess pieces encounter each other,

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:23.000
I will

00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:25.519
give them a pouch.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.919
As for what's inside the pouch,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.960
please allow me
to keep you all in suspense for now.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.000
You guys will know

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.519
by then.

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:37.639
He's being so secretive.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.559
Since it's a game of chess,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.690
there will surely be
a winner and a loser.

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:50.120
It's still better
to offer a reward to the winner.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.039
I've decided.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.090
No matter if you're on
the Black team or the White team,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.000
as long as one side wins,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.559
everyone

00:14:58.919 --> 00:14:59.960
will receive

00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:01.679
10,000 silver dollars.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.840
That's a huge reward.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.080
That much?

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.120
I...

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:07.799
Is that a lot of money?

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:09.120
I'm already nearing the end of my life.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.380
I was plagued by a long illness.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.039
To me,

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:13.679
money no longer matters.

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:15.360
Besides,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.480
I don't have a descendant as well.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.159
It's pointless

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.720
to keep this money all to myself.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.720
If so,

00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:28.120
since we're chess pieces,

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:30.200
how can we know
how many steps we should take?

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:31.639
The players will toss

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.650
bamboo chopsticks
to determine the number of steps.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.879
After that, I'll notify
you all to move accordingly.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.799
If I knock on the black bronze bowl,
the Black team will move.

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:41.559
If I beat the white drum,
the White team will move.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.240
I'll do it twice.

00:15:43.919 --> 00:15:45.279
The first time

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:46.600
will be your sequence number.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.960
The second time will be
the number of steps you will take.

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.679
The candles on the floor

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:53.320
will be your guide.

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:55.840
Five candles represent one step.

00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:58.200
If so, how will we
divide ourselves into teams?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.090
And, how should we arrange
our sequence?

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.980
(Four)

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.220
(One)

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.559
Those who received a black card,
please stand here.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.600
Those who received a white card,
please stand there.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.360
Elder Yu, thank you for the effort.

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:41.080
Now that the order is all jumbled up,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.879
no matter which side wins the match,

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:45.100
at least one person in the team
will receive the award.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.000
Thank you, Elder Yu.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.000
You're truly generous indeed.

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:54.799
If so, please write down your name

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.759
on the chess pieces.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.920
With a red brush?

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.000
It seems quite inauspicious.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.480
This game isn't as fun as you think.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.839
I won't be around later.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.550
You'd better keep your wits about you.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.550
It's likely that this game
might affect our minds.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.359
I think the White team lacks one member.

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:34.559
I...

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.480
I want to give it a try as well.

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:38.160
May I?

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.160
You may.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.240
But

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.799
you don't need to write down your name.

00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:44.559
Mr. Su,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.599
Miss Wu,

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:46.720
Second Master Hong,

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.119
and Mr. Pan,

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.720
you guys belong to the Black team.
Please follow me.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.680
As for the White team,

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.160
please follow Scrappy.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.200
Remember,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.319
you must listen to my command.

00:17:58.759 --> 00:18:00.720
Do not take the wrong number of steps.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.880
Go now.

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:06.920
Go now.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.020
(Rain Manor)

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.260
(Black Team Zone)

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.720
So, these candles

00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:29.759
were arranged based on
the point positions in Liubo Chess.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.920
If so, the layout of this courtyard...

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.759
It was built

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.599
to imitate the Liubo Chess board we saw.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.290
Mr. Pan, you have excellent perception.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.799
Rain Manor is huge.

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:55.260
And, you only get to
spend time with Elder Yu every day.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.200
Aren't you bored?

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:00.960
Miss Ning,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.640
you may find me anytime
if you wish to take a walk

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:04.799
in the city.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.620
(Pan Yunzhe)

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.930
Second Master Hong.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.480
You were already listless
when I saw you.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.799
What happened?

00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:24.960
What's on your mind?

00:19:26.119 --> 00:19:27.200
What did you say just now?

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:29.519
I said, you should pull yourself together.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:30.920
You'd better not drag us down.

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:33.950
I'll hold you accountable
if we fail to receive the reward.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.039
Fine.

00:19:40.759 --> 00:19:41.599
That Yu,

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:44.160
(White Team Zone)
he's still acting on a whim at this age.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.079
Live-action Liubo Chess?

00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:48.400
He just wants us

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.079
to play house with him.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.390
We'll receive a huge reward
just for playing house with him.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.150
Let's just treat it
as an attempt to entertain him.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.630
Yeah. I'm sure it's been tough
on him as well.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.880
After all, he's all alone.

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.319
Unlike you, Master Pan.

00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:01.640
You have a happy family.

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:05.240
Master Pan.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.960
May we speak in private?

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.680
Master Pan.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.640
You are the elder

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.880
I trust the most.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.400
Rumors

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:20.079
have been circulating lately.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.990
People were saying that Hong Martial
Arts Center would go out of business.

00:20:23.119 --> 00:20:23.920
I wonder

00:20:24.279 --> 00:20:26.039
if you've heard of
such ridiculous rumors.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.240
I have not.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:29.920
I'm glad to hear that.

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:31.960
All those accounts

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:34.640
are documented in black and white.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.200
Our revenues remain stable.

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:38.000
You don't need to worry at all.

00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:39.039
As for

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:40.000
all those rumors,

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.759
I'm sure our rival
spread them on purpose.

00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:46.200
They wanted you to fall for their trick
and withdraw your investment.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.850
I'm glad to hear that.

00:20:50.079 --> 00:20:50.880
Master Pan,

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:52.160
as for

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.440
the woman's swimming class...

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.799
I'll think about it.

00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:56.319
Okay.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.279
Dr. Wei, I almost forgot about you.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.519
I heard that your clinic

00:21:14.519 --> 00:21:16.519
wasn't doing as well as you expected.

00:21:18.519 --> 00:21:20.000
When it comes to Western medicine,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.079
one has to either
go through surgery or bleed.

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.759
It sounds scary.

00:21:24.079 --> 00:21:25.240
It must've been stressful

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.200
to maintain your clinic.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.519
I'm sure it's been tough on you two.

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:31.799
You see,

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:33.640
I'm a medical doctor who studied abroad.

00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:36.850
Master Hong, I don't need your concern
when it comes to medical skills.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.279
I think you should put in more effort

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.300
into maintaining
your martial arts center instead.

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:52.480
The new Western mindset
is truly remarkable.

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:54.359
They advocate gender equality.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.319
It doesn't matter

00:21:57.319 --> 00:21:58.759
who's the breadwinner.

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:04.920
Dear nephew,

00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:08.839
speaking of your father,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.359
we merely
had a buyer-seller relationship.

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:14.680
We weren't even friends.

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:16.640
One day,

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:19.440
we traveled far and wide

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.240
to a remote village
just to check out an antique item.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.640
But it poured for three days

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.240
all of a sudden.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.400
But luckily,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.559
I was a chess fanatic.

00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:31.039
I would bring a chess set with me
no matter where I went.

00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:35.279
We passed our days playing chess.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.240
It didn't feel like

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.440
the wait was long at all.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.120
"When shall we trim the candle
by the western window together,

00:22:42.519 --> 00:22:44.400
and speak again
of the night rain in Bashan?

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.640
A human life lasts
but a few short decades".

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.300
Those moments were rare indeed.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.319
Elder Yu,

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.680
to be honest,

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.200
this Liubo Chess set

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.680
is very important to me.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.440
If I do win

00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:07.000
the match,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.839
may I have

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.960
the chess set?

00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:16.880
Fine.

00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:19.160
On account of my ties with your father

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.759
as chess partners and bosom friends,

00:23:22.599 --> 00:23:23.640
if you do win the match,

00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:25.920
you may have the chess set.

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:27.079
Thank you, Elder Yu.

00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:27.920
However,

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.160
according to the rules,

00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:31.519
once the game has begun,

00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:34.119
it cannot be stopped

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:36.200
until one side wins.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.559
That's a given.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.480
Elder Yu,

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.759
everything is ready.

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:58.759
Let's begin.

00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:00.599
You're our guest.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.559
You may go first.

00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:04.720
All right.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.640
Hong Lie

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.200
will take three steps.

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.720
White Chess No. 2 will take three steps.

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:36.720
The white drum was
beaten twice at first.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.720
That represents Mr. Hong Lie.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.000
It was beaten thrice the second time.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
That means you have to take three steps.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:43.880
All right.

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:46.680
Master Pan,

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.519
I'll go first.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.440
Black Chess No. 2 will take five steps.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.440
Everyone.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.319
I shall take my leave first.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:30.920
Take care.

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:39.880
Miss Wu.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.920
Are you troubled by something?

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:44.920
That's not it.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.039
I was just suddenly reminded of the fact

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.920
that this year's Double Ninth Festival

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.079
fell on the same day
as Xiuyun's birthday.

00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:01.839
Why did you bring her up?

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.519
Why can't I bring her up?

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.319
I'm sure all of us were
thinking of the same thing.

00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:08.900
It's just that no one said it out loud.

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:14.880
Wei Zhuoran will take two steps.

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:17.680
White Chess No. 1 will take two steps.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.079
Master Pan, I'll make a move first.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.079
All black?

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.519
This is a masterstroke.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.759
That means this chess piece can
devour every piece it passes through.

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:44.319
However, this is just a game.

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:45.799
I don't want it

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:47.359
to be too brutal.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.680
Therefore, I deleted that rule.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.519
If it's all-white,
it constitutes a draw.

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:54.119
That means both pieces will be fine.

00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:56.400
If not, they'll have to fight.

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:57.720
It's bad.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.160
It's bad indeed.

00:27:01.359 --> 00:27:03.359
Black Chess No. 2 will take six steps.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.599
You're moving Hong Chi again.

00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:09.680
Elder Yu, it seems like
you're bent on winning.

00:27:10.119 --> 00:27:12.519
The way you play this chess
is the same as your father.

00:27:13.079 --> 00:27:14.230
You have to pay more attention

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.180
so that you won't miss out
on excellent opportunities.

00:27:16.359 --> 00:27:17.740
Elder Yu, you should know this too.

00:27:18.359 --> 00:27:19.240
Haste

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.400
makes waste.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.240
If so, let the kid move first.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.359
Master Pan is the eldest member
among them.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.960
It's good for him to take a break.

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:34.440
White Chess No. 4 will take one step.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.160
I'll make sure your friend
gets to move as well.

00:27:48.079 --> 00:27:49.240
If not, he'll get bored.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.200
Regarding that matter,
I'll make a move first.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.039
We've already moved on from it.

00:27:58.039 --> 00:27:59.640
How can we move on
from her just like that?

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.200
What gives us the right to do so?

00:28:01.839 --> 00:28:03.559
Didn't we already make a promise?

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.000
You think you're one
of the good people now, huh?

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.759
Don't you know well enough
what you've done back then?

00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:12.240
How can you face Xiuyun like this?

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.839
Would Xiuyun have ended up like that

00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:17.440
had you not introduced her to Mr. Zhou,

00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:19.880
who already had a wife back then?

00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:23.279
One cup of hot tea.

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:27.400
Here's your tea.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.119
Thank you.

00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:30.220
(Zhou Mingxuan)

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.420
(Yu Xiuyun)

00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:01.160
How many times have I told you?

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.220
I wasn't the one who wanted
to introduce her to him.

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:04.880
Besides,

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:06.279
where were you back then?

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:08.359
You were all lovey-dovey

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.359
with your beloved Mr. Wei.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.039
Did you even have time to care for
your best friend, Xiuyun?

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:17.240
If only we had left a few days earlier.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.260
I'm sure it would end differently

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.060
had we left a few days earlier.

00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:23.890
A few days earlier?
I don't get what you mean.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.079
You were the one
who pulled the strings first.

00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:26.839
What do you mean by that?
Blame me for it?

00:29:26.839 --> 00:29:28.320
There's no way I can reason with you.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.160
This is the first battle.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.440
This will be interesting.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.799
Black Chess No. 3 will take three steps.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.240
Ning,

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.559
hurry and give them the pouch.

00:29:58.559 --> 00:29:59.640
I have a question,

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.119
Elder Yu.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.490
Why did you design

00:30:02.519 --> 00:30:03.960
this courtyard

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:06.119
to imitate the Liubo Chess board?

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:09.440
I don't think it was built recently.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.319
I suppose you must've spent a lot of time
maintaining it carefully.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.700
It's been many years since we last met,

00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:17.880
and now, you want us to play
live-action Liubo Chess with you.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.000
I suppose you didn't
just do it on a whim.

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:23.880
When I was young,

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:25.920
besides collecting antiques,

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.680
studying antiques,
and doing my business,

00:30:29.079 --> 00:30:31.279
my only hobby was playing chess.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.720
In the past,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.680
Xiuyun was there to play chess with me.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.720
But now,

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.680
I'm in my twilight years,

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.000
barely clinging to life.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.279
There's no one

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.839
to play chess with me.

00:30:46.519 --> 00:30:48.119
Therefore, I designed the courtyard

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.799
to make it imitate a Liubo Chess board.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.359
Usually,

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.160
I'll walk around in the courtyard

00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:56.920
and take a breather.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.200
As we age, we become
more sensitive to cold.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.000
Nephew,

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.359
please wait a moment.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.839
I'll get some thicker clothing.

00:31:36.759 --> 00:31:37.400
Brother?

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.759
We actually reached the same position.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.480
What should we do next?

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.039
I think we'll try to capture each other.

00:31:44.559 --> 00:31:47.200
The one who's captured
will leave the board and rest.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.519
What about the pouch?

00:31:50.839 --> 00:31:51.880
What's with that?

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.400
Guys.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.720
This is the pouch Master
had prepared for you two.

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:09.440
This is?

00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:18.720
This is Xiuyun's dagger.

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:21.920
What does Elder Yu mean by this?

00:32:23.839 --> 00:32:25.000
Master wants you two

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.680
to decide the winner yourselves.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.880
Of course,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.119
it doesn't have to be a fight.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.720
You guys just need to decide

00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:33.759
who will leave and who will stay.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.200
You may tell me
after you've made your decision.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.599
Guys,

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:38.960
take your time.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.400
You may leave first.

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:00.920
Next time, you'd better not
spout nonsense in front of Master Pan.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.559
Just now,

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:03.630
I already told him

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.890
that the revenues for our center
had returned to normal.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.480
I wasn't spouting nonsense.

00:33:11.359 --> 00:33:13.119
Brother, this is just a reminder.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.920
Right now, our students
aren't proficient in their training.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.690
If we send them to participate in
contests, they'll surely lose.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.759
If we expand our center in this state,

00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:22.759
it'll only ruin
the Hong family's reputation.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.119
By then, not only will we not be able
to take in new students,

00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:27.559
but we also won't be able
to pay the rent.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.150
You don't want
to expand our center, huh?

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.240
If so, where will we get the money
to hold the woman's swimming class?

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.820
It's precisely that we're going to
hold a woman's swimming class

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.039
that we can foresee the outcome.

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:44.279
Not many women will be willing
to join us at the start.

00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:45.920
But we need to maintain the pool.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.079
It'll take a lot of money

00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:49.000
and time.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.960
If you insist on expanding
the martial arts center,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.319
I'm afraid we'll end up
throwing away even our last penny.

00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:57.000
I don't understand at all.

00:33:57.319 --> 00:33:58.799
You know nothing about business.

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:00.079
Get out!

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.039
Get out!

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:09.920
All along,

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.880
I've only ever been your foil.

00:34:13.559 --> 00:34:15.679
You took my service
for granted long ago, didn't you?

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.440
I know that you're upset
when you saw Xiuyun's dagger.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.880
You fancied Xiuyun.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.280
But Xiuyun didn't fancy you at all.

00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:30.870
You don't have the right
to mention her name!

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.639
She wouldn't have met that Zhou fellow

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.800
had you not dragged her away from me

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.480
so that you could butter up to Master Pan!

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.270
Their relationship wouldn't
have existed in the first place!

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.640
Did you think I buttered up to
Master Pan for my own sake?

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.079
The truth is,
Xiuyun didn't fancy you at all.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.559
Is it that hard for you

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.880
to admit the truth?

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.880
Shut up!

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.159
You're hesitant.

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.580
You cannot achieve anything great!

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.000
You're incompetent!

00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:55.100
What makes you think
that Xiuyun will fall for you?

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:57.719
Did you actually hit me?

00:34:58.119 --> 00:34:59.159
So what?

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.559
Mister.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.440
Congratulations, mister.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.239
The winner has been decided.

00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:14.679
Your white chess piece

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.559
wasn't captured by
the black chess piece.

00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:18.119
The black chess piece

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.840
was captured.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.840
(Hong Chi)

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.559
The black chess piece?

00:36:26.559 --> 00:36:27.719
What happened?

00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:28.960
I need to take a look.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.280
I'm afraid not.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.280
Elder Yu specifically said

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.519
that the courtyard of Rain Manor
has a complex terrain.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.480
People who are not familiar
with the terrain

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.679
will lose their way.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.079
You should remain here
and finish the game.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.199
After that,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.880
you can have a tour.

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:45.679
What was inside
the pouch Elder Yu had prepared?

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:48.440
Nothing more than a few items

00:36:48.679 --> 00:36:51.760
to help everyone get more into the game.

00:36:52.559 --> 00:36:53.940
They add another layer of intrigue

00:36:54.159 --> 00:36:55.800
to the game.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.039
Playing chess is fun indeed.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.400
The fun lies in reading
your opponent's mindset.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.000
Sometimes, it can even reveal the
unfathomable depths of the human heart.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.519
At best, it magnifies
one's desire to win.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:09.920
At worst,

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.800
siblings might turn against each other.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.639
(This is bad.)

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.960
(It seems the Hong brothers
had already turned against each other.)

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.400
During Double Ninth Festival,

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:28.920
we ascend and gaze into the distance.

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:31.079
Little did anyone realize,

00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:32.840
the hardest part is

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.719
that among all
the dogwood sprigs, someone is absent.

00:37:37.719 --> 00:37:39.340
(Spirit Tablet of Yu Xiuyun)

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.239
"Among all the dogwood sprigs,
someone is absent"?

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.760
Elder Yu, what does that mean?

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.760
My nephew,

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.039
it took me some time
to find suitable clothing.

00:37:49.039 --> 00:37:50.039
Sorry about that.

00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:51.880
Let's continue.

00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:58.400
The black chess piece
was captured instead?

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.280
It's fine.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.159
It's fine.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.480
When two pieces meet, the later piece
always captures the earlier one.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.480
However, you use your pouch
to decide who captures whom.

00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:10.719
I heard someone fighting
in the courtyard just now.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.559
Shouldn't we pause the game
and check it out first?

00:38:13.559 --> 00:38:16.039
I already said this
when we started the match.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.000
The game cannot be stopped
until a winner has been determined.

00:38:20.159 --> 00:38:21.920
But what if it concerns
one's life and death?

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.760
Nephew,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.000
I only allowed you to come
on account of your father.

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:29.760
But if you come here

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.079
and change the rules I have
without any regard for me,

00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:34.199
you shouldn't blame the host

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.719
for being rude to his guests.

00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:41.719
But Elder Yu,

00:38:42.719 --> 00:38:44.519
what kind of host are you?

00:38:44.519 --> 00:38:45.800
I'm merely respecting

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:48.039
the sacred rules of the game.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.199
Dear nephew,

00:38:50.119 --> 00:38:50.679
please.

00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:10.039
White Chess No. 2 will take three steps.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.000
You want the White team
to win as soon as possible

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.440
so that you can end the game, huh?

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:22.719
But it's rare for me

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.960
to encounter a worthy rival like you.

00:39:26.639 --> 00:39:29.079
I can't bear for the game
to end this quickly.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.500
(Wu Yunong)

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.119
Move out of the way.

00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:51.000
It's my turn to move.

00:39:51.159 --> 00:39:52.039
Clarify yourself.

00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:55.660
What did you mean when you said I
procured and betrayed Xiuyun?

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.719
Listen up.

00:39:56.719 --> 00:39:58.440
Even if I were to starve to death,

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.519
I would never commit
such a despicable deed.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.599
Starve to death?

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.800
A noble person like you
would never face such a fate.

00:40:06.079 --> 00:40:07.390
Just look at your background.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.239
Even if you do squander
your entire fortune,

00:40:09.239 --> 00:40:10.960
you still have
that good father of yours.

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:13.199
Master Pan will clean up your mess for you,

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.599
young master.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.990
Whether my father helps me or not,
that's a different thing.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.719
But I won't make a woman do that.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.770
What do you mean by that?

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.920
Singer Wu,

00:40:27.039 --> 00:40:28.039
you're already married,

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.760
yet you're still
showing your face in public.

00:40:31.159 --> 00:40:33.400
If we put it nicely,
we call it returning to your career.

00:40:33.519 --> 00:40:35.000
But those who know better all know

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.990
that you're doing this to support
that pathetic excuse of a man named Wei.

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:40.119
Say that again if you dare.

00:40:41.079 --> 00:40:41.719
I said,

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.960
I merely felt sorry for you.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.000
I don't need it!

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.960
Although no one said it openly,

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.599
they were mocking you behind your back.

00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:54.440
Miss Wu,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.580
you'd better not treat yourself
as the main character here.

00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:11.840
Miss Wu?

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.559
This is interesting.

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:41.719
Black Chess No. 1 will take five steps.

00:41:48.679 --> 00:41:50.119
(I hope that couple)

00:41:50.599 --> 00:41:52.480
(is truly as loving as they appear.)

00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.599
Zhuoran?

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.159
Yunong.
