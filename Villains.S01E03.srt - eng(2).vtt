ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.375
Okay, let's hear it.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.086
How did you begin
making those supernotes?

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:54.429
EPISODE 3:
BAIT; THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CASE

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:57.974
4 MONTHS AGO

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.022
Look at this.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.611
Here you go.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.673
My goodness.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.759
Time catches up with everyone.

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:35.512
Most of the black-market
money changers in Namdaemun

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.138
are gone now.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.350
They're saying cash is
going to disappear soon.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:44.521
Now, there are only two artists left
who can make counterfeits

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.397
and export them overseas.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.901
There's another psycho doing this
besides me? Who?

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.028
Who else?

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.242
You really don't know?

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:00.578
Do you mean Yeon?

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.247
Yes.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.500
Since when did she start
exchanging money here?

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:08.336
It's been about six months.

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.715
That punk. I'm going to kill her.

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:17.053
Auntie, I'm here.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.602
Demand is down lately,
so the price dropped.

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:27.272
Let's do a 10% commission. Please?

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:30.984
Your mascara smudged.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.027
What are you talking about?
This is waterproof.

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.530
Your mascara smudged.

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:37.907
No, it didn't...

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.715
There's no way
you printed these yourself.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.383
Where did you get them?

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:00.263
Five years ago

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.515
I found them while sorting
through Dad's things.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.520
Why are you pushing them
onto the mainland?

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.315
- To get revenge.
- What?

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:14.527
I've been planning
to avenge my dad for five years.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.070
And I'm putting it into action now.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.072
How are you planning to get revenge?

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.157
Eight years ago

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.576
J approached you
because of the counterfeit bills

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.203
you spread in China.

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.371
I'm going to take advantage of it.

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:29.626
You think a guy who won't even bite
on Hong Kong dollars

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.003
will bite on Chinese yuan?

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:33.922
Hong Kong dollars?

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.382
Actually

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.385
I've been circulating
Hong Kong dollars in Macao

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.720
for the last year
for the same reason.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.306
But he's not taking the bait.

00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:51.356
I have an idea.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:52.857
What idea?

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.027
Yeon.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.197
I genuinely didn't want
to drag you into this world.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.283
But I need your skills
for the revised plan.

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.036
- My skills?
- You know

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:07.330
you were glued to the computer
back in middle school

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.957
and I used to chew you out for it.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.043
Hacking?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.420
That I'm confident about.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.133
But why were you
so hesitant to ask me?

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.593
Of course, we do it together.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.016
What's the plan?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.184
I've got a partner.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.440
Hey, I'm Fixer.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.733
Tracking, surveillance, tailing

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.194
digging into backgrounds,
gambling intel, mining, and trading.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.405
I don't care about the industry
or the deposit order

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:41.489
nor do I have work ethics.

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:43.616
I simply work off the amount.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.827
Which means if a client pays more

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.413
I'm ready to stab the client,
who pays less

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.915
from behind at all times.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.792
So you're a scumbag.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.133
You're a total psychopath.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:04.095
His nickname is "King of Bullshit,"
so he's not exactly trustworthy

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:05.805
but I picked him because

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.559
he's been doing business
with J for ten years.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:12.729
He knows J better than anyone.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:15.148
I admire your wise choice, client.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.608
Anyway, J has been

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:21.529
off his main job of crime design
for over two years

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.531
laundering and managing secret funds

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:26.534
for rich people around the world
through Bitcoin.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.329
I casually asked him

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.997
and he said he hasn't quit
his main lane.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.416
He's also tracking trends
in digital currency markets...

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.336
I don't care why J is doing it.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.380
What I care about is
that Jang Joong-hyuk

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.300
is on his multinational client list.

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:43.384
What?

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:46.971
Not all that rich-people money
that he's handling?

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:51.100
Why would you choose a notorious,
foul-tempered psycho cop?

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.894
What happened to Mr. Yang

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.355
and the stolen 30 million dollars.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.315
J and Joong-hyuk were
behind all of it.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.444
You plan to set
the two villains on each other.

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:02.653
Is that it?

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.364
That would be fun to watch.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.657
Show him, Yeon.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:10.453
Is it time to show you what I can do?

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.838
I hacked the server
storing his private keys.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:25.218
How about I open
Joong-hyuk's crypto wallet now?

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:43.569
What's wrong? It's not working?

00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:46.656
See? No matter how good she is

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.200
hacking Bitcoin is way beyond her.

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:56.749
I did it.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:57.875
For real?

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.254
That's my girl.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.843
After my hero Yu Gwan-sun,
I respect you the most.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.473
You cleaned out
all of Joong-hyuk's crypto, right?

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.518
How much are we talking?

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:16.602
Thirty billion won.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.357
I erased all of it, though.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.612
Why?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.449
This is about Mr. Yang's revenge.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.076
We won't allow
even a fingernail's worth of greed.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:36.122
If you didn't want it,
you could have given it to me!

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.587
INCOMING CALL

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:44.964
Is this J?

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.299
How did you know?

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:48.009
You sound
like you were waiting for me.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:53.181
I always miss you, think about you,
and want to hear your voice.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.224
Of course,
I was waiting for your call.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.767
I need you in Macao.

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:00.480
If you call, I come.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.441
Just book my flight,
and I'll fly out immediately.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.488
Our meeting time was 30 minutes ago.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:09.947
Why aren't you here yet?

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.949
J is finally starting to move.

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:14.452
I'm turning the car around
and heading to the airport now.

00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:15.912
I'll call you after I see him.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.375
Why? Is it about J?

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.420
He took our bait.

00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:33.221
MACAO

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:35.890
Okay.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.392
I'll go for it. We go big or go home.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.186
Player. Let's go.

00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:42.104
Come on.

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:46.359
Wait.

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:51.614
Let's see.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.408
Three. What do I need?

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.746
Let's go.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:00.873
Here it comes.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.209
The flight to Incheon is taking off!

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:06.045
Five! That's not bad.

00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:07.838
It's not bad.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.215
Great.

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:10.591
Come to Papa.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:13.219
Come...

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:15.596
I'm doomed.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.392
Damn it.

00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:22.186
Shit.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.314
Looks like I'm walking
all the way to Incheon Airport.

00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:27.608
Come...

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.652
Idiot.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.696
Who the hell is it?

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:32.780
It's me, you punk.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:35.575
Hey, Boss.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.544
But

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.629
you live a flashy life.

00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:52.091
Why do you carry cash like this?
It's kind of pathetic.

00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:53.384
You don't want it? Give it back.

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:54.927
Man, you're cold.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.429
You're like a New Yorker.

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:57.805
Seriously.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.604
That's counterfeit.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.022
What?

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.108
No way.
I've got a great nose for money.

00:10:13.654 --> 00:10:14.655
This has to be real.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.619
Chinese sailors dumped them in Macao.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.541
Are you saying
this was made in Korea?

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:29.629
Only one person in Korea
can produce such quality bills.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:32.423
Who?

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:36.344
My secret server, where I manage
my clients' hidden funds

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:37.803
was recently hacked.

00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:41.766
Out of all that easy money
from those rich guys

00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:43.142
they ignored everything

00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:46.020
and pinpointed
just one person's money.

00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:54.153
Your business philosophy is

00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:57.323
that you stab the guy
who pays less from behind

00:10:57.573 --> 00:10:59.450
if a new client pays more, right?

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.747
Why are we suddenly talking
about my philosophy?

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.207
Tell me the truth

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.793
and I'll pay you ten times more

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:10.878
than your current client.

00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:13.422
Ten times?

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.678
- What's the retainer?
- One billion won.

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:19.762
One billion?

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:23.808
Client.

00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:26.977
If you have dinner plans tonight

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.396
you might want to cancel.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:32.441
I've got a lot to brief you on.

00:11:35.277 --> 00:11:38.656
Soo-hyun, your bait worked so well
that he wanted to come to Korea

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:40.908
only one day after we met.

00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:43.744
Everything moved so fast

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.497
that I couldn't even call
and just flew in.

00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:50.084
Yes, Boss. I'll be right there.

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.378
I should hang up.

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:53.838
I'll call you back.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.886
May only good things
happen to you, Boss.

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:19.321
- Fuck you!
- Die!

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.281
See the guy in white?

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.325
He runs a fried chicken place.

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:06.535
And the one in khaki.

00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:07.828
He's the delivery guy.

00:13:08.662 --> 00:13:11.540
They worked together for three years

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.834
and now they're doing that crap here.

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:17.171
And see that old lady over there?

00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:18.339
The one who passed out.

00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:19.840
That's the owner's wife.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.258
She's a total junkie.

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:28.015
How much are you paying them

00:13:28.557 --> 00:13:30.518
that they're fighting
as if their lives depend on it?

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:33.020
This is an exhibition match.

00:13:33.103 --> 00:13:34.563
I'm not exactly paying them.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.107
The winner's interest gets waived.

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:39.860
Depending on how hard they fight,
I shave down the principal too.

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:42.071
The owner

00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:43.739
owes me 230 million won.

00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:47.618
The delivery guy owes me
120 million won.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:52.206
And they haven't paid interest
for months. Morons.

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:56.877
Watch those regular people
backed into a corner

00:13:57.127 --> 00:14:00.923
for messing with my money.
It's a survival bloodbath.

00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:05.344
It's nice, isn't it?

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:07.888
It's provocative.
Perfect for the reality show era.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:11.600
Just booze and food aren't enough
to compete anymore

00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:15.521
so you put debtor fights on stage

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.940
to pull in more customers?

00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:22.361
You're using people
at the edge of a cliff.

00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:24.196
You're something else.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.630
Well done.

00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:51.015
What to do now?

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.810
My goodness.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.022
What should I do?

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:01.609
- About what?
- Can you fight?

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:05.738
You want to fight them,
spill some blood

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.364
and pay me back?

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:11.368
How about it?

00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:28.719
So you summoned me
from Macao to ask me that?

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.561
Darn you.

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:42.066
You switched industries

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:44.985
about two years ago, right?

00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:48.280
That's impressive.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.032
In only two years

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.118
you became the best in the industry.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.497
Seriously. That's huge.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:58.666
Did you ever

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.085
mess up over there?

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:04.088
No, right?

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:07.007
Did you ever make those people

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.468
lose money?

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.764
No.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.477
Why did it have to be me?

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:20.354
Why?

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:25.943
Why am I the one taking the loss,
you piece of shit!

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.195
That's my question for you.

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:32.950
A mistake?

00:16:33.283 --> 00:16:34.785
Sure, mistakes happen.

00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:36.203
A couple of times... No.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:40.082
You can screw up dozens of times,
and I won't care.

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.001
But the one thing

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:46.755
I don't tolerate is losing my money!

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.173
It was 30 billion won!

00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:01.562
Come here.

00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:03.439
Come.

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:10.738
I'll wipe your principal clean.

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:12.614
How about another game?

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:13.741
Yes, sir.

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:27.755
Mr. Choi, step into the ring.

00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:32.217
Look at that.

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:38.974
What are you trying to do now?

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.810
What's it like being lumped together
with those people?

00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:45.022
Embarrassing, isn't it?

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.275
Before you get humiliated even more

00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:50.402
make up for the money

00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.655
that you lost. Understood?

00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:03.707
Come on.

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:09.838
All this trashy circus
over a measly 30 billion won?

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.716
Chief Jang Joong-hyuk.

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:17.012
Are you broke,
or have you got no pride?

00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:18.972
This is so pathetic.

00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:23.143
Let's

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.063
try to keep it classy.

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:27.356
Hey!

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:28.899
What did you just say?

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:33.028
"Classy"? This motherfucker.
Are you out of your mind?

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.988
Who do you think you are?

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:36.240
What a jerk.

00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:37.449
Hey.

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:39.910
Crazy bastard.

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:43.205
I ought to just...

00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:45.999
Maybe you can say

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.544
that it's a measly 30 billion won

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:51.755
because all your clients are
billionaires from all over the world

00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.549
but my 30 billion?

00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:57.427
I earned that by doing
disgusting shit, risking my life.

00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:00.013
That's everything I have,
you bastard.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:01.181
You get that?

00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:09.773
The world is vast

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:13.110
and there's plenty of money to skim.

00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:16.280
If you use your brain, that is.

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.783
Take a look at it and decide

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.744
whether to kill me or play me.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.462
We split the profit 6-4.

00:19:33.088 --> 00:19:35.299
You get six, and I take four.

00:19:35.382 --> 00:19:39.136
I'm adding interest
to the 30 billion I lost.

00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:46.226
I was so bored
that I was about to get depressed

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.603
but just a quick look tells me

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.146
this is going to be a thrill.

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:50.731
Do you seriously think
you can pull it off?

00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:58.447
I'm sure you've heard the rumors
that I've never failed once

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.825
as an architect.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.121
A business proposal like this is
infused with imagination.

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:13.629
Bring me a video pitch for this plan.

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.756
I'll decide after I see it.

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:19.801
You're incredibly picky.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.846
Fine. Better safe than sorry.

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:30.479
So J got Joong-hyuk involved again,
just like five years ago.

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:33.440
He would have gone looking for you,
the technician.

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:38.820
What did he say to get you
to make supernotes?

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.531
What was the distribution plan?

00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:46.870
What?

00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:50.999
Why did you suddenly get quiet again?

00:20:57.798 --> 00:20:59.508
I barely survived.

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:03.220
I'm exhausted,
so give me a few hours of sleep.

00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:13.605
The world isn't going to end
if we wait a few hours.

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:14.815
Let's get some rest first.

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:21.154
You heard her, right?

00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:25.367
You all heard Soo-hyun, right?

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.370
- Jeez.
- Find the exact location

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:29.830
of that illegal fight arena.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.082
I want to see it with my own eyes.

00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:47.139
Again, you're acting
without consulting me.

00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:49.016
Report to me first!

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.727
Then you get to order the team.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.853
Understood?

00:21:52.936 --> 00:21:54.980
Can we keep things simple?

00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:57.566
Don't tell me

00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.776
you actually believe her.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.778
That's why I'm going to confirm it.

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:04.573
To the illegal fight arena
that she mentioned.

00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:07.909
Try using your brain once in a while.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:10.120
I wouldn't be going
if I believed her.

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:22.591
They open twice a week

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.384
and there's a fight tonight.

00:22:24.468 --> 00:22:26.678
- It's been open for over five years.
- What?

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.264
It says hundreds of millions of won
move in bets in a single day.

00:22:30.474 --> 00:22:33.060
You're telling me
the local precinct never once busted

00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:34.436
such a massive illegal gambling ring?

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.021
Hey.

00:22:36.813 --> 00:22:38.482
We're 30 minutes out.

00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:40.359
Get Incheon Major Crimes moving.

00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:43.028
- Step on it.
- Yes.

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:28.782
Give me some more.

00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:30.992
Yes, give him.

00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:40.669
These scumbags. Get them out.

00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:42.504
Hey, wake up.

00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:44.005
- Hey.
- Snap out of it.

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.507
- Move, you bastard.
- Hey.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.467
- Kid.
- Jeez.

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:52.639
Seriously.

00:23:52.722 --> 00:23:53.932
- All right!
- Cash me out.

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:09.114
Go home, you bastard.

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.950
You scumbag.

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:13.285
Get lost.

00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:29.569
This fucker.

00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:30.654
YEOM CHEOL-JU

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.822
What?

00:25:33.073 --> 00:25:34.491
You already blew
through all the money?

00:25:34.824 --> 00:25:35.825
The NIS has made its move.

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:37.953
Incheon's Major Crimes Unit is
on its way to raid us.

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:40.622
INCHEON JUNG-GU POLICE STATION
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT, YEOM CHEOL-JU

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:41.706
The NIS?

00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:44.960
All right.

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:48.004
The NIS?
What kind of bad luck is this?

00:25:48.755 --> 00:25:49.756
BIG BOSS

00:26:14.197 --> 00:26:15.991
- Come here.
- Idiot.

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:17.075
Dumbass.

00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:18.743
Get over here.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.085
Bitch.

00:26:28.878 --> 00:26:30.422
Hey!

00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:33.216
Darn it.

00:26:33.883 --> 00:26:35.969
I haven't even won back
what I lost yet.

00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:40.682
Detective Yeom.

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.770
What took you so long?
I've been waiting forever!

00:26:46.062 --> 00:26:47.439
You came alone?

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:50.859
I got the call while I was on duty.

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:53.737
We also got an urgent call
while we were asleep.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.821
We're barely awake right now.

00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:56.656
Hurry up!

00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:00.910
Open your eyes. Wake up.

00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:02.579
Let's move.

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:06.291
Police!

00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:07.542
What?

00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:10.295
- Get in. Hurry.
- What's going on?

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.011
It's the police!

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:20.639
Freeze!

00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:29.564
Attention.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.150
Shit. Do not move!

00:27:33.693 --> 00:27:35.403
We're the police, okay?

00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:38.365
- Quiet!
- Who do you think you are?

00:27:38.448 --> 00:27:41.201
Put your hands on your head
and sit down.

00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:42.661
Sit, you fuck!

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.205
We've got nothing to lose!

00:27:45.288 --> 00:27:46.915
Let's smash everything and get out!

00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:50.251
Hold on.

00:27:54.422 --> 00:27:55.465
Push!

00:28:02.722 --> 00:28:04.557
Please pick up.

00:28:07.477 --> 00:28:08.645
Why aren't you answering...

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:11.398
What the fuck?

00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:26.037
Oh, shit.

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:34.754
Boss!

00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:54.983
This bitch is mine.

00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:59.904
If you take her, I'll slit her throat

00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:02.198
and kill you too.

00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:04.200
You punk!

00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:09.539
I'm from Busan.

00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:11.040
Are you from Busan too?

00:29:11.124 --> 00:29:13.042
Where have I seen you?

00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:14.544
What neighborhood are you from?

00:29:14.627 --> 00:29:17.130
Saha-gu? Suyeong-gu?

00:29:17.213 --> 00:29:19.132
- Yeongdo?
- Quit your bullshit.

00:29:19.466 --> 00:29:21.009
I told you not to come close.

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:23.136
You bastard.

00:29:23.636 --> 00:29:24.721
If you're going to get high

00:29:24.804 --> 00:29:26.389
spend some money
and take the expensive stuff.

00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:28.683
Shut your mouth, you fucking bitch.

00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:32.020
No one can take her from me.

00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:34.481
She's mine.

00:29:41.863 --> 00:29:44.407
Fine. Fuck it. She's all yours.

00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:45.784
I don't want her either.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.911
Go on. Take her.

00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:50.580
Take her, you fuck!

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.791
Are you okay? You're bleeding.

00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:54.250
Darn it.

00:29:55.418 --> 00:29:56.586
Man, that burns.

00:30:01.382 --> 00:30:02.383
Let go.

00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:05.011
Put the knife away.

00:30:06.429 --> 00:30:09.098
This motherfucker.

00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:11.351
You know what my family motto is?

00:30:11.851 --> 00:30:13.436
It's "watch your back."

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.604
"Always watch your back."

00:30:14.687 --> 00:30:16.773
I know I never listened to my father

00:30:16.856 --> 00:30:18.983
but do you really think

00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:20.735
I'd ever turn my back

00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:22.612
on trash like you?

00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:24.989
That really stings.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.410
Man, this bastard.

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:32.372
Have you lost your mind?

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:41.840
Move.

00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:46.636
What are you doing?

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:49.222
How should I...

00:30:49.305 --> 00:30:50.390
Boss.

00:30:50.807 --> 00:30:52.141
You're not going to shoot, are you?

00:31:00.984 --> 00:31:01.985
What's this?

00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:04.737
All right. Move out!

00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:19.794
Shit.

00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:23.798
What happened?

00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:30.555
Fuck.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.940
Where should I shoot
so it really hurts?

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:43.359
Boss.

00:31:43.443 --> 00:31:46.070
- This is going to get messy.
- Let go!

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:47.572
You.

00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:49.574
Unless you want a hole in your head

00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:51.868
shut your mouth and stay still.

00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:02.921
You pick. Left ankle

00:32:04.213 --> 00:32:05.715
or right ankle.

00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:08.509
Which one do you need less?

00:32:10.136 --> 00:32:12.138
- Please spare me.
- I'll count to three.

00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:14.474
- Three.
- Stop.

00:32:14.557 --> 00:32:16.225
Stop, you son of a bitch!

00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:18.853
- Two.
- Please forgive me.

00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:21.814
I'll do whatever you tell me.

00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:24.525
- One.
- Left.

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:25.610
Left foot!

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:30.156
Consider yourself lucky.

00:32:33.534 --> 00:32:34.535
Aren't you grateful?

00:32:36.537 --> 00:32:37.789
Thank you, sir.

00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:40.625
- Thank you so much.
- You express gratitude

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:44.212
through actions, not words,
you bastard.

00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:51.094
What is this, your living room?

00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:53.554
This idiot.

00:32:55.556 --> 00:32:58.685
This is going to be a problem.

00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:06.985
Look at yourselves.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.695
Anybody hurt?

00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:10.655
We were called out all of a sudden

00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:12.365
so our men weren't
in perfect condition.

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:14.742
How impressive.

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:17.036
Oh, jeez.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.622
Find out exactly who owns this place.

00:33:19.706 --> 00:33:21.958
- Yes, sir.
- Pull every surveillance feed.

00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:24.836
Track down the gamblers who ran,
the fighters who fought

00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:27.130
and every staffer involved.
Investigate every single person.

00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:29.465
That's under
the local precinct's jurisdiction.

00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:31.259
You'll need to talk to him.

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.552
Detective Yeom.

00:33:38.224 --> 00:33:39.267
How did you know to come here?

00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:45.023
I'm asking how you knew.

00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:47.608
We got a call at our precinct.

00:33:47.942 --> 00:33:49.777
From who? From us?

00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:51.529
But we never called.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.204
Are you suspecting me or something?

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:01.539
I came because I got a call.

00:34:01.622 --> 00:34:02.999
I'm only telling the truth.

00:34:03.082 --> 00:34:04.876
What's with that look?

00:34:04.959 --> 00:34:06.919
Why are you treating me
like I'm a criminal?

00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:10.131
Someone else at the NIS
must have called to tip us off.

00:34:10.923 --> 00:34:12.383
That never happened.

00:34:14.635 --> 00:34:15.803
Come on.

00:34:16.345 --> 00:34:19.474
You don't have to get that mad,
you know.

00:34:20.516 --> 00:34:22.769
It's not that important.
Let's just move on.

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:25.688
This won't work.
We'll check the footage ourselves.

00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:26.773
Yes, sir.

00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:29.442
We'll send our agents
to Jung-gu Police Station tomorrow

00:34:29.525 --> 00:34:30.943
so secure all the footage.

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:32.945
But you're all busy.

00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:35.031
We'll review it at our station.

00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:36.991
No, we'll do it ourselves.

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.743
All right.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.163
It's time to go home

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:44.832
Go home, wash your feet,
and go to bed.

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:46.042
Let's wrap up.

00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:47.960
Everybody, head home.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.219
Why are you still standing here?

00:34:58.012 --> 00:34:59.347
Oh, right.

00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:03.768
I'm screwed.

00:35:08.356 --> 00:35:10.900
Jang Joong-hyuk has been in
Jung-gu Police Station the longest.

00:35:11.317 --> 00:35:13.027
Judging from
how that detective was trembling

00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.695
this place is definitely
Joong-hyuk's operation.

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:17.198
And Soo-hyun's statement
about J teaming up with him

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:18.699
sounds more credible now.

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.244
Search again
and see if anything else turns up.

00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:23.412
Would you look at that.

00:35:27.583 --> 00:35:28.584
Jeez.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.171
What are you doing that for?

00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:34.257
I didn't do it.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.217
What matters isn't who caused

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.678
this fucked-up situation.

00:35:39.053 --> 00:35:41.013
What matters is

00:35:41.097 --> 00:35:43.975
how I get out of it.

00:35:44.058 --> 00:35:45.059
Fine.

00:35:45.726 --> 00:35:46.769
You didn't do it.

00:35:47.353 --> 00:35:50.690
That girl?
Let's say your friend killed her.

00:35:50.773 --> 00:35:53.442
You two came in here
to steal booze, okay?

00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:57.572
And I wasn't here
with that girl from the start.

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.867
You have to testify to that. Got it?

00:36:02.535 --> 00:36:04.453
Fucking bastard.

00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:14.255
Shut it. You're too loud.

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:17.216
I can't focus
with you being this loud.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.801
Stay still.

00:36:18.885 --> 00:36:20.011
Damn it.

00:36:20.469 --> 00:36:21.470
Now...

00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:28.394
Joong-ki, bring the drugs.
Bring whatever's left.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.191
Bring it.

00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:36.777
- Look at me.
- Yes.

00:36:40.823 --> 00:36:41.824
Here, take it.

00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:44.452
Here.

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:47.872
Drink some water.

00:36:53.502 --> 00:36:54.587
Hey.

00:36:55.087 --> 00:36:56.464
Did it hurt a lot?

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:57.882
This will make you feel better.

00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:00.176
Open your mouth.

00:37:00.259 --> 00:37:01.802
Open it. It's okay.

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:03.054
Open.

00:37:03.763 --> 00:37:04.889
Take it.

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:09.685
Swallow.

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:21.572
How is it?

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.243
Better?

00:37:25.534 --> 00:37:27.662
It hurts less, right?

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:46.615
Aren't you thankful
you're the only one still alive?

00:38:48.117 --> 00:38:51.704
Don't thank God for that.

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:53.414
Thank me.

00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:56.709
And keep that gratitude

00:38:57.626 --> 00:38:58.711
in your heart

00:38:59.378 --> 00:39:02.340
while you spend
the rest of your life in prison.

00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:04.550
If you even think
about crawling back out

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.594
you'll end up dead like him.

00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:07.928
Okay?

00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:09.513
Good.

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:37.708
Boss, here's your phone.

00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:43.381
Clean this place up

00:39:45.174 --> 00:39:46.300
then call the cops.

00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:48.052
Oh, right.

00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:51.347
The NIS raided our gambling joint.
Those sons of bitches.

00:39:51.931 --> 00:39:53.015
When?

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:54.725
Just now. Those bastards.

00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:55.935
Why are you telling me now?

00:39:57.019 --> 00:39:59.313
You useless piece of shit.

00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:00.398
Damn it.

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:16.747
Freeze!

00:41:39.205 --> 00:41:42.208
