00:59.593 --> 01:01.623
<i>Showtime!</i>

01:15.433 --> 01:17.109
All right, this one?

01:18.076 --> 01:20.137
-Come on!
-So close!

01:22.917 --> 01:24.941
Oh, cool!

01:29.522 --> 01:31.046
Hey.

01:33.089 --> 01:34.786
Thank you, honey.

01:48.572 --> 01:51.542
You seriously just gonna sit
here till the trapdoors open?

01:51.578 --> 01:52.801
Leave her alone.

01:52.836 --> 01:54.511
She does this every time
she's here.

01:54.546 --> 01:56.214
Come on.

02:01.982 --> 02:04.981
You look like someone
who could use a Freddy Fazcola.

02:09.523 --> 02:12.296
Ew. Tastes like gasoline.

02:15.001 --> 02:16.928
It doesn't come out for a while.

02:16.963 --> 02:20.133
Why don't you come back to
the table and hang out with us?

02:20.168 --> 02:21.968
They don't want me there.

02:22.003 --> 02:23.469
No one does.

02:23.504 --> 02:25.402
You just got
a bad roll of the dice.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.970
Things will get better.

02:29.774 --> 02:32.941
She's the only one
I can rely on.

02:32.976 --> 02:35.819
She's the only one
who's always here for me.

02:35.854 --> 02:38.850
That... thing down there

02:38.885 --> 02:43.222
isn't your spirit parent
or whatever you think it is.

02:43.257 --> 02:45.294
And it'll still be there

02:45.329 --> 02:47.296
even if you go have
a piece of cake first.

-Go tell your parents.

03:21.967 --> 03:22.998
Please, there's something wrong.

03:23.033 --> 03:24.995
Go tell your parents!

03:27.701 --> 03:29.301
Sir, please.
There's somebody who needs help.

03:29.337 --> 03:30.432
-Not right now.
-Please.

03:30.468 --> 03:31.501
Not right now.

03:31.536 --> 03:33.575
Will anybody help me?

03:34.641 --> 03:36.148
There's a little boy
who needs help.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.944
-Please help me.
-I'm sorry. Adults are talking.

03:37.980 --> 03:39.141
Run along.

03:41.578 --> 03:44.256
Charlotte! Don't.

08:50.159 --> 08:51.427
Hello?

08:51.463 --> 08:52.621
Hey, it's me.

08:52.656 --> 08:53.931
Mike.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.495
What time is it?

08:55.531 --> 08:57.829
Oh, uh, it's early. Sorry.

08:57.865 --> 08:59.830
-Did I... did I wake you up?
-No.

08:59.865 --> 09:03.404
I mean, yes, you did, but, uh...

09:03.439 --> 09:06.110
<i>I had a rough night.</i>

09:06.145 --> 09:07.906
Bad dreams again or...?

09:07.941 --> 09:10.742
-I can't seem to catch a break.
-Mm.

09:10.778 --> 09:12.279
Anything that I can do to help?

09:12.315 --> 09:13.546
No, I'm fine.

09:13.581 --> 09:14.876
How is your day going?

09:14.912 --> 09:16.787
Abby off to school?

09:16.823 --> 09:20.215
Uh, not yet. She's, uh...
she's around here somewhere.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.017
Jeremiah's on his way over
to help me

09:22.052 --> 09:23.819
keep painting the new house.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.220
-Great.
-Um...

09:25.255 --> 09:26.662
I just wanted to see
if we were...

09:26.697 --> 09:28.565
we're still good for...
for dinner later.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.726
Yeah. Yeah.

09:30.761 --> 09:32.136
Definitely.

09:32.171 --> 09:33.803
It'll be good to get out.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.199
Um, hey, I got to run,

09:36.234 --> 09:37.669
but I'll, uh...
I'll see you later, then.

09:37.704 --> 09:40.009
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

09:45.108 --> 09:46.707
So, have you kissed her yet?

09:46.743 --> 09:48.386
No.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.879
Abs, it's not...
it's not like that.

09:49.914 --> 09:51.652
We're-we're just friends.

09:51.688 --> 09:54.383
Then why are you going
on a date?

09:54.418 --> 09:57.127
-It's not a date.
-Then why can't I come along?

09:57.162 --> 09:58.920
Because you can't.

10:00.257 --> 10:02.594
That's what I thought.

10:02.629 --> 10:04.102
Abby!

10:04.137 --> 10:05.796
The Abbittyville Horror.

10:05.831 --> 10:07.700
The Abbster. Word up.

10:09.235 --> 10:10.900
What's happening?
You're growing like a weed.

10:10.936 --> 10:12.400
Uh, I got to run.

10:12.435 --> 10:13.904
You sure you don't want
to stay and paint?

10:13.939 --> 10:15.011
I'll trade places with you.

10:16.472 --> 10:18.446
Thanks, but I think
they'd notice at school.

10:18.482 --> 10:20.285
-Probably.
-Bye.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.385
-See you later.
-Bryson!

10:22.421 --> 10:25.115
Bryson, wait. You dropped this.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.891
You know, she's a good kid.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.693
She is.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.761
She's got a really good heart.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.130
So, you still going on
that date with Vanessa later?

10:34.364 --> 10:35.529
It's not a date.

10:35.564 --> 10:37.225
Just a couple of adults

10:37.261 --> 10:38.828
having dinner together,
you know?

10:38.863 --> 10:40.430
Mm.

10:42.468 --> 10:45.708
Listen, I wish you two
all the happiness in the world.

10:45.744 --> 10:50.242
All I'm saying is
she's got crazy eyes, Mike.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.751
She's not crazy, okay?

10:55.485 --> 10:57.486
Ooh, speaking of crazy.

10:57.521 --> 10:59.150
Ever since your aunt went around

10:59.185 --> 11:01.426
telling stories
about killer teddy bears,

11:01.461 --> 11:03.419
the whole damn town's
lost its mind.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.296
You know, I'll be happy
when this weekend's over,

11:05.331 --> 11:06.895
all the festival stuff's done

11:06.930 --> 11:08.831
and people maybe just
will go back to normal.

11:08.867 --> 11:12.330
Yeah. People are obsessed
with that old pizzeria.

11:12.365 --> 11:14.566
Yeah, I heard they had
your aunt committed, by the way.

11:14.602 --> 11:16.169
That's terrible.

11:17.133 --> 11:18.809
Yeah, it's a real shame.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.739
Hey, you sure your aunt
just made those stories up,

11:20.774 --> 11:22.745
like, out of the blue?

11:22.780 --> 11:24.607
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we just

11:24.643 --> 11:26.747
keep it between you and me that
Abby's even related to her?

11:26.783 --> 11:28.278
You know,
she's been through a lot,

11:28.314 --> 11:30.580
and she doesn't like
that kind of attention.

11:30.615 --> 11:33.085
So then Chica tried to shove me
into a springlock suit.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.020
But then Mike came in,
and he had a Taser,

11:35.055 --> 11:36.854
and he shot her
in the face with it.

11:36.889 --> 11:38.753
I ran for the dining room

11:38.789 --> 11:41.232
just as Foxy came off the stage
and started chasing me down.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.394
Luckily, Vanessa saved me.

11:43.429 --> 11:47.336
But then the Yellow Rabbit came,
and he attacked us.

11:47.371 --> 11:48.634
He got Vanessa.

11:48.669 --> 11:50.372
He stabbed her.

11:50.407 --> 11:51.773
She's okay now.

11:51.809 --> 11:53.974
So, what happened
to the Yellow Rabbit?

11:54.010 --> 11:56.445
The springlocks went off
inside of his own suit

11:56.480 --> 11:57.980
and crushed him alive.

11:59.212 --> 12:01.510
They say his body's
still at Freddy's,

12:01.545 --> 12:05.155
hidden in a secret room
that nobody's ever seen.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.418
You're crazy.

12:08.922 --> 12:11.026
Want to sit with us at lunch?

12:12.262 --> 12:14.194
Sure.

12:15.225 --> 12:16.992
Are you ever gonna go back?

12:17.028 --> 12:19.632
To Freddy's, I mean.

12:19.667 --> 12:22.667
I would, but...

12:22.703 --> 12:24.573
my friends...

12:24.608 --> 12:26.237
the animatronics are broken.

12:26.273 --> 12:30.207
Mike says that
he'll fix them someday, but...

12:30.242 --> 12:32.850
he's been saying that
for a while now.

12:34.612 --> 12:37.249
Wait, so do you actually
believe anything I'm saying?

12:37.284 --> 12:39.257
'Cause I'm pretty sure
everyone else just thinks

12:39.292 --> 12:40.792
I'm making this stuff up.

12:41.788 --> 12:43.886
I believe in UFOs.

12:43.921 --> 12:45.594
And ghosts.

12:45.629 --> 12:49.227
So why not haunted animatronics?

12:49.262 --> 12:50.731
Young ladies,
young men, let's go.

12:50.767 --> 12:52.402
Yeah.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.939
Everyone, eyes to me.

13:00.974 --> 13:04.739
I just want to, uh, remind you

13:04.774 --> 13:07.713
that our robotics presentation
at the science fair

13:07.748 --> 13:10.421
is this Saturday.

13:10.456 --> 13:14.152
Some of you have been swept up

13:14.188 --> 13:17.925
in the stupidity that is
this Freddy Fest.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.564
Actually, Mr. Berg,
it's Fazfest.

13:21.599 --> 13:23.396
I don't care what it's called.

13:23.431 --> 13:27.396
It's a mockery of everything
that true robotics stands for.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.034
We're making real robots here,
people.

13:30.069 --> 13:32.137
I want each and every one of you

13:32.173 --> 13:34.236
to be at that science fair
on Saturday,

13:34.272 --> 13:36.943
whether you're entering or not.

13:36.979 --> 13:40.075
Or you can expect
a big, fat "F."

13:40.110 --> 13:42.585
"F" for "Fazfest"?

13:42.620 --> 13:44.222
No.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.582
"F" for "fail."

13:47.217 --> 13:48.787
Don't waste your time.

13:48.822 --> 13:50.455
Let's get to work.

13:58.801 --> 14:00.595
Miss Schmidt.

14:00.631 --> 14:05.105
According to this,
you're planning on showing

14:05.141 --> 14:08.679
whatever this is
Saturday at the science fair.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.440
Certainly,
I don't have to remind you

14:10.475 --> 14:14.015
how important this event is
to the school.

14:14.051 --> 14:16.481
We're defending
a three-year winning streak.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.248
I'll be ready.

14:19.284 --> 14:21.591
Yeah, th-that's just the thing.

14:21.626 --> 14:23.719
I don't think you will be ready.

14:24.720 --> 14:29.164
Miss Schmidt,
robotics isn't for everyone.

14:30.097 --> 14:32.095
There's no shame
in taking a seat

14:32.130 --> 14:34.169
for the good of the team.

14:34.205 --> 14:37.739
Look, look, look, what's our...
what's our school motto?

14:37.775 --> 14:39.869
"Otters otter help each otter."

14:39.904 --> 14:41.374
Right.

14:42.379 --> 14:44.008
Right.

14:44.043 --> 14:46.082
Be a good little otter.

14:53.850 --> 14:56.719
He's rough on everyone.
Don't let him get to you.

15:02.498 --> 15:05.167
I'm surprised you haven't tried
to fix your friends yourself.

15:06.229 --> 15:07.906
I bet you could.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.480
-Abs, is that you?
-Yeah.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.175
All right. Perfect timing.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.248
You want to do this for me?

15:21.247 --> 15:23.816
You're hopeless.

15:23.851 --> 15:26.421
How was your day?

15:26.456 --> 15:28.053
Fine.

15:28.088 --> 15:30.052
Uh, anything exciting happen?

15:30.087 --> 15:32.526
Not really.

15:32.561 --> 15:34.262
Okay.

15:37.060 --> 15:38.096
There.

15:38.131 --> 15:39.729
What would you do without me?

15:41.738 --> 15:43.703
Thank you very much.

15:43.738 --> 15:46.205
Okay. Uh...

15:46.241 --> 15:49.879
Abs, I'm leaving a...
a 20 on the table

15:49.914 --> 15:51.606
so you can...
you can order a pizza.

15:51.642 --> 15:53.978
You remember how to call
and everything?

15:54.013 --> 15:55.848
Of course. I'm 11.

15:55.883 --> 15:57.454
I'm not a baby.

15:57.489 --> 15:58.955
I know. I know.

15:58.990 --> 16:01.185
Anything else you need from me
before I go?

16:01.220 --> 16:03.489
You gonna watch some TV or what?

16:05.631 --> 16:08.824
Maybe I could go see my friends.

16:11.937 --> 16:14.638
You mean, like,
your friends from school?

16:14.673 --> 16:18.100
I meant Chica and the others.

16:18.136 --> 16:19.973
Those friends.

16:20.008 --> 16:22.981
Look, Abs, we talked about this.

16:24.144 --> 16:25.812
Okay, you can't go back there.

16:25.847 --> 16:27.315
They're broken.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.789
Now, one day,
I'm gonna go fix them,

16:31.824 --> 16:33.957
but until then,
maybe you could try

16:33.992 --> 16:35.851
making some friends
with some real kids.

16:37.255 --> 16:39.187
My friends are real kids.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.827
We are in
the haunted courthouse.

16:47.599 --> 16:50.234
Did you guys hear that?

16:50.269 --> 16:51.970
Hear what?

16:52.006 --> 16:53.671
Look, you're right.

16:54.910 --> 16:57.011
Abs, I'm sorry, okay?

16:57.047 --> 16:58.506
It's just,
it's-it's complicated,

16:58.542 --> 17:00.010
but we can talk about it later.

17:00.046 --> 17:01.318
I have to go.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.751
Yeah.

17:06.788 --> 17:09.185
I love you.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.952
Mm-hmm.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.292
All right, don't-don't watch
too much of that show.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.200
It'll give you nightmares, okay?

17:21.706 --> 17:23.503
I'll be back later.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.829
-Pardon me, sir.
-Mm. Oh.

17:49.865 --> 17:51.102
There we are.

17:52.031 --> 17:53.599
Thank you.

17:56.969 --> 17:58.934
Hi.

18:03.914 --> 18:06.647
So this is what it's like?

18:06.682 --> 18:08.012
What?

18:08.048 --> 18:09.417
Being normal.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.713
Normal?

18:11.748 --> 18:13.581
Is that... Are we...
We're normal now?

18:13.616 --> 18:16.058
I think we're doing pretty good,

18:16.093 --> 18:18.426
considering what
we've been through.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.362
I just have too much time
on my hands.

18:22.398 --> 18:24.867
It'll be better
when I can get back to work.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.465
No, I think you're doing great.

18:26.501 --> 18:28.235
I mean, didn't you...
you signed up for, like,

18:28.270 --> 18:30.237
like, biking classes,
right, or...

18:30.272 --> 18:31.700
-Spin class.
-Spin class. Yeah, yeah.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.305
I've been going
a couple of weeks.

18:33.341 --> 18:35.071
-Okay.
-I even made some friends.

18:35.106 --> 18:36.814
Friends.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.315
What's that like?

18:43.415 --> 18:45.255
-Pardon my reach, madam.
-Oh.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.185
They... they love
doing that here.

18:53.163 --> 18:55.760
Um, you-you look great,
by the way.

18:59.637 --> 19:00.930
So do you.

19:02.832 --> 19:05.099
-This is a date.
-What?

19:06.175 --> 19:08.102
-What?
-Did you say something?

19:08.138 --> 19:10.277
No, I-I said... I said this is
a... a lovely day, a day.

19:10.313 --> 19:11.945
-Day. Today's been a great day.
-Yeah.

19:14.085 --> 19:16.517
Let me guess--
Abby tie that for you?

19:17.582 --> 19:19.583
-She did. Yeah.
-How is she?

19:19.618 --> 19:21.252
She's good.
Well, some days are good.

19:21.287 --> 19:23.359
Some days, she, uh...

19:25.021 --> 19:28.562
...she really misses them--
her "friends"--

19:28.597 --> 19:32.368
and, uh, I don't know
how to talk to her about it.

19:33.864 --> 19:35.797
I know you're trying
to protect her, Mike,

19:35.832 --> 19:38.174
but this story
that they're broken,

19:38.209 --> 19:40.305
that you're gonna fix
those animatronics,

19:40.340 --> 19:42.613
it's only giving her false hope.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.314
Just be honest.

19:45.308 --> 19:46.481
Honest?

19:47.519 --> 19:49.014
What?

19:49.049 --> 19:50.518
Uh, nothing.

19:54.018 --> 19:57.685
So, you want to...
tell me about your bad dream?

19:57.720 --> 20:00.030
It's always the same.

20:00.065 --> 20:02.158
We don't need to talk
about that.

20:02.193 --> 20:04.126
Your dad?

20:04.161 --> 20:06.567
Look, Vanessa, I was thinking,
do you remember how I would

20:06.602 --> 20:09.569
use my dreams to confront
what happened with Garrett?

20:09.605 --> 20:12.535
I mean, I admit I probably
slept a bit too much,

20:12.570 --> 20:15.010
but it really helped me a lot.

20:15.045 --> 20:17.039
I think it can help you, too.

20:18.044 --> 20:19.709
I...

20:19.744 --> 20:22.418
I-I don't think
that's a good idea.

20:24.519 --> 20:26.951
You're never gonna be free
of your dad

20:26.986 --> 20:29.887
until you deal with some of
the mess he left in your head.

20:29.923 --> 20:33.729
I just... I want us to be able
to move past all of this.

20:33.765 --> 20:35.995
You can do it.

20:36.031 --> 20:37.358
At least try.

20:37.394 --> 20:39.270
Just once.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.408
Abs, I'm back.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.375
Abby.

20:52.410 --> 20:54.175
Abs, did you eat?

20:55.181 --> 20:57.585
Abby? Abby?

21:00.185 --> 21:01.384
Abby!

22:00.850 --> 22:02.177
Hey.

22:05.154 --> 22:06.957
Abs, I'm sorry. I...

22:06.992 --> 22:08.788
I didn't know how to tell you.

22:10.488 --> 22:12.187
Where are they?

22:13.392 --> 22:15.298
I mean, there's...

22:15.333 --> 22:17.825
pieces of them here,
pieces of them there.

22:17.860 --> 22:20.332
No, that's not what I mean.

22:20.367 --> 22:22.263
Where are my friends?

22:26.813 --> 22:29.204
Look, Abs, I, um...

22:31.443 --> 22:33.675
I don't know.

22:33.710 --> 22:37.019
You know, maybe, um...

22:37.054 --> 22:39.049
maybe they're in heaven.

22:40.124 --> 22:42.659
Wouldn't you want that for them?

22:42.694 --> 22:44.322
Yeah.

22:44.357 --> 22:46.661
I would like that.

22:47.695 --> 22:50.632
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner, okay?

22:51.694 --> 22:53.830
But you know what?

22:53.865 --> 22:57.199
They're always gonna be
right here.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.811
That's really cheesy.

23:05.011 --> 23:07.215
-Yeah, it's a little cheesy.
-It's extremely cheesy.

23:07.250 --> 23:09.585
All right, all right, all right.

23:11.351 --> 23:12.517
You know what?

23:12.552 --> 23:14.920
Come with me. I got an idea.

23:16.158 --> 23:17.522
Okay, young lady.

23:17.557 --> 23:21.222
You have one million tickets.

23:21.258 --> 23:23.792
What can I get you?
Do you want some, uh... Oh.

23:23.827 --> 23:26.493
What about orange gummy candies?

23:26.529 --> 23:28.364
No?

23:28.399 --> 23:29.737
Okay.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.674
Uh, we got...

23:36.574 --> 23:38.815
Uh, let's see. Oh.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.550
What about this?

23:43.856 --> 23:46.890
Oh. Oh, maybe not.

23:58.564 --> 24:00.035
What you got there?

24:00.071 --> 24:02.372
It's a... FazTalker.

24:02.407 --> 24:04.831
"Realistic voice
interaction device.

24:04.867 --> 24:06.504
Talk to us anytime."

24:06.539 --> 24:08.138
Is that what you want?

24:10.377 --> 24:11.674
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

24:11.710 --> 24:13.411
Sold. One million tickets.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.454
Let's go home.

24:18.621 --> 24:20.854
I thought you liked
orange gummy candy.

24:20.889 --> 24:24.459
Well, I did until I ate
that whole bag at Christmas.

24:24.494 --> 24:26.455
Oh. And you threw it up
everywhere.

24:26.490 --> 24:27.858
Yeah.

24:27.894 --> 24:30.366
That was like an orange
slime waterfall.

24:30.402 --> 24:32.129
-It was really rough.
-Don't remind me.

25:08.135 --> 25:10.636
"
by Nine Days playing in van)

25:10.672 --> 25:12.468
You sure I'm going
the right way?

25:12.503 --> 25:14.000
Uh, yeah.

25:14.036 --> 25:16.779
No, it should be up ahead.

25:16.814 --> 25:19.473
How'd you guys find out
about this place again?

25:20.615 --> 25:22.117
Security guard who works there.

25:22.153 --> 25:23.983
His name is... Mike?

25:24.019 --> 25:26.785
I don't care who he is,
as long as we have permission.

25:26.821 --> 25:29.457
Trust me, we have
VIP treatment this time.

25:29.492 --> 25:31.353
No breaking and entering
required.

25:34.022 --> 25:36.624
Yeah, there. There it is.

26:00.149 --> 26:01.688
Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.

26:01.723 --> 26:04.490
I used to come here
when I was a kid.

26:04.525 --> 26:06.287
Not this one you didn't.

26:06.322 --> 26:08.489
You're thinking of
the franchise location.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.768
This is the original.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.670
Nobody's been here for decades.

26:15.705 --> 26:18.570
This location came
before the other one.

26:18.605 --> 26:21.475
So, what happened here?

26:21.510 --> 26:24.007
Some little girl got murdered.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.579
Whole thing got swept
under the rug.

26:25.614 --> 26:27.175
And now...

26:27.210 --> 26:30.053
her soul wanders
these forgotten halls,

26:30.089 --> 26:31.745
tortured and alone.

26:36.026 --> 26:37.161
Dude.

26:37.196 --> 26:41.060
Uh, sorry. You startled us.

26:42.595 --> 26:44.497
You must be Mike.

26:44.532 --> 26:46.967
It's Michael, actually.

26:50.735 --> 26:52.533
Call me Michael.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.413
So?

26:58.448 --> 27:00.380
Are you ready for the tour?

27:14.133 --> 27:16.128
Welcome to Freddy's.

27:18.162 --> 27:20.134
You're cool
if we record everything?

27:20.170 --> 27:21.463
Of course.

27:22.573 --> 27:24.602
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

27:26.311 --> 27:29.108
No way. They had a boat ride?

27:30.440 --> 27:33.611
This restaurant had a lot
of unique features.

27:33.647 --> 27:35.576
Like the Marionette.

27:38.817 --> 27:40.614
You did your homework.

27:41.619 --> 27:42.921
Yeah.

27:42.956 --> 27:46.086
The Marionette truly was
one of a kind.

27:46.121 --> 27:48.326
What's the Marionette?

27:48.362 --> 27:50.928
The Marionette would come out
of this trapdoor on the stage

27:50.964 --> 27:52.526
and direct
the other animatronics

27:52.561 --> 27:54.336
-during performances.
-That's right.

27:54.371 --> 27:56.563
Using a wireless signal.

27:56.599 --> 27:59.903
The technology was way ahead
of its time, but...

27:59.938 --> 28:01.976
they never made another one.

28:03.982 --> 28:05.441
Shall we?

28:38.214 --> 28:39.882
Whoa.

28:45.081 --> 28:46.885
They look brand-new.

28:46.920 --> 28:51.161
Freddy, Bonnie and Chica.

28:51.197 --> 28:54.094
Uh, what about Foxy?

28:55.091 --> 28:57.195
Oh. Foxy was involved in

28:57.231 --> 29:00.361
a failed take-apart,
put-back-together attraction

29:00.396 --> 29:03.499
and was never
quite the same again.

29:05.541 --> 29:07.707
Kids can be so heartless.

29:14.682 --> 29:16.281
You guys hear that?

29:20.425 --> 29:22.859
It was, like... music or...

29:24.958 --> 29:26.721
Uh, fair warning:

29:26.756 --> 29:30.031
This place will prey on
your imagination if you let it.

29:30.961 --> 29:33.133
Shall we continue?

29:34.133 --> 29:37.104
Hey. I'm gonna catch up
to you guys.

29:37.139 --> 29:41.703
I don't know, I wanted
to look around a little bit.

29:41.738 --> 29:44.370
Mikey boy, let's, uh...
let's get the show on the road.

29:44.406 --> 29:46.676
I'm burning valuable tape here.

29:49.316 --> 29:52.345
What do we, uh...
what do we got over here?

30:43.966 --> 30:45.634
Shit!

30:53.945 --> 30:55.344
What the hell?

30:55.379 --> 30:57.453
What kind of kid
would want to come here?

30:57.488 --> 30:59.615
"Kids Cove."

31:01.019 --> 31:02.959
Awesome.

31:02.995 --> 31:06.588
You know, I think this might be
our best episode yet.

31:06.623 --> 31:12.361
Yeah, usually,
we got to play it up, you know.

31:12.397 --> 31:14.364
We have to make it
something it's not,

31:14.399 --> 31:17.006
but this place is actually
pretty creepy.

32:44.625 --> 32:46.425
Lisa?

32:51.261 --> 32:53.069
Wh-What did you do?

32:54.065 --> 32:55.896
What did you do?

32:59.009 --> 33:02.240
Lisa? Lisa, I-I'm coming.
Where are you?

33:12.853 --> 33:14.248
Hello?

33:14.283 --> 33:16.083
N-N-N-N-N-No, no!

33:21.492 --> 33:24.127
What the hell was that?

33:31.169 --> 33:32.706
Where'd they all go?

33:41.112 --> 33:42.976
Shit, shit, shit.

33:53.356 --> 33:55.395
No, no, no!

35:05.967 --> 35:08.435
Welcome back, Charlotte.

35:18.242 --> 35:19.740
Come on.

35:19.775 --> 35:21.912
Please work.
Please work. Please work.

35:21.947 --> 35:23.278
Please.

35:34.060 --> 35:36.463
I miss you guys.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.904
Hello?

35:43.939 --> 35:45.835
Can you guys hear me?

35:48.609 --> 35:51.346
Chica, can you hear me?

35:54.816 --> 35:57.077
I need you.

35:58.085 --> 36:00.355
I miss you all so much.

36:10.727 --> 36:12.032
All right, all right.

36:12.068 --> 36:13.660
Welcome to the class, you guys.

36:13.696 --> 36:15.303
Today I got a plan for you all,

36:15.339 --> 36:17.098
so we're gonna get you guys
nice and warmed up.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.466
Whenever you are ready,
go ahead and turn to the right.

36:20.502 --> 36:22.638
Keep pedaling.

36:22.673 --> 36:25.474
I'm glad you decided
to join us again.

36:25.509 --> 36:27.448
You can do this.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.743
Feel your core start to engage.

36:30.779 --> 36:33.322
Another full turn to the right.

36:34.457 --> 36:36.918
♪ When I see out of
the corner of my eye ♪

36:36.954 --> 36:38.953
♪ "Look who's here"
and "How you doing?" ♪

36:38.989 --> 36:41.756
♪ Why don't you tell me
who let you in... ♪

36:41.791 --> 36:45.264
Feel your quads
start to activate.

36:45.300 --> 36:48.264
Three, two, one,
turn to the right.

36:48.300 --> 36:49.931
One, two, one, two.

36:49.966 --> 36:51.938
One, two, one two.
Again. This is your moment.

36:51.974 --> 36:53.539
Be here. Be present.

36:53.575 --> 36:54.611
-WILLIAM:<i> Faster.</i>
-You can do this.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.305
Push it all away.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.676
<i>Faster.</i>

37:04.920 --> 37:06.223
<i>Faster.</i>

37:08.660 --> 37:09.919
<i>-Faster!</i>

37:28.913 --> 37:30.379
<i>-</i>

37:32.047 --> 37:35.285
Please. Vanessa, easy.

38:20.226 --> 38:22.057
You can do this.

38:24.296 --> 38:26.061
You can do this.

39:34.573 --> 39:35.900
Dad?

39:39.339 --> 39:42.170
I'm not afraid of you.

39:45.345 --> 39:48.242
I don't need you anymore.

39:53.254 --> 39:56.151
I am nothing like you.

40:03.759 --> 40:05.668
No, no, no. Come on.

40:05.703 --> 40:06.900
Help me!

40:17.575 --> 40:19.509
I'm not done with you.

40:19.544 --> 40:21.880
You can't keep me here.

40:23.546 --> 40:24.847
I'm leaving.

40:24.882 --> 40:28.255
Don't you know
you're my favorite?

40:28.291 --> 40:31.821
Don't you know that I love you?

40:31.856 --> 40:36.026
Don't you know
that I care about you?

40:42.872 --> 40:44.232
Oh.

40:49.111 --> 40:51.378
You are my child.

40:51.413 --> 40:54.407
You have a purpose.

41:22.104 --> 41:24.239
Where are you gonna run to?

41:47.599 --> 41:49.971
You will always be mine.

41:50.006 --> 41:51.334
No!

42:17.167 --> 42:19.866
You shall always be mine.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.993
TOY VOICE:
A...

42:46.028 --> 42:50.028
B-B-Y.

42:53.664 --> 42:56.199
Abby, help us.

42:57.699 --> 42:59.570
Chica?

42:59.606 --> 43:02.506
Chica, Chica, is that you?

43:02.542 --> 43:05.343
Yes. Please help us.

43:05.379 --> 43:07.246
Where are you?

43:07.282 --> 43:10.016
Come find me.

43:10.052 --> 43:11.384
How?

43:11.419 --> 43:15.053
I will show you the way.

43:51.921 --> 43:53.196
Hurry.

43:53.231 --> 43:55.194
We are all waiting for you.

44:11.641 --> 44:13.012
Whoa.

44:30.025 --> 44:31.998
What is this place?

44:39.768 --> 44:41.370
Chica?

44:42.507 --> 44:44.307
Freddy?

44:47.710 --> 44:49.444
Bonnie?

44:57.423 --> 44:58.690
Chica?

44:58.725 --> 45:02.030
Abby, you've come back to us.

45:02.065 --> 45:03.898
Chica!

45:06.501 --> 45:08.798
I've missed you so much.

45:08.833 --> 45:11.004
I've missed you, too.

45:12.002 --> 45:13.802
How did you get this new body?

45:13.837 --> 45:15.668
Do you like it?

45:17.974 --> 45:20.283
It's neat, but it's...

45:20.318 --> 45:23.577
different and kind of cold.

45:24.751 --> 45:26.618
You said you needed my help?

45:26.653 --> 45:29.316
We do, but right now,

45:29.352 --> 45:32.157
what matters is
we're together again.

46:04.919 --> 46:06.554
Mike?

46:08.593 --> 46:10.332
Mike?

46:20.473 --> 46:22.471
Abby?

46:33.885 --> 46:35.358
Gotcha!

46:36.925 --> 46:38.727
Haven't you ever played
hide-and-seek?

46:38.763 --> 46:40.689
First rule is
always check behind the doors.

46:40.724 --> 46:42.621
Right.

46:42.657 --> 46:45.129
-Where is your brother?
-Getting breakfast.

46:45.164 --> 46:47.093
Do you want to see
my science fair project?

46:47.128 --> 46:49.300
It's finally done.

46:50.835 --> 46:52.232
Wow.

46:52.267 --> 46:54.310
You made this all by yourself?

46:54.345 --> 46:57.075
Well, no. Chica helped.

46:57.111 --> 47:00.942
Freddy tried,
but his fingers were too fat.

47:00.978 --> 47:02.984
Pretty cool, right?

47:04.078 --> 47:05.412
Very cool.

47:05.447 --> 47:08.283
You said Freddy and Chica
helped you?

47:08.318 --> 47:10.786
Yeah, in their old house,
last night.

47:10.822 --> 47:12.455
It's so neat.

47:12.490 --> 47:15.956
It's got a play area for
little kids and even a river.

47:15.992 --> 47:18.162
Wait. A river?

47:18.197 --> 47:19.464
Abs, I'm back.

47:19.500 --> 47:20.628
Breakfast!

47:30.945 --> 47:32.780
Hey. Uh, they didn't
have chocolate,

47:32.815 --> 47:35.478
so I got banana
and, uh, blueberry.

47:36.783 --> 47:39.079
What do we got here?

47:39.115 --> 47:41.050
Hey. These are cool.

47:41.085 --> 47:42.786
These are really good, Abs.

47:42.821 --> 47:45.185
Vanessa's here.

47:45.220 --> 47:47.457
-Hey.
-Hey.

47:48.629 --> 47:50.394
We need to talk.

47:51.829 --> 47:53.232
Yeah, we do.

47:55.366 --> 47:57.334
What is this?
I don't understand.

47:57.369 --> 48:00.204
Yeah, neither did I
until I called the number.

48:00.239 --> 48:03.009
Listen, we really need
to talk about Abby.

48:03.044 --> 48:05.713
She said she's been
with Freddy and Chica.

48:05.749 --> 48:07.780
Yeah, it's just
this toy she has,

48:07.815 --> 48:09.275
this new Faz-speaker thing.

48:09.311 --> 48:10.719
No, she said she saw them.

48:10.754 --> 48:12.411
-She said she went somewhere.
-Okay.

48:12.446 --> 48:14.219
You know, Vanessa, I-I've...

48:14.255 --> 48:17.451
I've been trying really hard
to-to move forward.

48:17.486 --> 48:20.557
-I know, but, Mike...
-Um, no, listen.

48:20.592 --> 48:24.461
How can I move forward when
it's one thing after another?

48:24.496 --> 48:27.226
Look, I hear you. I do.
It's just what Abby said...

48:27.261 --> 48:29.038
Abby's just a kid.

48:29.073 --> 48:31.973
And right now she's hurting
and she misses her friends,

48:32.008 --> 48:33.808
and there's nothing
that I can do to help her.

48:33.844 --> 48:36.139
The same way that
I couldn't help Garrett.

48:36.175 --> 48:39.140
Or-or the other kids
at Freddy's.

48:39.176 --> 48:41.115
Other kids like Charlotte.

48:43.882 --> 48:45.278
How do you...

48:45.313 --> 48:47.220
Her dad made that flyer.

48:48.515 --> 48:49.890
And so I called him, and he...

48:49.925 --> 48:52.055
and he told me about
his little girl

48:52.090 --> 48:53.987
and her best friend Vanessa.

48:55.961 --> 48:57.426
Wh-Why didn't you tell me

48:57.461 --> 48:59.427
that there were other victims,
other kids?

48:59.462 --> 49:02.104
My father was a monster.
You know that.

49:02.140 --> 49:05.368
Look, a-all I'm trying to do is
I'm trying to fix my family.

49:05.403 --> 49:06.970
I'm trying to fix
the situation for Abby.

49:07.005 --> 49:08.337
I'm trying to fix you,

49:08.372 --> 49:10.309
-and-and I don't...
-Wait. W-Wait.

49:11.980 --> 49:13.907
Is that what this
has been about?

49:13.943 --> 49:15.578
No.

49:17.246 --> 49:19.285
You're trying to fix me?

49:23.751 --> 49:26.355
You know what?
I can take care of myself.

49:26.390 --> 49:28.327
You just need
to watch out for Abby.

49:45.339 --> 49:47.774
Hey, Abs, um...

49:47.809 --> 49:49.814
do you think that
you can get set up without me?

49:49.849 --> 49:51.315
You're not coming?

49:51.351 --> 49:52.920
No, no, I'm... yeah,
I'm coming. I just, uh...

49:52.956 --> 49:54.416
I just have to go
do something real quick,

49:54.451 --> 49:55.890
but I-I'll be back
before it starts.

49:55.925 --> 49:57.923
-Don't be too long, though.
-Okay.

49:57.958 --> 50:00.425
Hey. You're gonna do great.

50:01.496 --> 50:02.823
Thanks.

51:28.045 --> 51:29.613
Charlotte?

51:32.084 --> 51:34.552
It's just me, Vanessa.

51:37.194 --> 51:39.293
Are you here
to put me back to sleep?

51:40.631 --> 51:42.428
I know what you want.

51:43.762 --> 51:46.564
You want to get out of here
so that you can hurt people.

51:47.936 --> 51:49.897
The way that they hurt you.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.499
But I can't let that happen.

51:54.535 --> 51:56.244
I'm out of the box.

51:57.541 --> 52:00.514
But you still
have me trapped here.

52:00.549 --> 52:02.410
Somehow.

52:02.445 --> 52:04.710
It's called a perimeter lock.

52:04.746 --> 52:07.156
None of the animatronics
can leave.

52:08.416 --> 52:10.725
Not even you.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.821
But you can fix that.

52:14.423 --> 52:16.232
I'm not gonna do that.

52:16.267 --> 52:20.895
That's okay. I have another
friend who can help me now.

52:20.930 --> 52:25.072
I don't hate you, but you need
to stay out of my way.

52:32.678 --> 52:34.282
You're gonna be great,
honey. Don't worry.

52:56.969 --> 52:58.440
Excuse me.

52:58.475 --> 53:01.139
Uh, Abby.

53:01.174 --> 53:02.805
Do you know where my booth is?

53:02.840 --> 53:06.182
Uh, uh, I thought you decided
not to participate.

53:07.183 --> 53:09.981
Yeah, it's a little late
to be setting up.

53:10.017 --> 53:11.482
No, it's not. Look.

53:11.518 --> 53:13.517
-I can set up over there.
-Look, uh,

53:13.553 --> 53:16.187
I just don't want you
to be embarrassed, Abby.

53:16.222 --> 53:17.990
Why would I be embarrassed?

53:18.025 --> 53:20.229
I'm proud of my project.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.127
Of course you are. Yeah.

53:23.162 --> 53:25.090
So am I. Here, let me...

53:25.126 --> 53:27.459
Let's just find the perfect
place to display it.

53:27.495 --> 53:28.963
Oh!

53:31.367 --> 53:33.467
Oh! Oh, oh, sorry.

53:33.502 --> 53:35.107
I'm so, so sorry, Abby.

53:35.142 --> 53:37.746
I-I got, uh, butterfingers. I...

53:37.781 --> 53:39.344
I tell you what I'll do.

53:39.380 --> 53:42.107
I'll give you full credit
for the class.

53:42.143 --> 53:45.644
And this way, you can just
go home, and... and...

53:45.679 --> 53:48.081
I'll take out this trash.

53:52.260 --> 53:54.222
You're such a dick, Mr. Berg.

53:54.258 --> 53:56.089
Who said that?

54:16.282 --> 54:18.379
Abby, what's wrong?

54:18.414 --> 54:21.254
Mr. Berg, he...

54:21.289 --> 54:24.018
he destroyed
my science fair project.

54:25.027 --> 54:27.862
I'll be your science project.

54:27.897 --> 54:29.487
You'd do that for me?

54:29.523 --> 54:30.789
Of course.

54:30.825 --> 54:32.227
Well, come on. We got to hurry.

54:32.262 --> 54:34.530
But first...

54:34.565 --> 54:37.205
I need you to do
something for me.

54:37.240 --> 54:40.639
Remember how I said
we needed your help?

54:49.443 --> 54:53.113
There is a secret code
that will let me come with you.

54:54.990 --> 54:57.183
Will you enter it for me?

55:00.487 --> 55:01.924
Okay.

55:21.112 --> 55:22.577
N-No!

55:22.612 --> 55:24.076
-No!
-If you don't give me

55:24.111 --> 55:26.545
the command to release
the perimeter lock,

55:26.581 --> 55:28.386
I will kill her.

55:28.422 --> 55:31.821
Charlotte, listen to me.

55:31.856 --> 55:34.858
I know you're angry,
but it's not Abby's fault.

55:35.991 --> 55:38.125
I know you.
I know you wouldn't hurt her.

55:39.134 --> 55:40.894
What do I type?

55:40.929 --> 55:43.471
Are you willing
to take that chance?

55:50.341 --> 55:51.571
Abby!

55:54.245 --> 55:56.046
Okay. Okay.

55:56.081 --> 55:57.551
Okay.

55:58.545 --> 56:00.114
Four.

56:01.086 --> 56:02.184
Four.

56:02.219 --> 56:05.858
A. E.

56:05.893 --> 56:07.827
Seven.

56:07.862 --> 56:10.764
X. C. D.

56:10.799 --> 56:12.864
C. D.

56:12.900 --> 56:14.526
One.

56:14.561 --> 56:15.770
Now what?

56:15.805 --> 56:17.901
Hit "enter."

56:46.564 --> 56:50.164
You did it, Abby. We're free.

56:58.105 --> 56:59.707
We better hurry
if we want to get

56:59.742 --> 57:01.516
to the science fair in time.

57:02.887 --> 57:04.750
I only have my bike.

57:06.881 --> 57:08.622
How are we going to get there?

57:13.022 --> 57:15.154
♪ 'Cause I hear it
in the night ♪

57:15.189 --> 57:18.434
♪ I hear the secrets
that you keep ♪

57:19.568 --> 57:21.164
♪ When you're talking
in your sleep... ♪

57:21.199 --> 57:22.534
Where to?

57:22.570 --> 57:24.831
Oh, you again?
You got to be kidding me.

57:24.866 --> 57:26.408
Kid...

57:26.443 --> 57:28.811
get out of this cab right...

57:32.476 --> 57:33.909
Oh, my goodness!

57:33.944 --> 57:38.454
Oh, Chica, you, uh,
dropped this.

57:39.484 --> 57:42.117
Thank you, Abby.

57:44.357 --> 57:46.286
I got to get a new job.

58:06.950 --> 58:08.442
Mike?

58:08.477 --> 58:09.776
Yeah.

58:09.811 --> 58:12.316
Uh, thanks for seeing me.

58:12.351 --> 58:14.314
Come on inside.

58:20.288 --> 58:22.755
Honestly, I was surprised
to get your call.

58:24.567 --> 58:27.129
The only calls I've gotten
so far have been...

58:29.033 --> 58:32.138
...prank calls,
kids asking to order a pizza,

58:32.173 --> 58:34.441
things like that.

58:34.476 --> 58:36.507
Sure I can't offer you
a cup, Mike?

58:36.542 --> 58:38.171
Oh, no, I'm-I'm fine. Thank you.

58:38.206 --> 58:41.949
Um, I don't know
what I'm doing here, really.

58:41.985 --> 58:43.685
I just, um...

58:43.720 --> 58:46.584
I don't really have anyone else
I can talk to about this.

58:46.619 --> 58:48.480
I'm just looking
for some answers.

58:49.487 --> 58:51.917
You know, I...

58:51.952 --> 58:53.762
I wasn't the best father.

58:53.797 --> 58:55.958
I was...

58:55.994 --> 58:59.126
I was obsessed by my work
when I was younger,

58:59.161 --> 59:02.036
and it eventually...

59:02.072 --> 59:03.962
cost me everything.

59:03.997 --> 59:06.304
Including my little girl.

59:06.340 --> 59:08.335
I'm sorry.

59:11.312 --> 59:12.711
You know, on the phone,

59:12.746 --> 59:16.178
you said that Charlotte died
at Freddy's?

59:17.584 --> 59:19.549
Everyone called it an accident.

59:19.584 --> 59:21.514
I had my suspicions about

59:21.549 --> 59:23.491
what had really happened,
but it wasn't until years later

59:23.526 --> 59:25.886
when those five children
went missing that...

59:25.922 --> 59:30.557
that I knew she was murdered...

59:30.592 --> 59:32.194
by him.

59:35.605 --> 59:39.102
I can only assume
that you lost someone as well.

59:40.341 --> 59:42.902
It's my little brother.

59:42.937 --> 59:45.546
I'm sorry for your loss.

59:45.582 --> 59:49.010
It's so easy to become
so blinded by ambition

59:49.045 --> 59:50.750
that even with
the best of intentions

59:50.786 --> 59:54.513
you don't see the devil
sitting right beside you.

59:54.549 --> 59:57.516
And now this Fazfest business,
it's brought it all back.

59:57.551 --> 01:00:00.989
It's an abomination,
people celebrating that place.

01:00:01.024 --> 01:00:03.598
That's why I posted
those flyers.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:06.063
-People need to know the truth.
-Wait, what...

01:00:07.701 --> 01:00:10.402
Where-where is this?
What is this?

01:00:10.437 --> 01:00:12.407
It's the-the river ride.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.336
It was one of
Charlotte's favorites.

01:00:14.371 --> 01:00:17.776
But I-I've been to Freddy's.
There's not a-a river ride.

01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:19.513
There was only one
at the first Freddy's.

01:00:19.548 --> 01:00:21.643
None of the later locations
had one.

01:00:21.678 --> 01:00:23.718
First Freddy's?

01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:27.915
Abby drew this.

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:29.686
Uh, c-can I use your phone?

01:00:29.722 --> 01:00:31.550
Yeah, of course.
It's over there.

01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:37.456
Hello?

01:00:37.492 --> 01:00:39.232
And you're sure she isn't there?

01:00:39.267 --> 01:00:40.967
I'm so sorry, sir.

01:00:41.002 --> 01:00:44.164
Apparently, there was some sort
of incident and she left.

01:00:44.199 --> 01:00:46.670
But if you'd like,
I can call the...

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:51.746
What an asshole.

01:00:53.073 --> 01:00:54.549
Is everything all right?

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:57.481
I, uh... I don't...
I-I don't know. Um...

01:00:57.517 --> 01:00:58.951
I think my sister...

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:02.691
I think she's here.

01:01:03.687 --> 01:01:05.460
One-two-five...

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.759
-two-five...
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:09.164
I made this music box
for Charlotte

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:10.364
when she was just a baby.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.228
The music, it helped her sleep.

01:01:12.264 --> 01:01:14.698
I know this might sound crazy,
but if you go back there,

01:01:14.733 --> 01:01:16.804
would you leave it for her?

01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:20.599
Uh, yeah.

01:01:22.144 --> 01:01:23.877
Thank you.

01:01:44.561 --> 01:01:45.965
Abby?

01:01:51.238 --> 01:01:52.906
Abby!

01:02:49.428 --> 01:02:50.957
Abby?

01:03:14.285 --> 01:03:16.414
Whoa! A giant robot.

01:03:16.449 --> 01:03:18.090
Excuse me. Pardon me.

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:19.617
-Look, it's Chica!
-Excuse me. Clear out.

01:03:19.653 --> 01:03:21.124
-Whoa.
-What's going on over here?

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.722
Mr. Berg, this is my new
science fair project.

01:03:24.729 --> 01:03:26.060
Mr. Berg,

01:03:26.095 --> 01:03:28.628
I've heard so much about you.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.869
Is this a joke, Miss Schmidt?

01:03:33.904 --> 01:03:35.709
Putting someone in a suit

01:03:35.744 --> 01:03:38.140
and passing it off
as your own work?

01:03:38.175 --> 01:03:40.140
You're an embarrassment
to our class

01:03:40.175 --> 01:03:42.149
and to our school, Miss Schmidt.

01:03:42.184 --> 01:03:46.421
Now, take your freak-show friend
and get out of my science fair!

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:48.516
Before you lose us the title.

01:03:52.988 --> 01:03:54.892
I'm sorry, Chica.

01:03:54.928 --> 01:03:57.162
There is nothing
to be sorry about.

01:03:59.227 --> 01:04:01.963
How about I go talk to him?

01:04:01.998 --> 01:04:03.429
What are you gonna say?

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:05.636
I just want to see
what's going on

01:04:05.672 --> 01:04:08.309
inside of his head.

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:11.771
-Whoa.
-Wow.

01:04:11.807 --> 01:04:13.412
No.

01:04:13.448 --> 01:04:14.814
I'm on my way.

01:04:14.849 --> 01:04:17.248
I-I just left my keys
in my office.

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:19.547
Again.

01:04:21.823 --> 01:04:23.824
This part of the building
is closed!

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.955
Now, get out of here.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:28.328
Before I have you both expelled.

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:30.822
Geez.

01:06:02.616 --> 01:06:04.416
I would like to talk to you

01:06:04.452 --> 01:06:07.923
about Abby's project, Mr. Berg.

01:06:20.907 --> 01:06:23.205
I'll give her an "A"!

01:06:23.241 --> 01:06:26.080
You-you...
you want test answers?

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:29.647
I'll-I'll give you
answers to the next test.

01:06:36.658 --> 01:06:38.958
What I want is to see

01:06:38.993 --> 01:06:42.760
what's going on
inside of your head.

01:06:59.009 --> 01:07:00.543
Just as I thought.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.844
Nothing in there at all.

01:07:11.151 --> 01:07:13.028
Abby?

01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:31.512
Abby?

01:07:38.753 --> 01:07:40.088
Vanessa.

01:07:41.084 --> 01:07:42.457
Are you okay?

01:07:43.724 --> 01:07:45.123
I'm okay.

01:07:45.158 --> 01:07:46.961
What's going on?
Where-where's Abby?

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:50.029
I don't know where
she is exactly, but...

01:07:50.064 --> 01:07:52.792
she left with them,
the animatronics.

01:07:52.827 --> 01:07:54.663
I just saw the animatronics
in-in a back room.

01:07:54.698 --> 01:07:58.869
No, those are just prototypes
used for spare parts.

01:07:58.904 --> 01:08:00.399
It's Charlotte.

01:08:00.434 --> 01:08:02.006
She's behind everything.

01:08:02.041 --> 01:08:04.978
I think Abby might be in danger.

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:07.245
We need to get
to the security office.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.551
It's the only way
I know how to help her.

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:12.681
Come on.

01:08:15.587 --> 01:08:18.720
I know you don't want to,
but you have to trust me.

01:08:23.828 --> 01:08:25.430
Okay.

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.766
Is there another way?

01:08:34.843 --> 01:08:36.903
Come on.

01:08:38.373 --> 01:08:39.538
I don't understand.

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:41.408
Are-are the ghost kids here now?

01:08:41.443 --> 01:08:44.112
No, there's just one ghost here.

01:08:44.147 --> 01:08:45.648
In the Marionette.

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:47.919
Charlotte.

01:08:47.954 --> 01:08:49.253
After she was killed,

01:08:49.288 --> 01:08:51.126
I would sometimes
still see her here.

01:08:53.059 --> 01:08:55.787
<i>She seemed stuck</i>

01:08:55.823 --> 01:08:59.159
<i>in the last emotion</i>
<i>before she died.</i>

01:09:01.096 --> 01:09:02.830
Rage.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:08.000
But there's this music box
that kept her asleep.

01:09:30.893 --> 01:09:32.992
<i>I put her to sleep</i>
<i>with this music box, but...</i>

01:09:34.267 --> 01:09:36.699
...something or someone
broke it.

01:09:37.699 --> 01:09:40.103
Wait. Henry just gave me
a music box.

01:09:43.937 --> 01:09:46.372
Maybe coming this way
was a bad idea.

01:09:46.408 --> 01:09:47.944
Hurry.

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.317
Mike.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:04.023
Here. Here. Grab my hand.

01:10:12.398 --> 01:10:13.868
Mike!

01:10:16.908 --> 01:10:18.510
Come on.

01:10:24.016 --> 01:10:25.511
Okay. Come on.

01:10:25.547 --> 01:10:27.178
Come on, come on, come on.

01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:32.722
Where are you?

01:10:32.757 --> 01:10:35.194
Vanessa, what are we doing here?
How-how do we find Abby?

01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:37.791
I'm trying to pull up
the tracker.

01:10:37.827 --> 01:10:39.666
Abby thinks these animatronics
are her friends,

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:41.335
but they're not.

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.428
They're being wirelessly
controlled by the Marionette.

01:10:43.464 --> 01:10:44.706
By Charlotte.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.538
Wh-What does she want?

01:10:48.201 --> 01:10:50.668
My father killed her,
but she doesn't blame him.

01:10:50.703 --> 01:10:52.910
She blames the parents.

01:10:52.945 --> 01:10:54.312
All parents.

01:10:54.348 --> 01:10:56.108
Okay. What does she want
with my sister?

01:10:56.144 --> 01:11:00.020
It seems like the Marionette
needs something or someone

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:02.122
to bond to
in order to move around.

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:04.188
I'm afraid it might
target Abby next.

01:11:04.223 --> 01:11:06.192
So there's four animatronics,

01:11:06.227 --> 01:11:08.263
and we don't know
which one has Abby.

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:12.532
They're all out because the
perimeter locks were disabled.

01:11:12.567 --> 01:11:15.399
It's a system that drains
the animatronics of their power

01:11:15.434 --> 01:11:17.229
the moment they leave
the building.

01:11:17.264 --> 01:11:20.268
But we can find them once we
get their trackers working.

01:11:20.303 --> 01:11:21.669
Wait.

01:11:21.704 --> 01:11:23.074
D-Did you say
that the Marionette

01:11:23.109 --> 01:11:24.479
controls them wirelessly?

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:25.775
Yeah.

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:29.479
Get up.

01:11:29.514 --> 01:11:31.409
Look, you-you go...
you go into town,

01:11:31.444 --> 01:11:33.452
find Charlotte and just try to
buy me as much time as you can,

01:11:33.488 --> 01:11:35.854
and I'll try to disconnect
the signal from here.

01:11:35.889 --> 01:11:37.692
Okay. Here.

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:39.126
We can use these.

01:11:39.162 --> 01:11:42.525
Mike, I should have told you
about her.

01:11:42.561 --> 01:11:44.598
I should have told you
about this place.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.429
I-I, um...

01:11:51.001 --> 01:11:53.268
Hey, don't worry about that
right now, okay? Just-just go.

01:11:53.303 --> 01:11:54.441
-Please.
-Okay.

01:11:57.507 --> 01:11:59.109
Hey, how do I close the door?

01:11:59.145 --> 01:12:00.480
There isn't a door.

01:12:01.477 --> 01:12:03.318
There isn't a door?

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.817
What kind of idiot
designed this place?

01:12:10.589 --> 01:12:12.583
All right,
where the hell are you guys?

01:12:12.619 --> 01:12:14.192
Okay.

01:12:14.227 --> 01:12:17.421
Maybe no one will notice them.

01:12:35.181 --> 01:12:37.343
Dude, that costume is...

01:12:37.379 --> 01:12:38.983
Legendary.

01:12:39.019 --> 01:12:40.712
I don't know.

01:12:40.747 --> 01:12:42.615
Seems kind of fake to me.

01:12:42.651 --> 01:12:44.181
-Don't be rude.
-What?

01:12:44.216 --> 01:12:46.118
I mean, it just looks
like a toy, is all.

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:47.993
Hey, we're on the way
to the costume contest.

01:12:48.028 --> 01:12:49.155
You want to come?

01:12:50.459 --> 01:12:53.434
I do, but first,

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:57.671
I have to go pull the heads
off some very bad people.

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.473
Right on.

01:13:02.469 --> 01:13:04.579
He wins.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.507
Yeah.

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:27.868
Okay.

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.635
Here goes nothing.

01:14:26.391 --> 01:14:28.126
Okay, come on.

01:14:28.162 --> 01:14:29.521
Yes!

01:14:29.556 --> 01:14:30.721
Vanessa.

01:14:30.757 --> 01:14:32.423
Hey.

01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:34.896
-Any luck over there?
-I located the first tracker.

01:14:34.932 --> 01:14:37.401
Freddy is at 175 West Elm.
Can you get there?

01:14:37.437 --> 01:14:38.935
Copy that. I'm close.

01:14:43.806 --> 01:14:45.311
Harry, come inside.

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:47.706
You're letting in
the mosquitoes.

01:14:49.209 --> 01:14:52.311
Mosquitoes,
mosquitoes, mosquitoes.

01:15:12.338 --> 01:15:14.707
How is there not a door?

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.978
There's no way that'll work.

01:15:26.316 --> 01:15:28.149
Okay.

01:15:32.292 --> 01:15:34.025
Come on. Where are you?

01:15:46.337 --> 01:15:48.037
Sleep tight.

01:16:11.662 --> 01:16:13.893
Hello?

01:16:13.928 --> 01:16:15.964
I hate this place.

01:16:17.534 --> 01:16:19.303
Mike, you okay?

01:16:28.742 --> 01:16:30.646
Holy shit.

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.351
Please, come on.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.255
Come on!

01:17:58.338 --> 01:18:00.103
I'm going to bed.

01:18:03.107 --> 01:18:05.138
You're invited to Fazfest.

01:18:05.173 --> 01:18:06.972
Come celebrate
with Bonnie, Foxy, Chica

01:18:07.007 --> 01:18:08.472
and, of course, Freddy.

01:18:08.507 --> 01:18:10.778
Scrumptious snacks,
marvelous merchandise...

01:18:10.814 --> 01:18:13.010
Did you leave a door open?

01:18:13.045 --> 01:18:15.019
I feel a draft.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:38.479
You left me to die.

01:18:38.514 --> 01:18:40.675
What? What did we do?

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:43.212
All of you did.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.511
No!

01:18:58.257 --> 01:19:00.559
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:19:02.566 --> 01:19:03.962
Here. Here.

01:19:03.998 --> 01:19:05.804
You okay? It's okay.

01:19:05.839 --> 01:19:07.233
Is there anyone else
inside of the house?

01:19:07.268 --> 01:19:10.167
Just us. And... them.

01:19:10.203 --> 01:19:11.545
What are they?

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.310
We need to get out of here
right now.

01:19:13.345 --> 01:19:14.441
Come on.

01:19:22.521 --> 01:19:24.423
Whoa!

01:19:24.458 --> 01:19:26.926
Please, please, please.

01:19:47.875 --> 01:19:49.542
That worked.

01:19:51.981 --> 01:19:54.551
I'm Debbie. What's your name?

01:19:54.586 --> 01:19:56.356
My name is Bonnie.

01:19:56.392 --> 01:19:58.620
Can we be friends, Debbie?

01:19:58.656 --> 01:20:01.288
Sure, we can.

01:20:01.324 --> 01:20:03.460
Debbie,
stop talking to your animals

01:20:03.496 --> 01:20:04.931
and go to sleep.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:10.728
I'm gonna go see if your mom
will let us stay up late.

01:20:13.437 --> 01:20:15.368
Now, if you're
headed downtown this evening,

01:20:15.403 --> 01:20:17.543
you may want to be
on the lookout for bears.

01:20:17.578 --> 01:20:19.613
No, the circus isn't in town.

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:21.979
Tonight marks
the inaugural Fazfest,

01:20:22.015 --> 01:20:24.451
the local grassroots,
cultural arts festival

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:25.776
celebrating the nostalgic...

01:20:52.642 --> 01:20:54.178
Oh, no.

01:21:19.232 --> 01:21:20.668
Okay. Come on, Mike.

01:21:20.703 --> 01:21:22.232
Come on.

01:21:22.267 --> 01:21:24.010
It's now or never.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:26.205
...long defunct
food and entertainment chain

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.176
began last year as a series

01:21:28.211 --> 01:21:30.348
of urban legends
started circulating...

01:21:33.752 --> 01:21:35.681
No.

01:21:36.855 --> 01:21:38.116
Please don't.

01:21:38.151 --> 01:21:39.493
Stop!

01:21:42.759 --> 01:21:44.228
Stop. Stop.

01:21:45.599 --> 01:21:47.561
Come on. Where is it?

01:21:49.901 --> 01:21:51.569
Oh. Yeah.

01:22:16.792 --> 01:22:18.559
Oh, no.

01:22:27.134 --> 01:22:29.042
It's not working.

01:22:35.507 --> 01:22:37.349
I have to disable the signal.

01:22:37.384 --> 01:22:39.047
Come on.

01:22:39.082 --> 01:22:41.150
Your mom doesn't care about you.

01:22:41.186 --> 01:22:43.381
-Please, just stop.
-No.

01:22:43.416 --> 01:22:45.459
She only thinks about herself.

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:47.254
Parents are all the same,

01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:49.419
and I have to punish them
for that.

01:22:49.454 --> 01:22:51.625
Please, don't hurt her.

01:22:53.259 --> 01:22:55.268
I'm in. I'm in.

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:56.567
Okay.

01:22:56.603 --> 01:22:58.302
Yes, I'm sure.

01:23:12.749 --> 01:23:14.351
Go, go!

01:23:15.621 --> 01:23:17.249
Go, go, go.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:21.718
Do you need some help?

01:23:21.753 --> 01:23:23.324
You all need to stay
inside tonight.

01:23:23.359 --> 01:23:25.627
-Can they go with you?
-Of course.

01:23:25.663 --> 01:23:29.795
You know, it looks like you
might be needing a good lawyer.

01:23:30.729 --> 01:23:32.536
Mike.

01:23:34.773 --> 01:23:36.036
I got it, Vanessa.

01:23:36.072 --> 01:23:38.540
They're deactivated.

01:23:47.718 --> 01:23:50.015
No.

01:23:50.050 --> 01:23:51.751
No. Wait.

01:23:51.786 --> 01:23:53.988
Vanessa, th-there's one
more dot. It's still moving.

01:23:54.024 --> 01:23:55.619
That's not possible.

01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:58.065
-Where is it?
-It's at my house.

01:23:59.061 --> 01:24:00.392
The Marionette.

01:24:00.428 --> 01:24:01.728
I'm gonna head there right now.

01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:53.945
Mike?

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.317
<i>They're turning back on.</i>

01:24:57.353 --> 01:24:58.882
<i>The signal's been reactivated.</i>

01:24:58.917 --> 01:25:01.227
<i>We're outmatched.</i>
<i>We need more help.</i>

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.426
I've got an idea.

01:25:27.154 --> 01:25:29.420
I don't know
if you can hear me or not.

01:25:31.391 --> 01:25:34.220
I-I don't even know
if you're all still here, but...

01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:36.295
Abby needs you.

01:25:38.392 --> 01:25:40.431
She needs your help now.

01:25:42.263 --> 01:25:43.795
Do you hear me?

01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:47.631
If any of you
ever really cared about her,

01:25:47.666 --> 01:25:49.968
you're gonna help her right now.

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:54.841
Please!

01:25:58.679 --> 01:26:01.353
Please, I...
I can't do this alone.

01:26:07.592 --> 01:26:09.825
Oh, come on, come on.

01:26:09.861 --> 01:26:11.621
Don't die.

01:26:22.543 --> 01:26:24.175
Mike.

01:26:26.715 --> 01:26:28.506
Mike, are you there?

01:26:28.541 --> 01:26:29.807
My radiator's busted.

01:26:29.842 --> 01:26:32.219
I don't know what to do.
I-I can't...

01:26:33.986 --> 01:26:36.150
I can't get to Abby. I...

01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:47.667
-Vanessa?
-Oh, thank God.

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:49.632
Do you need a ride?

01:26:52.665 --> 01:26:54.430
I need to go to Mike's house.

01:26:54.466 --> 01:26:55.704
Right now.

01:27:07.823 --> 01:27:09.949
Vanessa, what is going on?

01:27:12.022 --> 01:27:13.590
Crazy eyes.

01:27:29.434 --> 01:27:31.003
Abby.

01:27:32.407 --> 01:27:34.105
Vanessa.

01:27:39.851 --> 01:27:41.915
Vanessa.

01:27:47.024 --> 01:27:48.652
Charlotte?

01:27:48.687 --> 01:27:50.124
No, silly.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:53.228
It's me, Abby.

01:27:56.236 --> 01:27:57.869
Charlotte, what have you done?

01:28:05.908 --> 01:28:08.705
Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:11.448
Vanessa.

01:28:11.483 --> 01:28:15.021
The adults in your life
betrayed you, too.

01:28:15.057 --> 01:28:17.616
They don't deserve
your protection.

01:28:17.651 --> 01:28:19.956
You don't have to die with them.

01:28:19.992 --> 01:28:21.757
You can help me.

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:26.125
Vanessa.

01:28:26.161 --> 01:28:30.799
You really thought I'd forget
the first rule of hide-and-seek?

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:34.803
Always check behind the door.

01:28:50.782 --> 01:28:52.618
Charlotte, listen to me.

01:28:52.654 --> 01:28:54.761
Abby's innocent.
Just let her go.

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:56.753
You know, Vanessa,

01:28:56.788 --> 01:28:58.495
I've always wondered,

01:28:58.530 --> 01:29:02.297
what exactly goes on
inside of your head?

01:29:09.472 --> 01:29:12.005
No. No.

01:29:28.324 --> 01:29:29.825
Abby.

01:29:30.856 --> 01:29:33.559
-Mike.
-Abby. Hey.

01:29:33.595 --> 01:29:34.792
Are you okay?

01:29:34.827 --> 01:29:36.527
I don't know what happened.

01:29:36.562 --> 01:29:38.703
I feel sick.

01:29:38.738 --> 01:29:42.605
It's like the bag of orange
gummy candies all over again.

01:29:42.641 --> 01:29:44.672
-All right, c-can you stand up?
-I think so.

01:29:44.707 --> 01:29:46.703
-Yeah? Okay.
-Let's get out of here.

01:29:46.738 --> 01:29:48.580
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:29:53.012 --> 01:29:56.486
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:30:02.391 --> 01:30:04.029
No, no.

01:30:08.534 --> 01:30:11.064
Knock, knock.

01:30:14.204 --> 01:30:15.904
Hiya, sis.

01:30:16.909 --> 01:30:18.610
Michael.

01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:21.376
Vanessa, what the hell
is going on?

01:30:21.412 --> 01:30:22.642
Oh, let me guess.

01:30:22.677 --> 01:30:24.508
She never told you about me.

01:30:26.218 --> 01:30:28.179
That's my sister for you.

01:30:28.215 --> 01:30:32.283
She always was a little
selective with the truth.

01:30:33.289 --> 01:30:34.761
I'm Michael.

01:30:34.797 --> 01:30:37.428
Michael Afton.

01:30:37.463 --> 01:30:39.724
I am so pleased
to finally meet you.

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.167
Leave them alone, Michael.

01:30:41.203 --> 01:30:42.766
They haven't done
anything wrong.

01:30:42.801 --> 01:30:45.465
I think our father might
strongly disagree with that.

01:30:45.501 --> 01:30:47.606
Your father's dead.

01:30:49.942 --> 01:30:51.478
Yeah.

01:30:52.775 --> 01:30:55.905
But I'm here
to continue his legacy,

01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:58.485
just in time for Fazfest.

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.449
That was you?

01:31:04.224 --> 01:31:06.284
Well, your aunt was the one

01:31:06.319 --> 01:31:10.057
who rekindled everyone's
interest in Freddy's, but...

01:31:10.093 --> 01:31:13.563
I got to admit,
I did add fuel to the fire.

01:31:13.598 --> 01:31:15.726
It's the perfect cover.

01:31:15.761 --> 01:31:17.930
I mean...

01:31:17.965 --> 01:31:20.565
we're all just
gonna blend right in.

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:28.809
Half of this town
will be dead by morning.

01:31:28.844 --> 01:31:31.608
You can't do this.
This isn't a game.

01:31:31.643 --> 01:31:33.647
Michael.

01:31:33.682 --> 01:31:35.451
You can have a normal life.

01:31:35.486 --> 01:31:38.085
We could have a normal life.

01:31:39.084 --> 01:31:42.122
Vanessa, is that
what you thought?

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:45.763
You thought you could just
trade us in?

01:31:46.764 --> 01:31:49.800
Betray us?
Get yourself a shiny new life?

01:31:51.335 --> 01:31:53.463
You are his child.

01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:57.802
You have a purpose.

01:31:59.212 --> 01:32:03.178
We will always be his.

01:32:03.214 --> 01:32:05.211
Come home.

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:10.284
I am home.

01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:19.698
Hmm.

01:32:23.963 --> 01:32:25.869
Doesn't matter to me anyway.

01:32:27.075 --> 01:32:29.499
Yeah. Break their bones.

01:32:30.574 --> 01:32:32.642
Crush them.

01:32:32.677 --> 01:32:35.241
It's okay.

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:18.418
Freddy?

01:33:41.912 --> 01:33:46.444
Abby, you've been
a very, very bad girl.

01:34:10.776 --> 01:34:13.438
Where do you think
you're going, jackass?

01:34:24.985 --> 01:34:27.254
Chica.

01:34:29.621 --> 01:34:32.660
Oh. What's wrong with them?

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:43.400
Their systems, they're...
they're failing.

01:34:50.815 --> 01:34:53.547
They weren't made
to leave Freddy's.

01:34:53.583 --> 01:34:55.546
They're dying?

01:34:56.652 --> 01:34:59.424
No, you can't die.

01:34:59.459 --> 01:35:01.651
We're just moving on.

01:35:03.762 --> 01:35:06.865
We can't stay
in those bodies anymore.

01:35:11.239 --> 01:35:13.168
Are you going to heaven?

01:35:15.067 --> 01:35:16.974
See you there someday?

01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:19.669
But not too soon.

01:35:20.641 --> 01:35:22.311
Mike?

01:35:22.346 --> 01:35:23.615
Yeah?

01:35:23.650 --> 01:35:25.510
You should know that
when we leave...

01:35:26.686 --> 01:35:28.980
...I won't be able
to hold him anymore.

01:35:29.015 --> 01:35:31.315
He'll get out eventually,

01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:33.222
and he'll be stronger
than before.

01:35:33.258 --> 01:35:35.195
Who?

01:35:48.141 --> 01:35:50.205
Goodbye.

01:35:54.414 --> 01:35:55.881
Hey.

01:36:02.883 --> 01:36:03.990
Mike?

01:36:04.025 --> 01:36:05.517
Whoa.

01:36:07.393 --> 01:36:09.554
Everyone okay?

01:36:11.357 --> 01:36:13.428
Yeah, um... Hey, we got to go.

01:36:13.463 --> 01:36:15.024
Okay.

01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.067
Come on, Abby.

01:36:18.767 --> 01:36:20.807
Stay away from us.

01:36:21.801 --> 01:36:23.007
What?

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:26.936
I can't trust you.

01:36:26.971 --> 01:36:28.214
Mike.

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:29.915
Just stay away.

Why do we have to do this
in the rain?

01:39:09.539 --> 01:39:11.373
Because this whole place is
getting demolished tomorrow.

01:39:11.409 --> 01:39:13.606
We got to grab everything
we can while it's still here.

01:39:13.642 --> 01:39:16.177
Why couldn't we just make
the props for the haunted house?

01:39:16.213 --> 01:39:18.212
Come on, they want
the authentic thing.

a little bit of nostalgia.

Ethan, where are you?

01:39:32.326 --> 01:39:34.064
Back here!

01:39:34.099 --> 01:39:37.002
Dude, I-I think I just found
another room.

01:39:37.038 --> 01:39:39.230
I'm not joking-- I think
I just found another room.

01:39:39.265 --> 01:39:41.697
Get back here right now!

01:39:41.733 --> 01:39:43.603
-Yes, Ethan!
-Okay, okay, okay.

01:39:45.274 --> 01:39:47.778

01:40:04.262 --> 01:40:05.997
-Hey, uh, Patrick, cover it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:06.032 --> 01:40:07.632
Let's get the dolly.
Cover it, will you?

01:40:07.667 --> 01:40:08.994
