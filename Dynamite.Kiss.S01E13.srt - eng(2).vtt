DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:55.410
Gosh, I don't like the sight of that.
Put that thing down already.

00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:57.996
I can't. I'm testing the prototype.

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:00.790
But you're taking it too far.

00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:04.377
Earlier, the supermarket lady whispered
to me and asked if you had a baby.

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.213
How nice would it be
if it really were your grandchild?

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:08.631
Maybe in a million years.

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:10.466
Even marriage is shooting for the stars.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.135
Not at all, we--

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:14.429
-What's wrong with you?
-What?

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:17.098
-Yes?
-What was that for?

00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:22.270
I have something to tell you.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.231
You see,

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.150
I love Da-rim very much.

00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:28.693
Oh my.

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:35.783
I'd like to marry her.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:39.162
I want to become your son-in-law.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.831
My son-in-law?

00:01:45.627 --> 00:01:48.004
What wonderful news!

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:50.882
I couldn't have asked
for a better moving-away present.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.594
Don't they make such a good couple?

00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:56.679
Right.

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:58.765
Well, they do, but…

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.851
Let's all eat this first.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:04.270
You can relax.

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:10.235
I think your mother

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:12.737
might not be too fond of me.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.738
Come on.

00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:15.949
She was just caught off guard.

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:18.534
It looked like she was
completely charmed by you.

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:21.037
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:25.416
My mom likes handsome guys too.

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:35.969
Having it all out in the open

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:37.971
feels nice.

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:39.389
Yeah.

00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:41.933
Once the baby carrier is released,

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.560
everything will come to a nice close.

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:06.833
DYNAMITE KISS

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.460
It's finally here.

00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.422
Natural BeBe's first baby carrier.

00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:16.217
That's right,
it's the baby carrier we created.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.387
This is exactly how I felt
when I gave birth to my first son.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.304
My goodness.

00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:23.641
You know the feeling, right?

00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:26.019
This will be out on the market
next week, right?

00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:27.145
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:03:29.564 --> 00:03:30.857
Now, now.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.525
You all worked really hard.

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:34.736
I'm sure we'll see positive results.

00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:36.696
Mr. Gong!

00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:39.907
Mr. Gong! You all need to look at this.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.826
This came out so nicely.

00:03:42.368 --> 00:03:43.453
Look at it.

00:03:45.955 --> 00:03:48.166
This is the same as our prototype.

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:50.626
We never placed an order for this color.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.255
This is a new product
that MomsJoy released this morning.

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.090
What?

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:00.845
Who's Go Da-rim?

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:03.431
I'm Go Da-rim.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:06.642
You're Go Da-rim?

00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:10.271
Oh my!

00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:22.408
What do you think you're doing?

00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:25.536
You dare set foot in my company?

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.537
Get her out of here.

00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:30.458
Oh my goodness.

00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:34.045
You fool. Do you still not get it?

00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:35.713
Who do you think leaked that?

00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:37.215
Go Da-rim is a spy!

00:04:50.144 --> 00:04:53.940
There's a record of this email
being sent to MomsJoy from your computer.

00:04:54.023 --> 00:04:55.233
Will you still deny it?

00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:57.777
This must be an error.

00:04:58.403 --> 00:04:59.278
Either that

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:02.240
or someone secretly used my computer.

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:08.121
I can confidently say

00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:12.125
that I put my heart and soul
into developing this new product.

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:14.419
So why would I just give that away?

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:16.421
Then can you explain this?

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:24.929
You even had a resignation letter
prepared in advance.

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:28.266
You got this job as a corporate spy
in the first place, didn't you?

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:31.644
Were you looking to score big and bail?

00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:34.856
That's not what happened.
What do you take me for?

00:05:37.483 --> 00:05:39.777
You were the one
who lied about being married

00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:42.029
and committed fraud to get the job.

00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:46.909
So you knew she lied to get hired
and let it slide?

00:05:46.993 --> 00:05:47.827
Yes.

00:05:49.537 --> 00:05:51.205
So I'll take responsibility for that.

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:54.041
But

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:57.170
framing her for being a spy
when she didn't do anything?

00:05:57.253 --> 00:05:58.671
That's absolutely unacceptable.

00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:00.923
Do you know how much we lost
from this new product leak?

00:06:01.591 --> 00:06:03.968
This isn't the time for coddling.
What are you thinking?

00:06:04.051 --> 00:06:04.886
Father.

00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:07.597
I doubt Ji-hyeok

00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:10.057
can think rationally right now.

00:06:11.434 --> 00:06:14.979
I've received these photos
from an anonymous sender.

00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:23.070
It appears

00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:26.324
Ms. Go didn't just steal
our trade secrets,

00:06:26.407 --> 00:06:28.367
but also Ji-hyeok's heart.

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:33.831
You idiot.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.628
Fire Go Da-rim, and cover this up.

00:06:39.212 --> 00:06:41.380
That seems to be the only way out.

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:42.298
No.

00:06:43.424 --> 00:06:44.300
I can't let you do that.

00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:47.803
I love that woman.

00:06:48.638 --> 00:06:49.472
Love?

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:53.142
Ji-hyeok.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.686
This is

00:06:56.938 --> 00:06:58.606
a crucial moment in your life.

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:00.358
You're just going to give up

00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:02.902
on being promoted to vice president
and our joint venture with Taeyu C&T?

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:04.487
All because of a woman like her?

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.865
Emotions like that are fleeting.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:10.826
Money, power, and companies
are what last to be passed down.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.453
Think wisely!

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:16.666
I'll handle the investigation.

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:27.969
-Is that her?
-Yeah.

00:07:28.052 --> 00:07:29.178
-It is her, right?
-That's her?

00:07:29.262 --> 00:07:30.388
Yes, that's her.

00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:32.515
She lied to get her position
on the Mother TF Team.

00:07:32.598 --> 00:07:34.642
-What a fraud.
-How shameless.

00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:36.310
I heard she's even spying on us.

00:07:36.394 --> 00:07:38.062
-How shameless.
-The absolute nerve.

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:40.189
-She seduced the team leader.
-Look. It's her.

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:42.024
Why does she live like that?

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.447
You shouldn't be doing this.

00:08:29.947 --> 00:08:31.616
People are staring.

00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:33.576
I don't care.

00:08:42.335 --> 00:08:43.336
I'm sorry.

00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:46.964
Why would you be sorry?

00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:49.050
What did the auditor say?

00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:52.887
You must've been scared all alone.

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:56.932
I felt so wronged,

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.477
but there was nothing I could say.

00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:03.064
If I were him, I'd think I was guilty too.

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:06.817
They said I should stop working

00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:08.903
and go home for now.

00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:14.909
Don't worry too much.

00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:17.370
I'll do whatever it takes

00:09:17.995 --> 00:09:19.080
and take care of it all.

00:09:37.473 --> 00:09:39.350
Well, I was right, wasn't I?

00:09:39.433 --> 00:09:40.267
Yeah.

00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:43.270
It totally played out the way we expected.

00:09:43.354 --> 00:09:45.940
This is so thrilling!

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.193
Don't get too excited.

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.820
The climax has yet to come.

00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:53.072
The climax?

00:10:00.663 --> 00:10:01.622
You worked hard.

00:10:02.998 --> 00:10:04.041
Go Da-rim

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:06.836
and then, Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:21.517
Ms. Go.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:26.313
Can we

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:28.691
talk for a moment?

00:10:36.115 --> 00:10:38.117
I think we should prioritize
restoring the art hall's image

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.285
that was damaged by the fire.

00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:40.286
Sure, go ahead.

00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:42.955
We're thinking of "a new beginning"
as the theme for the next exhibition--

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:44.248
Sure, go ahead.

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:46.292
Ms. Yu.

00:10:47.376 --> 00:10:49.128
-Ms. Yu?
-Go ahead.

00:10:52.798 --> 00:10:53.632
Yes?

00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:55.634
You seem very tired.

00:10:57.428 --> 00:10:59.138
I'm fine. Please continue.

00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:00.055
Well…

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:02.767
How would you like us to proceed?

00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:09.523
-Did you have fun today?
-Yes.

00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:11.525
-What'd you do?
-We drew pictures.

00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:14.445
But…

00:11:16.238 --> 00:11:18.115
Did he already go home? Jeez.

00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:19.575
Ms. Han?

00:11:19.658 --> 00:11:21.327
She looks like the pretty lady.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.745
That's her mother.

00:11:22.828 --> 00:11:24.038
Really?

00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:25.581
Wait, Jun!

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.958
Hello.

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:29.627
My name is Kim Jun.

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:37.593
Oh, I see.

00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:38.511
Hello.

00:11:38.594 --> 00:11:40.679
I hear you're the pretty lady's mom.

00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:41.764
"Pretty lady"?

00:11:41.847 --> 00:11:43.766
I'm best friends with her.

00:11:44.683 --> 00:11:46.060
Is that so?

00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:50.564
What are you doing?

00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:51.982
What…

00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:53.859
Can you give this to her?

00:11:54.485 --> 00:11:55.319
This?

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.824
This too.

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:03.077
MILK

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.537
This too?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.206
And make sure to tell her it's from Jun.

00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:08.165
I'm sorry.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.085
Kim Jun, I told you to stop doing this.

00:12:11.168 --> 00:12:12.586
She isn't coming back.

00:12:13.295 --> 00:12:14.463
Okay.

00:12:14.964 --> 00:12:16.674
Why are you scolding the child?

00:12:16.757 --> 00:12:20.844
He says he's best friends with Ha-yeong,
so why can't he give her a gift?

00:12:25.307 --> 00:12:26.809
What am I even doing here?

00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:27.851
My goodness.

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:29.895
Goodness gracious.

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:32.106
But what brings you here?

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:34.650
Well…

00:12:35.859 --> 00:12:37.111
I came to see some land.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.613
It's just a hobby.

00:12:39.697 --> 00:12:42.658
Since we ran into each other,
how about a cup of tea?

00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:44.034
I'm hungry.

00:12:44.118 --> 00:12:45.119
You are?

00:12:45.703 --> 00:12:47.288
What do you want to eat?

00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:49.164
All right, let's eat.

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:53.877
The adult should have a bite first.

00:12:53.961 --> 00:12:54.837
Here you go.

00:13:02.219 --> 00:13:03.178
All right.

00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:06.348
Thanks.

00:13:06.932 --> 00:13:07.808
Good job.

00:13:08.684 --> 00:13:10.436
Please feel free to have some
if you haven't eaten yet.

00:13:11.103 --> 00:13:13.230
Go on and eat.

00:13:15.482 --> 00:13:16.650
What's wrong?

00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:17.693
There's bread left.

00:13:20.446 --> 00:13:21.447
Have some of this too.

00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:23.866
-Chew thoroughly and eat slowly.
-Okay.

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:27.536
There are sausages, tomatoes,
and quail eggs.

00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:39.798
Mr. Kim.

00:13:39.882 --> 00:13:43.135
Are you aware
that Ha-yeong has feelings for you?

00:13:43.802 --> 00:13:44.970
You don't need to worry.

00:13:45.804 --> 00:13:49.016
I can assure you
that Ms. Yu and I will never date.

00:13:52.144 --> 00:13:54.980
Well, life is full of surprises.

00:13:55.064 --> 00:13:56.357
No.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.735
I made sure to make that clear to Ms. Yu,
so you don't need to worry.

00:14:00.653 --> 00:14:02.321
So that's why she's such a mess right now.

00:14:03.447 --> 00:14:04.448
Hold on.

00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:07.076
You keep telling me not to worry.

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:09.078
Who's worried here?

00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:10.829
You think I'm worried?

00:14:10.913 --> 00:14:13.415
I didn't want to
make you worry needlessly.

00:14:13.499 --> 00:14:14.333
Well, you're right about that.

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:16.210
I am worried.

00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:18.420
Mr. Kim,

00:14:18.504 --> 00:14:20.172
you can't be so narrow-minded

00:14:20.255 --> 00:14:22.216
if you want to survive
in this cruel world.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.969
You need to be open-minded.
Ever heard of it?

00:14:26.011 --> 00:14:28.263
-Pardon?
-You're still young.

00:14:28.347 --> 00:14:32.267
You need to open your heart up
and date all sorts of people.

00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:34.520
Why don't you like Ha-yeong?

00:14:35.354 --> 00:14:38.816
Well, I didn't mean
that I particularly disliked her…

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:41.610
By any chance,

00:14:42.736 --> 00:14:43.988
do you dislike chaebol families?

00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:45.155
Do you not like money?

00:14:45.239 --> 00:14:47.950
Are you repulsed by the idea of a woman
buying you a house and a car,

00:14:48.033 --> 00:14:50.035
and paying for trips abroad every season?

00:14:50.119 --> 00:14:54.123
Does the idea of living in a great house
while never worrying about money

00:14:54.206 --> 00:14:56.917
just make your skin crawl?

00:14:58.669 --> 00:15:00.379
-Ms. Han.
-Yes?

00:15:00.462 --> 00:15:01.422
I know Ha-yeong

00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:04.008
has a pure heart with a kind soul.

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:06.051
That's why.

00:15:06.135 --> 00:15:07.094
I mean…

00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:09.763
That's more reason

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.019
for her to find someone who can
truly love her more than I ever can.

00:15:17.229 --> 00:15:20.149
I'm not ready
to let someone into my life just yet.

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:25.988
I'm sorry.

00:15:47.885 --> 00:15:49.011
Ji-hyeok.

00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:51.180
I checked with security,

00:15:51.263 --> 00:15:53.223
and the day the email was sent
from Da-rim's computer--

00:15:53.307 --> 00:15:54.600
The security cameras were down, huh?

00:15:55.142 --> 00:15:56.518
How'd you know?

00:15:56.602 --> 00:15:57.978
What about the recipient's email account?

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:00.064
Here.

00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:03.025
But the thing is,

00:16:03.609 --> 00:16:05.694
the account has already been deleted.

00:16:09.073 --> 00:16:11.492
Okay. First, have the investigation agency

00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:14.203
search for social media accounts
with similar usernames

00:16:14.286 --> 00:16:15.954
that belong to Koreans aged 30 or older,

00:16:16.038 --> 00:16:19.083
who have been photographed
near MomsJoy's registered address.

00:16:19.166 --> 00:16:20.542
Got it. Koreans aged 30 or older.

00:16:20.626 --> 00:16:23.212
Have them gather all posts tagged
"MomsJoy" and cross-check them

00:16:23.295 --> 00:16:24.755
with the compiled list of usernames.

00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:28.675
Also, have them check
all the accounts that commented

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:29.843
on MomsJoy's official accounts.

00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:31.428
I'll have them start immediately.

00:16:40.187 --> 00:16:42.397
GONG JI-HYE, YU TAE-YEONG

00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:47.820
Just wait and see.

00:16:50.072 --> 00:16:52.074
I'll expose you all,

00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:55.410
even if I have to go
to the ends of the earth.

00:17:00.207 --> 00:17:02.543
How much longer are you going to hold out?

00:17:03.168 --> 00:17:04.378
Ms. Go Da-rim!

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.133
That's enough.

00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:13.637
We're investigating internally
to uncover the truth.

00:17:14.888 --> 00:17:16.682
Let's postpone the interview
for a few days.

00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:18.976
You're looking to uncover the truth?

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.061
She was employed through fake credentials

00:17:21.145 --> 00:17:24.231
and even secretly dated
her immediate supervisor.

00:17:24.314 --> 00:17:26.900
Are there more truths
that need to be uncovered?

00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:28.569
Ms. Go Da-rim.

00:17:29.278 --> 00:17:32.906
Just confess to it now,
and stop making everyone's life hard.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.075
That has nothing to do with the leak.

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:36.577
You can't accuse her like this
based on one email--

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.579
He's right.

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:41.915
I did it.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.965
I was the one who leaked the new product

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:51.925
to a competitor.

00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:54.970
-Da-rim.
-I did it alone.

00:17:55.554 --> 00:17:57.556
Mr. Gong and the team members
knew nothing about it.

00:17:57.639 --> 00:17:59.308
What are you saying right now?

00:17:59.391 --> 00:18:00.893
Can we have a moment to talk alone?

00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:02.019
No.

00:18:02.102 --> 00:18:03.270
I'd rather speak to you alone

00:18:04.271 --> 00:18:05.814
without Mr. Gong present.

00:18:06.607 --> 00:18:09.151
She wants to speak to me alone.

00:18:10.277 --> 00:18:11.403
Follow me.

00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:34.760
Of course, I believe you.

00:18:36.136 --> 00:18:39.431
I know how hard you've worked until now.

00:18:40.182 --> 00:18:42.267
Ji-hyeok also told me
about how you had no choice

00:18:42.351 --> 00:18:43.727
but to lie about your identity.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.938
It must've been so tough.

00:18:46.897 --> 00:18:48.023
I appreciate it.

00:18:48.106 --> 00:18:49.274
But what can we do?

00:18:49.858 --> 00:18:52.527
All the evidence just happens
to point to you as the culprit.

00:18:53.487 --> 00:18:56.323
I know very well
what kind of person you are,

00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:57.699
but the shareholders don't.

00:18:58.909 --> 00:19:00.327
The shareholders?

00:19:01.745 --> 00:19:03.497
There will be
a shareholders' meeting soon.

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:05.415
The original plan

00:19:05.499 --> 00:19:08.001
was to have Ji-hyeok be promoted
to vice president then.

00:19:08.794 --> 00:19:10.837
It's basically a successor announcement.

00:19:13.548 --> 00:19:15.759
It's unfortunate that something like this
had to happen

00:19:16.551 --> 00:19:17.636
at such a crucial moment.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.597
Could Mr. Gong
be negatively affected by this?

00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:22.057
Very much so.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.894
As the successor, he must be
the most impartial and level-headed.

00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:29.648
But he knowingly overlooked
a team member's fraudulent hiring.

00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:32.651
He covered for a corporate spy
out of personal feelings.

00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:33.944
Or…

00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:37.572
did the two of them conspire
to leak company secrets?

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:40.534
Forget vice president.

00:19:40.617 --> 00:19:43.036
He'd be immediately dismissed
from his current position.

00:19:43.954 --> 00:19:45.205
I'm really sorry,

00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:47.708
but you're the only one who can stop this.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.918
How can I stop it?

00:19:50.002 --> 00:19:50.836
You just need to

00:19:51.962 --> 00:19:54.256
take the fall for everything.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.093
Are you suggesting

00:19:59.094 --> 00:20:01.513
I make a false confession?

00:20:02.097 --> 00:20:04.266
-Even so, that seems a bit--
-Think about it.

00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:05.559
If the investigation drags on,

00:20:05.642 --> 00:20:08.687
Ji-hyeok would escalate things
just to protect you.

00:20:09.396 --> 00:20:13.442
His reputation in the industry
will plummet the more he keeps doing that.

00:20:13.525 --> 00:20:15.777
Even if he goes back to consulting,

00:20:16.486 --> 00:20:19.114
who would hire someone
fired by his own father's company

00:20:19.197 --> 00:20:20.782
for corruption?

00:20:23.535 --> 00:20:24.578
Not to mention,

00:20:25.871 --> 00:20:28.457
if you deny it until the end,

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.959
knowing the chairman's personality,

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:35.088
he'll tear apart the Mother TF Team.

00:20:35.714 --> 00:20:37.257
Even if there's no evidence,

00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:39.551
suspicion alone is enough for him
to fire the whole team.

00:20:39.634 --> 00:20:41.636
They're just interns
at the end of the day.

00:20:43.055 --> 00:20:44.306
Why would he go after the team?

00:20:44.973 --> 00:20:47.976
They all worked really hard
in hopes of becoming full-time.

00:20:48.727 --> 00:20:49.686
Exactly.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.230
You're leaving soon anyway.

00:20:53.273 --> 00:20:55.817
For the sake of Ji-hyeok
and the rest of the team members,

00:20:57.527 --> 00:20:58.445
could you

00:20:59.738 --> 00:21:01.114
help them out a little?

00:21:15.837 --> 00:21:17.089
Ms. Go.

00:21:17.172 --> 00:21:18.590
You just need to review this

00:21:19.466 --> 00:21:21.426
and sign at the bottom.

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:25.847
We wrote down exactly what you said.

00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:29.351
2. FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES
3. ADMISSION AND REFLECTION

00:21:33.021 --> 00:21:36.316
STATEMENT BY: GO DA-RIM

00:21:38.693 --> 00:21:39.903
You made the right choice.

00:21:49.913 --> 00:21:52.707
Is Da-rim still being questioned?

00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:55.001
I hope she'll be okay.

00:21:55.085 --> 00:21:56.962
Of course, she'll be fine.

00:21:57.546 --> 00:22:01.049
She did make a mistake,
but to call her a spy…

00:22:01.633 --> 00:22:02.759
That's nonsense.

00:22:02.843 --> 00:22:04.219
Damn it.

00:22:04.302 --> 00:22:06.638
The chairman just slapped her
out of nowhere.

00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:10.100
As soon as her innocence is proven,

00:22:10.183 --> 00:22:11.726
I'll go to that chairman or whatever

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.895
and give him a piece of my mind.

00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:16.898
Seriously, what are we going to do

00:22:16.982 --> 00:22:18.984
with our stay-at-home moms?

00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:22.195
She was clearly a spy.

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:26.324
You coddled her
without knowing who she really was.

00:22:26.408 --> 00:22:28.410
Serves you right.

00:22:28.493 --> 00:22:31.288
Who are you calling a spy?
Da-rim would never do such a thing!

00:22:33.123 --> 00:22:35.959
Goodness me, that's why
you were stabbed in the back.

00:22:36.042 --> 00:22:39.379
Anyway, just know that the company
took a major blow because of her.

00:22:39.462 --> 00:22:41.464
You all need to take responsibility
for this too!

00:22:45.552 --> 00:22:46.761
Responsibility?

00:22:46.845 --> 00:22:47.888
We'll take responsibility.

00:22:47.971 --> 00:22:49.389
But what if she's innocent?

00:22:49.472 --> 00:22:51.683
If she is, will you take responsibility?

00:22:52.267 --> 00:22:53.185
What did you say?

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.478
Sure, I'll take responsibility.

00:22:55.562 --> 00:22:59.024
How dare an intern
glare at a team leader like that?

00:22:59.107 --> 00:23:00.358
Glaring?

00:23:00.442 --> 00:23:02.110
My eyes are just naturally like this.

00:23:02.194 --> 00:23:04.863
-Yes, her eyes are always like that.
-That's right.

00:23:04.946 --> 00:23:07.032
-You're insulting her appearance.
-What?

00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:09.117
-Yeah.
-That's sexual harassment!

00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:10.827
-Yeah!
-Sexual harassment!

00:23:10.911 --> 00:23:12.287
-Fine.
-Unbelievable.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.955
-Let's end this today!
-What's wrong with you?

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.125
-You should watch what you say!
-No way.

00:23:17.209 --> 00:23:18.460
Go Da-rim confessed.

00:23:19.044 --> 00:23:19.920
What was that?

00:23:26.885 --> 00:23:27.844
Mom.

00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:29.221
Hey, Ha-yeong.

00:23:31.598 --> 00:23:32.849
What are you up to?

00:23:32.933 --> 00:23:34.392
I was just sitting here. Why?

00:23:34.476 --> 00:23:35.310
Listen.

00:23:36.686 --> 00:23:37.938
I want to go to the US.

00:23:38.021 --> 00:23:40.857
Sure. A trip might do you some good.

00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:42.317
No.

00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:44.736
I want to study abroad.

00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:46.696
I want to get that degree I never got.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.115
I'll get married later.

00:23:49.699 --> 00:23:51.368
Then what about Mr. Kim?

00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:52.786
You're giving up?

00:23:54.746 --> 00:23:57.249
He seemed like a good guy
when I talked to him.

00:23:58.166 --> 00:23:59.501
You met with him?

00:23:59.584 --> 00:24:02.379
What now?
How did you harass him this time?

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.215
I didn't harass him.

00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:07.300
You were sulking around all day,

00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:10.595
so I just went to see him to find out
if something had happened between you two.

00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:12.055
Why would you do that?

00:24:15.684 --> 00:24:16.518
Forget it.

00:24:17.352 --> 00:24:20.855
Pursuing him when he doesn't like me
will only make his life harder.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.275
I'm leaving

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:25.860
to forget about Mr. Kim.

00:24:26.736 --> 00:24:28.905
I'll get ready to go back to school.

00:24:34.786 --> 00:24:35.954
But…

00:24:39.708 --> 00:24:40.750
you should take this with you.

00:24:41.626 --> 00:24:42.585
He wanted you to have it.

00:24:45.964 --> 00:24:46.965
This too.

00:24:47.048 --> 00:24:48.008
MILK

00:25:04.357 --> 00:25:05.317
Jun.

00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:07.235
Did you know?

00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:10.864
I had more fun

00:25:10.947 --> 00:25:13.950
at your talent show
than I've ever had at any party.

00:25:31.926 --> 00:25:34.471
I've never liked Gong Ji-hyeok
from the start.

00:25:35.096 --> 00:25:36.723
He just came out of nowhere

00:25:36.806 --> 00:25:38.683
with that useless CSR initiative
and tree planting nonsense.

00:25:39.768 --> 00:25:41.102
You're right.

00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:46.232
It was a project
Executive Director Kim In-ae used to lead.

00:25:46.316 --> 00:25:50.070
So if Mr. Gong becomes the successor,

00:25:50.153 --> 00:25:51.112
he's bound to

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.200
bring back her people, no?

00:25:56.576 --> 00:25:58.370
Then what does that mean for us?

00:25:58.453 --> 00:26:00.330
Ji-hyeok's biggest supporter

00:26:00.914 --> 00:26:02.707
is none other than Chairman Gong.

00:26:02.791 --> 00:26:04.542
As long as he's in power,

00:26:05.126 --> 00:26:07.170
Ji-hyeok will do
what he must to get rid of me

00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:10.507
and all of you as well.

00:26:12.092 --> 00:26:14.469
What? He's going to clean house?

00:26:14.969 --> 00:26:17.097
Who does he think grew this company
to what it is now?

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.306
Absolutely.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.309
This is just pure nonsense.

00:26:21.393 --> 00:26:25.730
Then should we strike first
before he gets a chance to attack us?

00:26:25.814 --> 00:26:27.232
After all,

00:26:27.315 --> 00:26:30.568
the shareholders' meeting
is right around the corner.

00:26:30.652 --> 00:26:31.778
How about we bring forth

00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:35.615
a motion to dismiss the chairman then?

00:26:35.698 --> 00:26:38.368
-A motion to dismiss him?
-Dismissal? Is that even possible?

00:26:38.451 --> 00:26:40.912
-That might be pushing it.
-Right?

00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:43.123
For such a motion to pass,

00:26:43.206 --> 00:26:45.542
you'd need the approval
of at least two-thirds

00:26:45.625 --> 00:26:47.168
of the shareholders present at the meeting

00:26:47.252 --> 00:26:49.295
and at least one-third
of the total issued shares.

00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:52.841
You have more than enough here to pass
the attending shareholder vote,

00:26:52.924 --> 00:26:55.844
but securing one-third
of the total shares will be a challenge.

00:26:55.927 --> 00:26:57.470
The recent paid-in capital increase

00:26:57.554 --> 00:27:00.640
led to more foreign investors
and minor shareholders.

00:27:00.723 --> 00:27:02.934
Getting them on board won't be easy.

00:27:05.854 --> 00:27:06.855
My goodness.

00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:08.481
Hello.

00:27:15.363 --> 00:27:16.906
You all seem rather concerned.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.290
Please allow me to explain that to you.

00:27:32.547 --> 00:27:36.843
You will be redirected to voicemail,
and charges will apply after the beep.

00:27:36.926 --> 00:27:37.886
She's not picking up, is she?

00:27:40.305 --> 00:27:41.598
Her phone's turned off.

00:27:41.681 --> 00:27:47.061
I mean, she should loop us in
so we can protect her or fight for her.

00:27:47.145 --> 00:27:49.022
She must have her reasons.

00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:50.607
Should we just go to her place?

00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:52.817
Her address should be
in her personnel file.

00:27:52.901 --> 00:27:53.735
I'll go with you.

00:27:53.818 --> 00:27:56.112
-Me too.
-No, just give her some space.

00:27:56.196 --> 00:27:59.949
If a visit were to solve all this,
she would've already told us everything.

00:28:00.033 --> 00:28:01.367
She just needs time.

00:28:15.423 --> 00:28:16.257
Da-rim.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.344
Mr. Gong… I mean, Ji-hyeok's here.

00:28:20.261 --> 00:28:21.304
Don't let him in.

00:28:28.102 --> 00:28:29.145
That's right.

00:28:29.729 --> 00:28:30.647
I did it.

00:28:31.689 --> 00:28:34.317
I had to quit after this project,

00:28:35.068 --> 00:28:37.403
but I didn't get a single callback
from any company.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.031
And their terms weren't bad.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.743
They offered a lot of money and a job.

00:28:44.702 --> 00:28:45.537
You're lying.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.913
I'm not lying.

00:28:47.497 --> 00:28:48.498
I really did it.

00:28:48.581 --> 00:28:51.084
You'd never do such a thing.

00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:52.710
Did you forget who I was?

00:28:52.794 --> 00:28:54.838
I didn't hesitate to lie about being a mom

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.757
just to get a job and make money.

00:28:57.841 --> 00:28:58.675
No.

00:28:59.759 --> 00:29:01.219
The Da-rim I know…

00:29:03.555 --> 00:29:05.139
would stop arguing on the street

00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:08.977
to help a stranger pick up tangerines
off the ground

00:29:09.894 --> 00:29:12.188
and gladly throw herself to save the child

00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:14.399
of someone who harassed her.

00:29:16.776 --> 00:29:18.361
She'd jump into a pool

00:29:18.444 --> 00:29:20.738
to save her teammates' jobs
when she can't even swim.

00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:23.908
She even jumped into a fire to save me.

00:29:26.494 --> 00:29:28.580
So how am I supposed to believe that?

00:29:32.792 --> 00:29:34.377
If you're doing this for my sake,

00:29:35.295 --> 00:29:36.504
you don't need to.

00:29:37.755 --> 00:29:39.132
As long as I have you--

00:29:39.215 --> 00:29:40.300
Let's…

00:29:41.467 --> 00:29:42.677
break up.

00:29:50.643 --> 00:29:51.603
Don't do this.

00:29:53.229 --> 00:29:54.731
You have me.

00:29:57.358 --> 00:29:59.193
Why do you insist on suffering alone?

00:29:59.277 --> 00:30:00.486
Just trust me and--

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.405
I'm suffering because of you.

00:30:03.615 --> 00:30:04.949
Do you not get it?

00:30:05.033 --> 00:30:05.867
Listen.

00:30:06.659 --> 00:30:08.369
If it weren't for you,

00:30:08.453 --> 00:30:10.788
I would've lived a quiet, uneventful life.

00:30:11.372 --> 00:30:13.583
But because I got involved with you,

00:30:13.666 --> 00:30:15.168
I was constantly anxious
and had to walk on eggshells,

00:30:15.752 --> 00:30:18.212
and now, everyone knows
I lied to get that job.

00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:20.840
I know.

00:30:20.924 --> 00:30:22.216
I brought this on myself.

00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:26.346
I'm getting punished for acting out
without knowing my place.

00:30:27.513 --> 00:30:30.433
But having to show myself in this state

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.894
to you and the rest of the team

00:30:33.561 --> 00:30:35.688
is so degrading and humiliating.

00:30:36.314 --> 00:30:38.399
That's what I find even more unbearable.

00:30:40.735 --> 00:30:41.694
So…

00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:45.114
let's just end things here.

00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:48.368
Let's each go back to where we belong.

00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:51.496
Da-rim.

00:30:54.332 --> 00:30:55.249
This is me…

00:30:56.876 --> 00:30:58.086
at rock bottom.

00:31:46.426 --> 00:31:47.427
Da-rim.

00:31:49.429 --> 00:31:51.389
Wake up, Da-rim.

00:31:52.724 --> 00:31:56.310
What are you doing?
You should be getting ready for work.

00:31:56.394 --> 00:31:59.147
Wake up, my little princess.

00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.946
Mom.

00:32:11.951 --> 00:32:13.453
What were you thinking?

00:32:13.536 --> 00:32:14.704
How could you do that?

00:32:17.248 --> 00:32:19.083
I didn't have any other option.

00:32:20.043 --> 00:32:23.004
The bank said they'd take the house
if I didn't pay back the loan.

00:32:23.588 --> 00:32:26.591
I had to pay the hospital bills
and Da-jeong's private loan.

00:32:27.383 --> 00:32:29.969
Part-time jobs wouldn't have covered them.

00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:32.513
I know it was wrong…

00:32:35.308 --> 00:32:36.642
but I had no other choice.

00:32:36.726 --> 00:32:38.519
Even so.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.358
How could you lie
about something like that for a job?

00:32:51.324 --> 00:32:52.950
What did Mr. Gong say?

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.162
I told him we should break up.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.873
He knew I lied

00:32:59.582 --> 00:33:01.876
and still covered for me,

00:33:01.959 --> 00:33:03.878
and now he's in a tight spot.

00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:11.469
Mom.

00:33:11.552 --> 00:33:13.054
You don't need to worry.

00:33:13.137 --> 00:33:15.223
I'll pull myself together

00:33:15.306 --> 00:33:17.183
and find a job.

00:33:17.683 --> 00:33:20.895
You just focus on staying healthy, okay?

00:33:21.687 --> 00:33:22.772
Let's sell the house.

00:33:25.942 --> 00:33:28.111
Sell this house and pay off the debt.

00:33:29.237 --> 00:33:30.113
Mom.

00:33:31.572 --> 00:33:33.533
What are you talking about?

00:33:34.867 --> 00:33:37.036
Even if we sell this house,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.831
we'll have nothing left
after we pay back Seon-u's deposit.

00:33:41.457 --> 00:33:42.708
And this house

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:44.961
isn't something we can just sell off.

00:33:46.129 --> 00:33:49.423
It's filled with the memories Dad left us.

00:33:49.924 --> 00:33:51.384
Who cares about any of that?

00:33:52.426 --> 00:33:53.469
I didn't even know

00:33:54.178 --> 00:33:55.805
you were living through that hell.

00:33:57.265 --> 00:34:02.770
You must have suffered so much,
having to carry all that burden alone.

00:34:07.358 --> 00:34:08.276
I'm…

00:34:09.819 --> 00:34:11.320
really sorry.

00:34:15.032 --> 00:34:17.076
I'm sure your dad
would want us to do the same.

00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:20.955
Mom.

00:34:23.124 --> 00:34:24.041
It's settled.

00:34:25.835 --> 00:34:27.003
Let's take care of everything

00:34:27.712 --> 00:34:29.463
and head to your aunt's place
in the countryside.

00:34:30.173 --> 00:34:31.716
You need to recharge as well.

00:34:33.134 --> 00:34:34.010
You can't…

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.346
keep going like this.

00:35:19.764 --> 00:35:20.890
Let's…

00:35:22.099 --> 00:35:23.267
break up.

00:35:23.351 --> 00:35:25.353
I'm suffering because of you.

00:35:26.145 --> 00:35:27.104
This is me…

00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:30.066
at rock bottom.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.174
Nice and bright, right?

00:36:14.777 --> 00:36:16.570
Based on the parameters you provided,

00:36:16.654 --> 00:36:18.698
they managed to narrow it down

00:36:19.282 --> 00:36:20.491
to this guy.

00:36:20.992 --> 00:36:23.327
Nam Su-yong, the manager
of the strategy team at MomsJoy.

00:36:25.371 --> 00:36:27.206
They tailed him for three days,

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:29.458
and they caught him
in a suspicious interaction.

00:36:30.668 --> 00:36:31.502
This one.

00:36:41.345 --> 00:36:42.305
Found you.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:48.644
Da-rim!

00:36:49.937 --> 00:36:50.855
Da-rim!

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.943
DA-RIM

00:36:58.779 --> 00:37:00.448
The caller you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

00:37:00.531 --> 00:37:02.908
You will be redirected to voicemail
after the beep.

00:37:08.289 --> 00:37:09.457
Please, Mr. Kim.

00:37:09.957 --> 00:37:12.710
You must know where Da-rim is right now.

00:37:13.294 --> 00:37:14.503
I do,

00:37:14.587 --> 00:37:15.463
of course.

00:37:17.214 --> 00:37:19.050
We can clear her name.

00:37:19.133 --> 00:37:20.426
We have evidence.

00:37:20.509 --> 00:37:22.094
If I can just explain it to her--

00:37:22.178 --> 00:37:23.846
How can I trust you?

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:28.267
I heard you two broke up.

00:37:29.685 --> 00:37:31.270
I have nothing more to say,
so please leave.

00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:36.859
I didn't agree to breaking up.

00:37:36.942 --> 00:37:37.902
Listen, Mr. Gong.

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:41.155
-Your father was the one--
-Exactly.

00:37:44.367 --> 00:37:45.493
That's why I'm here to protect her.

00:37:47.912 --> 00:37:49.413
So that no one can ever
lay a finger on her again.

00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:53.417
I'm going to protect her.

00:38:34.792 --> 00:38:36.168
Snack time!

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.295
Come eat!

00:38:38.379 --> 00:38:39.713
All right!

00:38:40.214 --> 00:38:41.173
Coming.

00:38:41.882 --> 00:38:43.884
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:38:45.094 --> 00:38:47.805
They sell radish water kimchi to go?

00:38:47.888 --> 00:38:48.931
Yeah.

00:38:49.014 --> 00:38:51.350
It's really popular in this town.

00:38:51.434 --> 00:38:53.269
It goes so well with sweet potatoes.

00:38:53.352 --> 00:38:54.895
-Try it.
-They're cooked well.

00:38:54.979 --> 00:38:57.440
So how's working at the orchard?

00:38:57.523 --> 00:38:58.441
It's hard, isn't it?

00:38:58.524 --> 00:39:00.151
Not at all.

00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:02.445
I think I picked more than you, Uncle.

00:39:03.028 --> 00:39:05.072
You're so lucky
to have a daughter like her.

00:39:05.156 --> 00:39:07.032
She's so quick and witty.

00:39:07.116 --> 00:39:08.868
Gyu-cheol is also dependable.

00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:11.954
Are you talking
about that unhelpful son of ours?

00:39:12.538 --> 00:39:15.416
I'd ask for nothing more if only he could
be the tiniest bit like Sang-sik.

00:39:15.499 --> 00:39:16.375
Sang-sik?

00:39:17.168 --> 00:39:19.211
-The village head's son?
-Yes.

00:39:21.046 --> 00:39:23.632
Sang-sik was the one
who came up with this.

00:39:23.716 --> 00:39:27.219
He's the best our village has to offer.

00:39:27.303 --> 00:39:28.429
He'll be here tomorrow.

00:39:28.512 --> 00:39:30.264
You should say hi.

00:39:30.347 --> 00:39:31.974
He's still single, you know.

00:39:32.725 --> 00:39:34.894
You're single too, right?

00:39:35.978 --> 00:39:37.313
Well,

00:39:37.396 --> 00:39:38.481
I guess I am.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.798
MR. GONG

00:40:25.402 --> 00:40:27.655
To account for sweating in the summer,

00:40:27.738 --> 00:40:29.865
we can use some sort of mesh fabric.

00:40:30.533 --> 00:40:34.036
How about making it with mesh fabric
and detachable?

00:40:34.119 --> 00:40:36.539
Two options for summer and winter.

00:40:36.622 --> 00:40:37.831
That could work.

00:40:37.915 --> 00:40:39.959
I can talk
to the development team tomorrow.

00:40:41.043 --> 00:40:42.044
I'm going home first.

00:40:43.462 --> 00:40:44.380
I'm really leaving.

00:40:46.674 --> 00:40:48.884
I don't know why hearing you
tell me to go home makes me so sad.

00:40:51.387 --> 00:40:52.513
Can't you stop me and make me stay?

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:56.809
I'm going home first.

00:40:58.811 --> 00:40:59.645
I'm really leaving.

00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:04.191
I don't know why hearing you
tell me to go home makes me so sad.

00:41:06.652 --> 00:41:07.778
Can't you stop me and make me stay?

00:41:10.072 --> 00:41:11.282
I just want to

00:41:12.366 --> 00:41:13.701
chat and laugh with you every day.

00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:17.121
Can you wait for me?

00:41:19.331 --> 00:41:20.916
As soon as my mom's stuff gets sorted out…

00:41:23.502 --> 00:41:25.087
I'm going to propose to you.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:30.467
I love you, Go Da-rim.

00:42:04.793 --> 00:42:05.961
Am I at the right place?

00:42:14.303 --> 00:42:15.304
BOK-SIL

00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:31.028
Who are you?

00:42:31.111 --> 00:42:31.987
-Wait.
-Tell me.

00:42:32.071 --> 00:42:34.907
How dare you sneak in here, you thief!

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.450
Wait!

00:42:36.533 --> 00:42:38.952
-Please calm down and hear me out.
-What?

00:42:39.036 --> 00:42:40.788
Why would I listen to a thief?

00:42:40.871 --> 00:42:42.414
You damn thief!

00:42:42.498 --> 00:42:43.749
You're dead meat today.

00:42:43.832 --> 00:42:45.042
You're so dead.

00:42:45.125 --> 00:42:45.959
Come here.

00:42:51.423 --> 00:42:52.841
-What's going on?
-Are you okay?

00:42:52.925 --> 00:42:54.593
-Who's that?
-You're dead meat.

00:42:54.677 --> 00:42:56.011
I'm going to end you.

00:43:00.641 --> 00:43:01.809
Ji-hyeok?

00:43:01.892 --> 00:43:02.851
Da-rim.

00:43:06.855 --> 00:43:07.856
What the…

00:43:08.607 --> 00:43:09.775
You know him?

00:43:10.776 --> 00:43:12.194
What are you doing here?

00:43:13.112 --> 00:43:14.238
Gi-chan.

00:43:14.321 --> 00:43:15.239
You can stop now.

00:43:15.322 --> 00:43:17.032
He's not a thief.

00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:19.451
He's Da-rim's boss.

00:43:21.995 --> 00:43:25.124
What brings you here
in the middle of the night?

00:43:26.875 --> 00:43:28.544
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:43:28.627 --> 00:43:29.586
I'm Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:30.587
Hello.

00:43:30.671 --> 00:43:32.381
I knew it was rude to come without notice,

00:43:32.464 --> 00:43:34.967
but I had something to discuss
with Da-rim.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:36.802
-Please forgive me.
-No, it's fine.

00:43:37.428 --> 00:43:38.512
If you know it was rude to do,

00:43:39.221 --> 00:43:40.514
you should leave.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.351
I'm sorry for disturbing you two.

00:43:44.435 --> 00:43:45.352
But still,

00:43:45.936 --> 00:43:47.646
he came all this way.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:49.565
No, I have nothing to say to him.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.358
You should head back now.

00:43:51.442 --> 00:43:52.443
I just need a second.

00:43:54.611 --> 00:43:55.779
I rushed over here.

00:43:57.364 --> 00:44:00.909
I didn't even have time to eat!

00:44:00.993 --> 00:44:02.035
What?

00:44:05.038 --> 00:44:06.540
You didn't eat yet?

00:44:08.834 --> 00:44:09.668
That's right.

00:44:09.752 --> 00:44:11.295
Oh dear.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.593
My goodness, I feel terrible.

00:44:18.135 --> 00:44:19.344
I didn't have time to prepare,

00:44:19.428 --> 00:44:22.473
so I was only able to put together
a few side dishes.

00:44:23.474 --> 00:44:24.892
This is a feast.

00:44:26.268 --> 00:44:27.478
Thank you so much.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.149
Take your time and eat up.

00:44:32.232 --> 00:44:33.150
I will.

00:44:55.464 --> 00:44:56.298
Go on.

00:45:12.606 --> 00:45:14.191
He's going to get indigestion.

00:45:14.274 --> 00:45:16.276
You should go to your rooms
so he can eat and leave.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.986
Right, of course.

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:20.072
We should let him eat in peace. Let's go.

00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:22.574
-Should we?
-Yeah, let's go.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:25.619
No, you don't need to.

00:45:26.119 --> 00:45:28.747
I actually love it
when people watch me eat.

00:45:29.331 --> 00:45:32.459
It makes the food tastier
and helps with digestion.

00:45:32.543 --> 00:45:33.835
Please continue watching me.

00:45:34.461 --> 00:45:35.462
Don't go anywhere.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:39.383
Sit down.

00:45:41.468 --> 00:45:42.386
Watch him eat.

00:45:47.391 --> 00:45:48.392
This is so good.

00:45:50.936 --> 00:45:52.437
It's nice to see you enjoy it.

00:45:53.564 --> 00:45:58.193
Anyway, what brings you all the way here
this late at night?

00:45:58.944 --> 00:46:01.280
By any chance, are you and Da-rim

00:46:02.531 --> 00:46:03.657
together or something?

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.325
-Yes, we are--
-No.

00:46:05.909 --> 00:46:07.202
We're not anymore.

00:46:07.786 --> 00:46:09.871
What? So he's a former boyfriend?

00:46:10.706 --> 00:46:11.957
Ex-boyfriend?

00:46:13.208 --> 00:46:15.335
All right then. We're all good.

00:46:16.336 --> 00:46:17.170
What do you mean?

00:46:17.254 --> 00:46:18.130
Well,

00:46:18.755 --> 00:46:21.717
Sang-sik asked if you had a boyfriend,

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.427
so I told him you didn't.

00:46:24.678 --> 00:46:27.889
This could've turned out very badly.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.642
Sang-sik?

00:46:30.726 --> 00:46:32.102
Kim Sang-sik.

00:46:32.185 --> 00:46:34.521
He has always taken
such great care of my niece

00:46:34.605 --> 00:46:36.523
ever since they were little kids.

00:46:37.024 --> 00:46:38.317
When Da-rim wanted persimmons,

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.945
he climbed up the tree,
but he ended up falling.

00:46:43.071 --> 00:46:45.032
He even cracked his head open.

00:46:45.115 --> 00:46:46.533
That's why Da-rim promised him

00:46:46.617 --> 00:46:49.870
that she'd take care of him forever,
remember?

00:46:49.953 --> 00:46:51.246
You remember, right, Myeong-sun?

00:46:51.747 --> 00:46:54.124
-Take care forever?
-We were just kids back then.

00:46:54.207 --> 00:46:55.083
Come on now.

00:46:55.167 --> 00:46:57.210
We laughed it off back then,

00:46:57.294 --> 00:46:59.713
but I think they'd make a cute couple.

00:46:59.796 --> 00:47:01.340
-Of course!
-Yeah!

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.133
I doubt that.

00:47:04.885 --> 00:47:07.429
Do you know Sang-sik?

00:47:08.013 --> 00:47:09.973
Well, no, I don't.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:13.935
I'm…

00:47:15.604 --> 00:47:16.647
not her ex-boyfriend.

00:47:17.439 --> 00:47:18.357
I'm her current boyfriend.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.484
-What?
-What?

00:47:21.068 --> 00:47:23.195
I came to take Da-rim back to Seoul.

00:47:24.279 --> 00:47:25.155
Hold on.

00:47:25.989 --> 00:47:27.032
You're going back?

00:47:27.115 --> 00:47:28.450
No, no.

00:47:28.533 --> 00:47:30.160
Don't go back.

00:47:30.243 --> 00:47:33.997
-Just marry Sang-sik and settle down here.
-Stop it.

00:47:34.081 --> 00:47:35.207
He's the youth association chairman,

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.626
he has a lot of land
and his family farm to inherit.

00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:39.419
He has a bright future ahead.

00:47:39.503 --> 00:47:42.297
He's also a former UDT soldier.

00:47:42.798 --> 00:47:43.674
I, too,

00:47:43.757 --> 00:47:46.718
served in the Republic of Korea Army
and was discharged as a sergeant.

00:47:52.015 --> 00:47:54.059
-You did?
-Yes.

00:47:54.142 --> 00:47:55.936
Good for you.

00:47:56.019 --> 00:47:57.479
Finish the rest of your meal.

00:47:57.562 --> 00:47:58.647
Pardon?

00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:59.648
Eat up.

00:48:01.858 --> 00:48:02.693
Okay.

00:48:06.113 --> 00:48:07.030
Take your time.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.586
-You should go back--
-Take a look at this.

00:48:24.673 --> 00:48:25.507
Okay.

00:48:33.557 --> 00:48:35.434
The man I saw at the exhibition fire

00:48:35.517 --> 00:48:37.811
was seen meeting
with a representative from MomsJoy.

00:48:38.395 --> 00:48:39.354
It means

00:48:39.438 --> 00:48:41.982
both incidents were deliberately planned
by the same person.

00:48:42.065 --> 00:48:44.109
Who would do that?
Why would they take it this far?

00:48:44.192 --> 00:48:46.820
They framed you to get rid of me.

00:48:49.656 --> 00:48:51.324
They knew you were my weakness.

00:48:53.869 --> 00:48:55.829
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

00:48:56.538 --> 00:48:58.915
I thought this would be the best option.

00:48:58.999 --> 00:49:01.710
You were just caught in the crossfire
because of me.

00:49:04.463 --> 00:49:05.547
I should be sorry.

00:49:07.591 --> 00:49:09.342
Once this man is caught,

00:49:09.426 --> 00:49:10.635
your name

00:49:11.678 --> 00:49:12.679
will be cleared.

00:49:15.182 --> 00:49:16.433
So take it back.

00:49:17.017 --> 00:49:18.351
What do you mean?

00:49:18.435 --> 00:49:19.603
The breakup.

00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:21.438
Take it back now.

00:49:22.522 --> 00:49:24.900
You just said I was your weakness.

00:49:24.983 --> 00:49:26.359
If I stay by your side,

00:49:26.443 --> 00:49:28.153
I'll only make you weaker
as your weakness.

00:49:28.236 --> 00:49:29.780
Do you still not get it?

00:49:29.863 --> 00:49:31.948
I grow weaker when we're apart.

00:49:32.032 --> 00:49:35.410
I'm on the verge of collapsing right now,
so take it back.

00:49:35.494 --> 00:49:36.578
Take it back…

00:49:39.581 --> 00:49:41.583
and say you'll come back to Seoul with me.

00:49:42.209 --> 00:49:43.335
I won't leave until you do.

00:49:44.252 --> 00:49:45.086
Whatever.

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:46.630
-Hold on. My mom is here too.
-I'm not leaving.

00:49:46.713 --> 00:49:48.757
-Housing would still be an issue.
-Whatever.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.009
Why are you taking your socks off?

00:49:54.346 --> 00:49:55.931
Are you still talking?

00:49:56.014 --> 00:49:57.641
No, we're done.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.315
We have to get up early for farmwork.

00:50:05.857 --> 00:50:07.234
Let's get to bed.

00:50:07.317 --> 00:50:08.777
-Let me.
-It's fine. I'll do it.

00:50:09.444 --> 00:50:11.279
Da-rim, you can sleep here.

00:50:11.363 --> 00:50:13.865
Mr. Gong, you can sleep with me
in the living room.

00:50:13.949 --> 00:50:15.033
It'll be nice and cozy.

00:50:15.116 --> 00:50:17.577
Wait, sir, we're sleeping together?

00:50:17.661 --> 00:50:20.080
What, are you going to sleep with Bok-sil
in the yard?

00:50:20.872 --> 00:50:22.582
-Bok-sil's house is small.
-Good night.

00:50:22.666 --> 00:50:23.667
Good night.

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:24.918
Go and sleep.

00:50:25.001 --> 00:50:27.170
-Hurry up, let's go to sleep.
-Yes, sir. Coming.

00:50:27.254 --> 00:50:28.380
Good night.

00:50:41.101 --> 00:50:42.227
Mr. Gong.

00:50:43.228 --> 00:50:44.229
Hello?

00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:47.524
You slept enough. You should get up now.

00:50:48.191 --> 00:50:49.985
We have so much work to do today.

00:50:50.819 --> 00:50:51.778
Hello?

00:50:51.862 --> 00:50:52.779
Mr. Gong.

00:50:54.948 --> 00:50:56.533
Fine. Keep sleeping.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.451
Sleep the day away.

00:50:59.786 --> 00:51:03.874
I wanted to see if you were strong enough
to be a good fit for my niece,

00:51:03.957 --> 00:51:05.083
but I guess not.

00:51:05.959 --> 00:51:07.460
I knew Sang-sik was the one.

00:51:12.799 --> 00:51:13.925
It's already morning?

00:51:14.676 --> 00:51:15.886
Where should I start?

00:51:16.469 --> 00:51:17.470
Just tell me what to do.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:50.587
Gosh, he ate the most at breakfast,
but he's as weak as can be.

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:52.297
Move it already!

00:51:53.715 --> 00:51:55.133
Sorry, sir.

00:51:55.216 --> 00:51:57.844
-It's my first time farming.
-Oh gosh.

00:51:57.928 --> 00:51:59.346
Oh no.

00:51:59.429 --> 00:52:01.806
He picked all the unripe ones.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:03.600
-Sorry?
-Jeez.

00:52:03.683 --> 00:52:05.894
But the sir here said
these were ripe enough to be picked.

00:52:05.977 --> 00:52:07.562
There you go again.

00:52:07.646 --> 00:52:10.190
Why do you keep calling me "sir"
like I'm some old man?

00:52:10.273 --> 00:52:13.234
I'm not even 60 yet, okay?

00:52:14.694 --> 00:52:16.655
Look carefully. Look.

00:52:17.238 --> 00:52:18.615
Gi-chan!

00:52:19.616 --> 00:52:21.159
What in the world is that?

00:52:30.543 --> 00:52:33.630
SANG-SIK'S MUSIC

00:52:52.649 --> 00:52:54.943
My goodness, the weather's spectacular.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.405
Hey, Gi-chan. Have you been well?

00:52:58.488 --> 00:52:59.364
Yeah.

00:52:59.906 --> 00:53:00.991
Did you hear that?

00:53:01.074 --> 00:53:03.368
My gosh. Welcome, Sang-sik.

00:53:04.369 --> 00:53:07.247
Did your training go well?

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.874
Yes, all thanks to you.

00:53:09.958 --> 00:53:13.878
Goodness me. You've become even prettier
over a few days, Myeong-ja.

00:53:13.962 --> 00:53:14.963
Is it that obvious?

00:53:16.381 --> 00:53:18.717
Did you already start harvesting?

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.969
Jeez, I told you to wait for me.

00:53:21.052 --> 00:53:22.929
What's the point of lounging around?

00:53:23.513 --> 00:53:25.515
We have my sister-in-law

00:53:25.598 --> 00:53:26.933
and Da-rim visiting from Seoul.

00:53:27.017 --> 00:53:28.476
They were helping out.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.894
Sang-sik.

00:53:30.687 --> 00:53:32.313
It's been forever.

00:53:32.397 --> 00:53:35.608
My aunt and uncle told me
how successful you've become.

00:53:35.692 --> 00:53:37.861
Gosh, I'm flattered.

00:53:37.944 --> 00:53:39.446
Have you been well?

00:53:39.529 --> 00:53:41.197
Why haven't you come to visit
all this time?

00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:42.615
I missed you so much.

00:53:42.699 --> 00:53:44.159
I was too busy making a living.

00:53:45.201 --> 00:53:47.287
It's so nice to see you.

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:51.583
Since you're here,
you should stay a while.

00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:53.960
We can hang out like we used to
when we were kids.

00:53:54.044 --> 00:53:56.171
Sounds good.

00:53:56.254 --> 00:53:57.213
Excuse me.

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:01.468
Da-rim is going back to Seoul with me.

00:54:02.302 --> 00:54:03.219
Who are you?

00:54:03.887 --> 00:54:07.140
-I'm…
-Her former boyfriend.

00:54:07.223 --> 00:54:09.267
The ex-boyfriend.

00:54:10.101 --> 00:54:12.771
It seems like Da-rim's over him,

00:54:12.854 --> 00:54:15.732
but I don't know
why he came all this way to be clingy.

00:54:18.193 --> 00:54:20.278
I mean, it makes sense.

00:54:20.361 --> 00:54:21.279
I understand.

00:54:21.988 --> 00:54:24.491
You won't find a better woman
than my Da-rim.

00:54:25.075 --> 00:54:26.159
That's why

00:54:26.701 --> 00:54:28.244
I still can't forget about her.

00:54:29.454 --> 00:54:32.248
Gosh, why would you joke around like that?

00:54:37.587 --> 00:54:38.505
"My" Da-rim?

00:54:40.006 --> 00:54:41.382
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

00:54:41.466 --> 00:54:43.885
I'll buy you lots of delicious food.

00:54:43.968 --> 00:54:46.888
I've made a lot of money.

00:54:46.971 --> 00:54:47.806
You know?

00:54:49.641 --> 00:54:51.601
Come on. Stop that already.

00:54:54.562 --> 00:54:55.522
What's with him?

00:54:59.067 --> 00:55:02.237
Ji-hyeok, you shouldn't cut the branches.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.155
You need to cut it closer to the stem.

00:55:04.239 --> 00:55:05.532
Yes, a bit lower.

00:55:42.402 --> 00:55:43.319
That's amazing.

00:56:02.755 --> 00:56:03.673
Are you okay?

00:56:03.756 --> 00:56:05.550
Jeez. Hurry it up already.

00:56:08.553 --> 00:56:09.888
Let me.

00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:10.847
I'm fine.

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:11.806
Go on.

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:23.610
Okay.

00:56:53.765 --> 00:56:54.849
There we go.

00:56:56.059 --> 00:56:58.853
We don't want to damage
that fine skin of yours.

00:56:59.979 --> 00:57:01.064
Thanks.

00:57:04.234 --> 00:57:07.195
You just relax and enjoy this ice cream.

00:57:07.278 --> 00:57:09.072
I'll take care of everything else.

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:20.500
Come on, it's going to melt.

00:57:26.339 --> 00:57:28.091
Ji-hyeok, are you okay?

00:57:29.884 --> 00:57:31.344
Are you okay? Oh no.

00:57:33.429 --> 00:57:34.514
Are you okay?

00:57:35.431 --> 00:57:36.349
Are you?

00:57:37.141 --> 00:57:38.309
That's a relief.

00:57:41.145 --> 00:57:42.480
You must be tired.

00:57:45.149 --> 00:57:46.150
Here we go.

00:57:49.279 --> 00:57:53.241
So why would you even think
you stood a chance against him

00:57:53.324 --> 00:57:55.618
when you've never even been on a farm?

00:57:57.453 --> 00:57:58.705
That's the wrong spot.

00:57:58.788 --> 00:57:59.747
What? Really?

00:57:59.831 --> 00:58:00.873
A bit further up.

00:58:00.957 --> 00:58:02.458
Okay, hold. Further up.

00:58:02.542 --> 00:58:04.335
-No, further up.
-Here?

00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:05.753
No, further up.

00:58:05.837 --> 00:58:07.380
-Where?
-A bit more.

00:58:07.463 --> 00:58:08.590
No, further up.

00:58:08.673 --> 00:58:10.258
-I don't think--
-More.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.845
How can you be joking around right now?

00:58:16.306 --> 00:58:18.600
I didn't like the way he looked at you,

00:58:18.683 --> 00:58:20.768
and everyone was praising him.

00:58:20.852 --> 00:58:23.229
I wanted to look cool too,
but nothing was going my way.

00:58:25.189 --> 00:58:26.941
I rushed because I felt anxious.

00:58:27.525 --> 00:58:29.027
Even so,

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:33.031
did you think I'd call you manly
for being good at farmwork?

00:58:33.823 --> 00:58:35.408
Did you think I'd be impressed

00:58:35.491 --> 00:58:38.703
if I saw you push yourself
to the point of injury?

00:58:39.287 --> 00:58:40.830
You're unbelievable.

00:58:40.913 --> 00:58:42.832
Why are you smiling?

00:58:43.541 --> 00:58:44.375
I like it.

00:58:44.459 --> 00:58:45.460
What?

00:58:46.502 --> 00:58:48.004
Thank you for nagging me.

00:58:50.548 --> 00:58:52.133
It means you're worried about me.

00:58:53.009 --> 00:58:55.303
As if. When did I worry about you?

00:58:56.304 --> 00:58:57.180
I'm here

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.517
because I want to hear you nag
for the rest of my life.

00:59:13.404 --> 00:59:14.822
I missed you so much.

00:59:17.116 --> 00:59:17.992
I love you.

00:59:24.374 --> 00:59:26.084
-Unbelievable.
-I missed you.

00:59:26.167 --> 00:59:27.001
Seriously.

00:59:28.002 --> 00:59:28.920
Are you okay?

00:59:29.712 --> 00:59:30.588
It hurts.

00:59:34.258 --> 00:59:36.052
Drive safely.

00:59:36.969 --> 00:59:38.179
Just wait for a little longer.

00:59:38.262 --> 00:59:40.807
I'll be sure to prove your innocence

00:59:41.432 --> 00:59:42.558
and come back for you.

00:59:44.894 --> 00:59:45.895
Oh, right.

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:48.564
This is a copy

00:59:48.648 --> 00:59:51.734
of the voice notes I recorded
while working on the new product.

00:59:51.818 --> 00:59:54.612
There are a lot of ideas on there
that were never used.

00:59:54.696 --> 00:59:56.280
I thought

00:59:56.364 --> 00:59:58.282
they might come in handy later on.

00:59:58.908 --> 00:59:59.867
All right.

01:00:00.868 --> 01:00:02.245
Are you leaving?

01:00:02.328 --> 01:00:03.830
Yes, I'll be heading back now.

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.709
I'm sorry for causing you distress.

01:00:07.792 --> 01:00:09.585
Not at all.

01:00:09.669 --> 01:00:12.088
You must've had a hard time
because of Da-rim.

01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:13.673
I'm the one who's sorry.

01:00:16.843 --> 01:00:19.929
This is steamed corn and rice punch.

01:00:20.012 --> 01:00:21.681
They're snacks for the road.

01:00:23.433 --> 01:00:24.434
They're my favorites.

01:00:28.229 --> 01:00:29.313
They're still warm.

01:00:29.397 --> 01:00:32.650
I figured you'd like them,
so I just steamed them.

01:00:33.234 --> 01:00:35.236
Thank you. I'll be sure to enjoy them.

01:00:35.319 --> 01:00:36.863
All right. Drive safely.

01:00:36.946 --> 01:00:37.780
Get back safely.

01:00:57.508 --> 01:01:01.012
My vote is for Ji-hyeok, not Sang-sik.

01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:06.476
What? Why do you get to choose?

01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:09.771
Then again, I'm on the same page.

01:01:17.278 --> 01:01:18.362
Hey, Da-rim.

01:01:20.573 --> 01:01:21.616
I'll wrap things up and be on my way.

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:23.284
Bye.

01:01:33.628 --> 01:01:36.672
A major incident occurred
at Natural BeBe recently.

01:01:36.756 --> 01:01:37.882
MOTHER TF EMPLOYEE GO DA-RIM
MARRIAGE STATUS: UNMARRIED

01:01:37.965 --> 01:01:38.800
Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok

01:01:38.883 --> 01:01:41.803
had been romantically involved
with his subordinate,

01:01:41.886 --> 01:01:44.514
and he overlooked the fact that
she lied to secure her position.

01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:49.310
Therefore, I'd like to request
a special vote concerning the dismissal

01:01:49.393 --> 01:01:51.187
of Mother TF Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok.

01:01:52.563 --> 01:01:54.524
Please cast your votes now.

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:04.742
It's Team Leader Gong.

01:02:49.745 --> 01:02:54.667
DYNAMITE KISS

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.450
Now, let's get in there.

01:03:27.533 --> 01:03:29.785
That is to say, today's special vote
is null and void.

01:03:29.869 --> 01:03:33.456
Neither you nor Chairman Gong
is qualified to run this company.

01:03:33.539 --> 01:03:34.540
Yes, that's right.

01:03:34.624 --> 01:03:37.084
There's someone else more qualified
to run this company.

01:03:37.168 --> 01:03:38.252
It's her.

01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:39.462
Did it go well?

01:03:39.545 --> 01:03:40.880
I'm on my way to you.

01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:43.549
It's all because of that bastard,
Gong Ji-hyeok.

01:03:43.633 --> 01:03:45.301
You're almost here, right?

01:03:45.384 --> 01:03:47.386
Hello? Ji-hyeok? Ji-hyeok!

01:03:48.179 --> 01:03:49.096
Ji-hyeok!

01:03:51.849 --> 01:03:56.854
