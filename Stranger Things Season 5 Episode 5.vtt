00:22.689 --> 00:26.026
Do you know why I chose them?

00:29.946 --> 00:33.783
Why I chose them to reshape the world?

00:34.617 --> 00:37.954
It is because they are weak.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.916
Easily broken.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.963
Easily reshaped.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.049
Controlled.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.803
The perfect vessels.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.059
Oh, baby.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.977
-Mom.
-Oh, baby.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.772
I don't understand. How did you…?

01:03.855 --> 01:07.108
He's a sorcerer.
A real-life, honest-to-God sorcerer.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.234
Mike.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.781
You did it. You really did it.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.534
The kids.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.787
Vecna… he's got the kids.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.081
I know. Derek, Mary, Glenn.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.417
No. Not just them.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.380
The others,
they didn't make it out of Hawkins.

01:31.049 --> 01:34.594
I could've helped them fight
if I had just acted sooner.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.388
But I was too late.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.101
And now he's got all of them.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.145
All 12.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.273
We failed.

01:48.566 --> 01:49.567
I failed.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.152
No.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.951
The tunnels. Radio Shack.

02:47.041 --> 02:51.337
Your memory of what happened,
of how you came to be here might be foggy…

02:52.338 --> 02:53.339
-Mary!
-…confused.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.340
Holly!

02:54.424 --> 02:56.968
The monsters… they tried to take you.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.011
Hi!

02:58.511 --> 03:00.305
But I saved you just in time.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.764
-How are you?
-Good.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.601
This place, my home,

03:05.101 --> 03:06.686
is now your home too.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.354
Your sanctuary.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.691
As long as you do not venture
into the woods where the monsters live,

03:11.774 --> 03:13.484
you will be safe here.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.571
Now, I know many of you are wondering

03:16.654 --> 03:19.574
when the rest of your friends and family
will join us here.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.202
The difficult truth is
there is more at stake

03:22.285 --> 03:24.245
than just the lives of your loved ones.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.999
I don't wish to frighten you.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.502
But I believe you are brave enough
to know the truth.

03:32.086 --> 03:35.632
An evil darkness is spreading
across not just Hawkins,

03:35.715 --> 03:36.925
but the whole world,

03:37.008 --> 03:40.553
and soon it will be too late to stop it.

03:40.637 --> 03:44.849
You can think of this darkness
like the Black Thing in your book.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.101
Just as the Black Thing
threatened Meg's family,

03:47.185 --> 03:48.770
so does the darkness threaten yours,

03:48.853 --> 03:52.190
but I believe I have found a way
to defeat this darkness.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.483
How?

03:55.109 --> 03:59.530
I have traveled far and long
beyond our dimension.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.784
In my travels, I discovered another world.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.245
A world far from Earth.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.998
This world is much like ours, only…

04:09.624 --> 04:10.708
good.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.294
Free of monsters and darkness.

04:14.712 --> 04:15.838
It is the light.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.717
Which brings me to the true reason
why you have been chosen.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.760
You…

04:21.511 --> 04:23.263
are not like other children.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.057
Like Meg, you are special.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.060
You have dormant powers in here.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.940
And I believe if we work together,
we can awaken those powers,

04:34.023 --> 04:37.193
channel our energy
and draw this new world to ours.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.820
And as the light…

04:40.405 --> 04:41.781
reaches the darkness,

04:42.365 --> 04:44.117
the light will expel the darkness,

04:44.701 --> 04:47.036
your loved ones will be saved, and you…

04:49.289 --> 04:50.623
you will be heroes.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.963
Yes, Holly?

04:57.755 --> 05:00.341
Are you going to leave again?

05:01.009 --> 05:03.594
To bring more, uh, special kids here?

05:03.678 --> 05:05.972
Poor Holly. She was the first one chosen,

05:06.848 --> 05:08.850
and she was left here all alone.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.728
But don't worry, I won't be leaving you.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.063
Any of you. Ever again.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.107
But for now,

05:16.190 --> 05:18.484
eat and play.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.362
And most importantly, rest.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.656
Because tomorrow?

05:25.783 --> 05:27.160
Tomorrow, it begins.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.880
You said no one left this room.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.966
That's direct from Sec.
No one came in or out.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.843
You're saying what?
They vanished like Houdini?

07:06.926 --> 07:07.969
I don't know, sir.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.054
I want every square inch
of this building checked.

07:10.138 --> 07:14.225
Every room, vent, access panel.
Let's go. Move. Move!

07:52.054 --> 07:52.972
You okay?

07:53.055 --> 07:55.224
I lost it.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.477
We're too far.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.855
It's okay. We're far enough away
they're not gonna catch up with us now.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.482
That's a hell of a trick you pulled.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.402
I mean,
maybe I should say it was bitchin'.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.655
Wasn't that the word
you added to El's vocabulary?

08:10.239 --> 08:13.367
I'm a… bad influence.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.703
Yeah, join the club.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.678
-Lucas?
-Shit.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.514
-Oh, no.
-Hey. Hey, guys.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.806
Oh, no.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.683
-Hey.
-Oh, shit.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.060
It's just a scratch.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.395
-God, Mike, first aid.
-Shit. Shit, shit!

08:41.479 --> 08:43.105
Let's see.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.899
-Can you lift it? Show us?
-Yeah.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.069
Ugh!

08:48.152 --> 08:49.820
That's not too bad.

08:49.904 --> 08:50.947
Oh, shit.

08:51.030 --> 08:55.159
Yeah, it looks like just the right amount
for a couple of badass scars.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.370
I'm sorry I couldn't protect the kids.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.413
You did everything you could.
You… You fought.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.416
You risked your life.
Nice swing, by the way.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.294
You saw?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.213
He more than just saw.

09:09.298 --> 09:14.303
So, Demos floating, limbs snapping, dying.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.389
That was… That was all you?

09:16.472 --> 09:19.141
I mean… Yeah.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.476
Holy shit.

09:21.727 --> 09:22.853
Holy shit.

09:22.937 --> 09:27.942
You know what this means, right?
You're like Will the Wise, but for real.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.778
-Not really.
-He's more like a sorcerer than a wizard.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.239
Okay, yeah. I mean, sure.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.241
But you get what I'm saying,
though, right?

09:35.324 --> 09:37.702
Like, this totally changes the game.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.120
We got our second El.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.998
I'm not like a second El.
I don't have powers.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.917
I'm just… I'm siphoning.
I'm stealing Vecna's.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.461
And to do that,
I have to be near the hive mind,

09:47.545 --> 09:48.879
and Vecna's not coming back.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.048
-But his Demos might.
-I don't think so.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.259
They came for the kids,
and he's got them all,

09:53.342 --> 09:55.177
and he has his vessels.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.725
"Vessels"?

10:00.808 --> 10:06.147
That's what he called them. He said,
"vessels for reshaping the world."

10:06.230 --> 10:08.190
I just hope your theory's wrong.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.026
What theory?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.069
November 6th.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.989
The day all this started…

10:16.574 --> 10:17.742
is the day it ends.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.372
You good?

10:28.753 --> 10:33.174
Okay, Lucas, take it slow. Take it slow.
I got you. I got you.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.802
Come on, man. One more step.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.971
Hey, hey. Come here.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.894
I wonder if there's a way
we can jack back into the hive mind

10:44.977 --> 10:46.604
and access his powers again.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.439
That's not possible, not unless--

10:48.522 --> 10:50.691
The hive is close, I know.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.610
But what happened tonight,

10:52.693 --> 10:54.737
none of us thought
that was possible either.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.821
Mom.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.990
Listen, I'm just saying, what if…

10:58.074 --> 11:00.201
what if this time,

11:00.284 --> 11:02.828
you don't use your powers
against his army.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.666
You use them against him, against Vecna.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.668
Stab him with his own sword.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.878
You didn't fail tonight.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.214
What you did…

11:14.131 --> 11:16.133
was extraordinary.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.761
You said so yourself.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.431
Vecna chose you
because he underestimated you.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.476
I think we all have. I know I did.

11:25.559 --> 11:29.563
And that is a mistake
I will never, ever make again.

11:30.314 --> 11:33.651
But I'm willing to bet everything
that he does.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.319
And when he does,

11:35.403 --> 11:39.573
it'll be the last mistake
that son of a bitch ever makes.

11:53.462 --> 11:56.382
It's a miracle
they made it back in one piece.

11:57.049 --> 12:01.470
Wish I could say the same thing
about Harrington's precious Beamer.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.557
This is what you're gonna do?

12:05.057 --> 12:07.309
Act like nothing happened, make jokes?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.316
You find Vecna, you come home.
That was always the plan.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.444
-That was never real, was it?
-Of course it was real.

12:16.527 --> 12:17.695
You're lying.

12:17.778 --> 12:21.073
Just like how you lied about my training.
You couldn't have me on your crawls

12:21.157 --> 12:23.659
because your plan was
to kill Vecna alone and die.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.371
Hey. Listen to me.
What happened today was different.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.958
The kryptonite, you couldn't fight.
I didn't have a choice.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.585
And the bomb?

12:32.668 --> 12:35.504
The bomb was… It was a fail-safe.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.549
A fail-safe no one knew about.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.136
I saw in your eyes tonight.

12:43.679 --> 12:44.805
I saw.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.100
You were planning to die.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.646
And you always were.

12:55.733 --> 12:56.734
Hey!

12:57.359 --> 12:59.820
Your friends were
supposed to be here, yeah?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.834
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.687
Well, this looks really promising.

13:33.771 --> 13:34.939
We're in the lobby.

13:35.564 --> 13:39.318
And… where are we going exactly?

13:39.401 --> 13:42.780
Right. Like, what is it we're looking for?

13:42.863 --> 13:45.658
-You've all seen Return of the Jedi?
-The one with the teddy bears?

13:45.741 --> 13:47.535
-Ewoks.
-Yeah, it's the best one.

13:47.618 --> 13:51.163
-Is it?
-No, but every child loves it, so tracks.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.623
In the film, if you recall,

13:52.706 --> 13:54.834
the rebels need to destroy
a second Death Star,

13:54.917 --> 13:57.169
but it's surrounded
by a protective energy shield,

13:57.253 --> 13:59.046
which is created by a shield generator.

13:59.129 --> 14:02.299
Yeah, cool. Thanks for the summary
of a movie we've all seen.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.468
It's an oddly relevant movie, Steve.

14:05.052 --> 14:09.557
Look, I think this circular flesh wall is
Vecna's version of an energy shield,

14:09.640 --> 14:11.267
except it's not sci-fi.

14:11.350 --> 14:15.354
It's supernatural,
created by Vecna's dark magic.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.982
And this dark magic shield
is what's preventing us

14:18.065 --> 14:19.567
from reaching him and saving Holly.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.901
But if my math is correct,

14:20.985 --> 14:23.028
the generator for the shield
has to be in this lab.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.407
So if we find
this dark magic shield generator…

14:26.490 --> 14:28.617
-We destroy the wall.
-Find Vecna, save Holly.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.702
Medals for all.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.370
And it looks like what?

14:31.453 --> 14:33.163
How would you expect me to know that?

14:49.138 --> 14:50.139
Up or down?

14:51.348 --> 14:53.934
I say both. Search in teams of two.
Cover more ground.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.062
Yeah, that's cool with me,
but can we just switch the teams up?

14:57.146 --> 14:58.856
Nance, you and me to go up?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.482
-Oh, I mean…
-Are you serious?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.276
Me and Henderson need some space.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.193
-Please.
-Please.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.486
Fine. How about me and you?

15:04.570 --> 15:05.905
I think we need some space too.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.616
So everyone but Nancy.
That's just… It's convenient.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.368
-Huh.
-Hey, we don't have time for this.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.245
Let's keep it simple,
stick to the usual teams.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.538
-Nance, I can't--
-I can't–

15:14.622 --> 15:16.040
End of discussion.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.668
Awesome.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.173
Just awesome.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.650
Heart and soul

15:42.733 --> 15:45.277
-I'm gonna get you!
-Nuh-uh.

15:45.819 --> 15:49.031
The way a fool would do, madly…

15:49.949 --> 15:50.991
You're it!

15:52.451 --> 15:53.869
I'm gonna get you!

15:54.703 --> 15:57.164
I can't believe
you had a whole day here without me.

15:57.247 --> 16:00.834
What do you think? I'm never sure.
Does green work on me?

16:02.544 --> 16:04.421
Yeah, totally.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.800
-What's going on with you?
-Nothing.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.176
You're acting weird.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.344
I think…

16:11.011 --> 16:13.555
I ate too much cake or something.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.183
Maybe Mr. Whatsit has some tea?

16:16.266 --> 16:18.310
I'm sure he does. He has everything.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.500
-What are you doing here?
-We need to talk.

16:41.583 --> 16:44.086
-Holly, the plan--
-Was to wait for Henry to leave. I know.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.463
But he was talking
and saying all this creepy stuff.

16:46.547 --> 16:50.426
-Did anyone see you come here?
-No, I was careful. Please, just listen.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.969
I know why Henry kidnapped us.

16:52.052 --> 16:56.640
He's going to somehow use us
to draw another world to ours, to Earth.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.018
"Draw another world"?
I don't understand what that means.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.771
Henry says it's to save Earth,
but I think it's really to destroy it.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.107
Whatever he's planning,
he's going to do it tomorrow.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.317
We have to get out of Camazotz right now.

17:07.401 --> 17:10.279
We'll never make it.
As soon as he realizes that you're gone,

17:10.362 --> 17:12.740
he'll track you down with his powers
and catch us.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.161
-Are you sure no one saw you?
-Positive.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.760
-Who the hell are you?
-Derek. Who the hell are you?

17:32.843 --> 17:34.595
What are you doing here, dipshit?

17:34.678 --> 17:37.222
I'm not Dipshit Derek anymore.
I'm Delightful Derek.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.474
-Much did you hear?
-Not much.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.019
Just how you wanna escape but can't
because you need Henry to leave first,

17:42.102 --> 17:44.396
otherwise he'll find you
with his evil Vecna magic.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.774
"Vecna"? I didn't say that name.
How do you know that name?

17:46.857 --> 17:48.317
-Mike.
-Mike?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.234
My brother Mike?

17:49.318 --> 17:52.071
-He's like my best friend now.
-You're best friends with Mike?

17:52.154 --> 17:55.199
And also Will and Lucas and Erica
and Mrs. Byers and Miss Robin.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.076
We tried to save the others,
but that didn't work.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.994
So I'm here.
I thought I couldn't trust anyone.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.954
Then I saw your face
during Mr. Whatsit's speech,

18:01.038 --> 18:02.915
and I was like,
"She knows he's full of shit."

18:02.998 --> 18:06.335
So I followed you into the woods,
and obviously I was right on the money.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.295
-So can I come with you?
-No!

18:08.378 --> 18:10.798
None of us are going anywhere.
Not as long as Henry's watching.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.217
What if we make sure he's not?

18:14.259 --> 18:15.803
You can't come with us.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.264
But maybe you can help us escape.

18:19.348 --> 18:24.228
But you really need to drop
this new "Delightful" thing,

18:24.311 --> 18:27.815
because if this is gonna work,
we need Dipshit Derek.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.029
Okay, the goal is simple.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.323
We get Will close to the hive mind.

18:36.406 --> 18:40.035
Once he is, he jacks back in.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.371
Only this time,
he doesn't go after a Demo.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.498
He goes after Vecna.

18:44.581 --> 18:50.295
One blow takes him out, ends him,
ends his army, ends this nightmare.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.548
That's it. So…

18:53.298 --> 18:58.011
What do you think? What?
Any ideas, thoughts?

18:58.095 --> 18:59.513
There's no bad ideas.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.433
I mean, I think it's, uh, a great plan.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.812
Uh, I mean, it's a…
It's a great plan, right?

19:06.895 --> 19:07.896
Hey.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.066
Yeah, no. Yes, it's a…

19:11.567 --> 19:12.818
It's a great plan.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.153
It's just…

19:14.236 --> 19:15.320
It's just…

19:15.404 --> 19:17.906
Will, you took out that Demo
with your mind?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.491
-I mean…
-Three to be exact.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.784
Simultaneously.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.036
Well, butter my butt
and call me a biscuit!

19:23.120 --> 19:24.413
A real-life wizard.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.582
A sorcerer, actually. His powers are--

19:26.665 --> 19:27.916
Innate. Yes, thank you.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.127
-What does that matter?
-It matters.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.462
Can we all just focus, please?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.798
Okay, I will start.

19:36.717 --> 19:41.054
We could build another telemetry thingy.

19:41.138 --> 19:45.976
And then we could find El
and Jonathan and the others,

19:46.059 --> 19:47.978
and hope they have a track on Vecna.

19:48.061 --> 19:51.148
Dustin hand-built that tracker himself.
I have no idea how it works.

19:51.231 --> 19:54.234
Maybe we could put our heads together
and try to figure it out,

19:54.318 --> 19:55.277
but it'll probably take…

19:55.360 --> 19:57.154
Days, days that we don't have.

19:57.237 --> 20:00.991
What if we put Will in the back of the van
and drive him around like a human antenna?

20:01.074 --> 20:02.743
-What?
-She said no bad ideas.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.328
Okay, what else?

20:04.912 --> 20:06.663
Come on, guys, what else?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.040
Anything.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.833
Anything.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.127
Is anyone else starving?

20:22.638 --> 20:23.639
Bugles?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.265
The world is ending.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.475
Precisely.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.895
The human mind needs energy and nutrients
to sustain focus and creativity.

20:29.978 --> 20:30.938
Hmm?

20:31.605 --> 20:32.606
Eat.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.264
-I got it! I got it!
-I got it! I got it. I got it.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.932
Okay, I'll go first.

21:07.015 --> 21:11.812
Dustin is MIA, but his mentor… is not.

21:11.895 --> 21:14.356
-Mr. Clarke?
-He's the biggest nerd in Hawkins.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.233
He taught Dustin everything he knows.

21:16.316 --> 21:19.486
If anyone can build a new tracker,
and build one fast, it's him.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.946
That could work.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.699
Yeah, but that'll just take time.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.327
My plan is faster, bolder, better.

21:28.453 --> 21:31.915
As I was heating up my popcorn,
I thought about Billy in the sauna.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.627
We heated him up
to activate the particles, right?

21:35.711 --> 21:38.547
They were dormant,
just like these kernels,

21:38.630 --> 21:41.717
just like the particles
inside the Demos Will killed.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.844
To bring 'em back to life,
we have to heat 'em up.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.805
There are 50,000 watts flowing
through that tower.

21:48.557 --> 21:52.311
We pump the dead Demos with electricity,
shock those particles back to life,

21:52.394 --> 21:56.440
and voilà,
we've got ourselves an instant hive mind.

21:56.523 --> 22:00.068
You want to Dr. Frankenstein a dead Demo?
That's your big idea?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.571
-Your plan is slow as shit.
-Your plan is stupid as shit.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.489
Hey, hey, children, stop it!

22:04.573 --> 22:05.866
Let's be clear.

22:05.949 --> 22:09.578
They each have flaws.
Many, many, many flaws.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.288
So we try both.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.875
We throw two darts
and pray for a bullseye.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.850
Okay, that was too many stairs.

22:33.101 --> 22:36.646
Treasures are always hidden
in the deepest depths of the dungeon.

22:38.315 --> 22:41.568
What is it, a treasure
or a magic shield generator?

22:41.651 --> 22:43.779
Keep your metaphors straight, dude.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.322
Analogy.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.125
Okay.

22:57.751 --> 23:01.338
Did not expect to find a daycare
in this hellhole.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.547
That's a perk.

23:03.673 --> 23:06.468
Holy shit, Henderson.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.594
You were right.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.099
Treasure.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.228
-Okay, you know what?
-What?

23:16.311 --> 23:19.231
This is the perfect spot for you,
considering your arrested development.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.816
While I search the rest of the basement,

23:20.899 --> 23:22.984
why don't you stay here
and play with your balls?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.277
Perfect, yeah.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.863
-Finally, a plan I can get behind.
-I can imagine.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.574
Yeah, good luck
looking for your… treasure.

23:29.658 --> 23:30.992
I mean, shield generator.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.744
I mean, made-up bullshit.

23:32.828 --> 23:33.870
Thank you.

23:34.496 --> 23:37.040
I'm starting to worry
Dustin might be wrong this time.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.420
I mean, this place is dead.

23:42.879 --> 23:46.716
I dunno. The whole thing
just seems… increasingly unlikely.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.718
Well, we're here now.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.721
Might as well search the place.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.020
Hey.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.774
Did I do something…

24:03.400 --> 24:05.444
to piss you off or something?

24:05.527 --> 24:07.154
What are you talking about?

24:07.237 --> 24:08.613
I don't know. There's a tone.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.073
-A tone?
-Yeah.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.909
-Okay.
-See, that was it. The tone.

24:12.993 --> 24:18.248
Yeah, well, now there's a tone
because you're being ridiculous.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.544
Yeah, well, was I being ridiculous
downstairs also?

24:22.627 --> 24:26.506
Oh, you mean when you and Steve
started up your macho crap again?

24:26.590 --> 24:31.052
Wait, no, you mean when Steve asked you
to go with him, and you hesitated.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.598
Um, actually, I said
we should stick to the usual.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.933
Yeah, after you hesitated.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.268
I didn't hesitate.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.187
I know you, Nancy. You hesitated.

24:41.396 --> 24:44.399
Okay. So what if I did, which I didn't?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.109
It doesn't matter.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.111
My sister is missing.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.822
Yeah, which is exactly why it does matter.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.867
After everything that has happened,

24:53.950 --> 24:55.285
that is happening,

24:55.368 --> 24:57.579
I'm scared, Nancy, okay?

24:57.662 --> 24:59.414
I'm really scared.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.501
I don't know
what's on the other side of any of this.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.127
But what I do know

25:04.211 --> 25:06.963
is that if we wanna stand a chance
of surviving this,

25:07.047 --> 25:08.757
all right, we need to be a team.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.383
A team like we used to be.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.969
We are still a team.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.054
No, we're not.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.306
Not anymore.

25:16.389 --> 25:20.769
So, what, you wanna solve
all of our relationship issues here?

25:20.852 --> 25:24.231
-In Hawkins Lab? In the Upside Down?
-No. No, Nancy.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.359
I just want you
to stop running away from me.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.528
Start being honest with me.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.404
Oh, and that's what you've been?

25:32.656 --> 25:33.698
Honest with me?

25:35.450 --> 25:36.660
Yeah.

25:36.743 --> 25:39.120
Yeah, I've been honest with you.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.039
-You hesitated.
-No, I didn't.

25:41.122 --> 25:44.501
I know you, Jonathan, and that hesitation
was the size of a Mack Truck.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.557
What are you doing?

26:41.224 --> 26:42.183
Jonathan!

26:45.979 --> 26:47.230
What the hell?

26:48.064 --> 26:49.608
What is it?

26:50.609 --> 26:53.862
Is it too late to take back what I said
about Dustin's theory?

27:01.703 --> 27:04.998
Nancy, Jonathan, do you copy? Over.

27:06.082 --> 27:10.128
We are at the church, and we are wondering
where the hell you are.

27:10.211 --> 27:11.254
You copy?

27:13.173 --> 27:14.215
Jonathan!

27:15.258 --> 27:17.260
Nancy, do you copy?

27:18.219 --> 27:19.429
Come on, guys.

27:19.512 --> 27:22.057
After you
and your policeman came all this way,

27:22.724 --> 27:26.478
it must have been quite the surprise
finding me instead of Henry.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.937
I'm sorry, Kali.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.066
I'm sorry for not finding you sooner.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.026
You couldn't have known.

27:33.109 --> 27:36.738
I have a bath, a tank at home.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.368
I can search far, even here.

27:42.577 --> 27:46.122
I think I was afraid to look for you.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.542
How much did you know about Henry?

27:49.626 --> 27:52.337
Everything, except…

27:54.464 --> 27:56.424
that he was still alive.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.260
Help me find him.

28:00.428 --> 28:01.429
Kill him.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.472
Then what?

28:02.555 --> 28:04.182
It ends.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.935
We can finally live. We can really live.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.520
That's just a dream, Jane.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.105
It doesn't have to be.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.734
I had the same… dream.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.696
That I could put a stop to all this,

28:19.364 --> 28:20.490
that I could…

28:22.325 --> 28:24.327
heal our wound.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.711
But they found me.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.797
Found my friends.

28:35.880 --> 28:36.965
No!

28:37.549 --> 28:38.508
They killed them.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.469
And they took me.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.099
I didn't understand why I was still alive.

29:28.183 --> 29:33.104
I thought maybe this doctor
was hired to torture me.

29:33.688 --> 29:35.440
But this was not about revenge.

29:36.274 --> 29:39.110
Dr. Kay needed me.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.905
She needed my blood.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.784
And her need was endless.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.123
She just kept taking…

29:53.374 --> 29:54.459
and taking.

29:55.293 --> 30:00.381
And I began to think of her
as a kind of vampire.

30:02.425 --> 30:06.638
I don't know how long I was there.
They had me drugged.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.808
All I knew was I needed to get out.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.185
And the only way out…

30:13.102 --> 30:14.187
was death.

30:19.108 --> 30:21.903
Dr. Kay thought she had stopped my tricks

30:21.986 --> 30:26.366
with that… awful sound of hers.

30:32.413 --> 30:35.041
But not all tricks require powers.

30:47.428 --> 30:50.974
If I had known
what was on the other side of that door,

30:52.058 --> 30:53.935
I never would have left.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.823
We thought of that. He must've made it.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.825
-What were they doing?
-I was playing…

31:08.908 --> 31:10.076
Go away, dipshit!

31:10.159 --> 31:12.161
You read my mind, numb nuts!

31:12.996 --> 31:16.374
Derek, what are you doing?
You're not allowed to go in the woods.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.458
It's against the rules.

31:17.542 --> 31:21.254
According to who, Mr. Rogers?
He can suck my fat one!

31:24.048 --> 31:25.925
-Mr. Whatsit!
-Mr. Whatsit!

31:26.009 --> 31:28.303
-Derek went in the woods!
-Mr. Whatsit!

31:33.808 --> 31:35.768
What if Henry catches Derek?

31:35.852 --> 31:38.313
You think he'll hurt him? Or worse?

31:38.396 --> 31:40.690
As long as Derek makes it to the cave,
he's safe.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.400
We just need Henry to take the bait.

31:42.483 --> 31:45.570
How long is it gonna take
to find the exit?

31:45.653 --> 31:46.988
Let's hope not long.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.824
Right, it's just you had your friend Kate
to guide you, and--

31:49.908 --> 31:53.202
All I've been doing for the past two years
is moving through this maze.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.454
I'm all the guide we need.

31:54.537 --> 31:56.331
Once we find his first memory of you,

31:56.414 --> 31:58.666
we follow the memory trail
to the night he captured you.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.253
And if I'm right,
the exit to the real world will be there.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.547
And then we escape Camazotz.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.633
Then we escape Camazotz.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.485
Hey, so, um, I realize,

32:25.568 --> 32:27.737
and I know
that I've waited just long enough

32:27.820 --> 32:29.072
to make this super awkward,

32:29.781 --> 32:32.700
but I never thanked you
for saving my life,

32:32.784 --> 32:36.120
which is, you know,
kind of, sort of a big deal.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.205
Especially to me.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.166
You're welcome.

32:40.249 --> 32:43.211
I… I… I mean, I should be thanking you.

32:43.294 --> 32:45.588
Thanking me? Why?

32:45.672 --> 32:49.634
For talking to me about Tammy
and… and your life.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.678
It was… It was so…

32:52.303 --> 32:53.262
helpful.

32:53.346 --> 32:55.723
Me? Talking?

32:56.641 --> 32:57.934
Helpful?

32:58.017 --> 32:59.894
Someone should really tell my mother.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.356
So…

33:04.023 --> 33:10.613
after… after this Tammy
and this whole tape epiphany,

33:10.697 --> 33:13.783
is that when you and Vickie started to…

33:13.866 --> 33:15.159
No, no, no. Um…

33:16.035 --> 33:19.288
I mean, I never would have had the guts
to talk to Vic back then.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.499
I was finally cool with myself,

33:21.582 --> 33:24.669
but sharing that part of myself with

33:24.752 --> 33:26.671
someone else,
that was a whole other thing.

33:27.505 --> 33:28.965
But eventually, I…

33:30.383 --> 33:32.719
I did it. You know, I told someone.

33:34.554 --> 33:35.930
Looks like we're all set.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.516
But…

33:39.267 --> 33:40.351
Wait.

33:40.435 --> 33:44.313
-But… But who did you tell?
-Oh. The obvious. Steve.

33:44.897 --> 33:46.274
Wait, what?

33:46.357 --> 33:50.528
Robin, I… I mean, I don't understand.
I mean, not the same…

33:50.611 --> 33:52.697
As in your Steve, like Steve…

33:52.780 --> 33:55.491
Steve "The Hair" Harrington,
my once sworn enemy.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.953
All right, watch out!

34:04.333 --> 34:05.334
That's good!

34:06.836 --> 34:11.549
But wait, Robin. I mean, I like Steve.
I just… I don't understand. He seems…

34:11.632 --> 34:13.092
Like a bonkers choice?

34:13.676 --> 34:15.303
-Yeah.
-Believe me, I know.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.639
To be fair, we had just been injected
with truth serum by evil Russians,

34:18.723 --> 34:21.267
which is kind of like liquid courage
on steroids.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.561
Really, drugs or not,

34:23.644 --> 34:28.608
just saying it out loud to someone
and hearing him be cool with it, you know?

34:28.691 --> 34:30.359
It's like this weight lifted.

34:31.444 --> 34:34.072
And, you know,
if I hadn't have told Steve,

34:34.155 --> 34:37.325
then I probably wouldn't have had
the courage to open up to Vickie about it,

34:37.408 --> 34:39.535
and probably wouldn't be talking
to you about it either.

34:39.619 --> 34:42.121
You know, you're only
audience member number three.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.499
I'm hoping to double my audience
by the end of this year,

34:44.582 --> 34:48.586
but that's only if you out-sorcerer
the sorcerer, and we don't all die.

34:50.505 --> 34:55.134
You don't by any chance
have any of that truth serum left, do you?

34:57.386 --> 34:58.387
Holy shit!

35:01.099 --> 35:02.100
Step back!

35:07.396 --> 35:10.024
This is it. This is where I woke up.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.986
Good. So, look for anything
that's out of place.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.447
It'll be hidden. Hard to find, but…

35:17.448 --> 35:18.533
There.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.493
Oh.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.537
Or not hard.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.895
It's just a memory.
Whatever's down there, it can't hurt you.

36:14.797 --> 36:17.216
I don't understand. This was Halloween.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.051
I hadn't met Henry yet.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.596
Just because you didn't see him
doesn't mean he wasn't here.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.687
Hey, remember…

36:29.770 --> 36:30.813
Just a memory.

36:30.897 --> 36:31.898
Mm-hmm.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.448
There should be another memory close by.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.242
Do you know
when you first actually met Henry?

36:45.119 --> 36:48.372
Holly, I need you to focus, okay?
When did you first meet him?

36:48.456 --> 36:50.583
After school, I think.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.585
Okay, where at school exactly?

36:53.502 --> 36:54.503
The library.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.214
Library.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.720
I used to live in this house.

37:24.283 --> 37:25.201
Bingo.

37:30.831 --> 37:32.708
I absolutely adore that book.

37:34.669 --> 37:35.670
Hello.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.089
My name is Henry.

37:38.631 --> 37:39.715
What's yours?

37:47.223 --> 37:48.599
Come on, man.

37:50.643 --> 37:51.852
Piece of shit.

37:54.772 --> 37:57.733
-Really? You're actually playing in here?
-I'm just following orders, dude.

37:58.317 --> 38:01.153
Judging by your pissy look, I assume
you didn't find the shield generator.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.114
-It's here somewhere.
-But you didn't find it.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.365
Yeah, not on this floor.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.533
So you were wrong.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.745
-You would just love that, wouldn't you?
-No, I'm just stating a fact.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.039
No, you're gloating.
Despite the fact that if I am wrong,

38:12.123 --> 38:14.959
we don't reach past the wall,
and don't find Holly and the other kids.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.752
Do you understand
how selfish you're being?

38:16.836 --> 38:19.380
Me? Selfish? You wanna talk about selfish?

38:19.463 --> 38:21.340
How about
when we finally reach Hop and El,

38:21.424 --> 38:24.510
we promptly ditch them
to pursue this bullshit theory of yours?

38:24.593 --> 38:27.596
Not to mention, you're the reason
that we lost contact with them

38:27.680 --> 38:29.015
because of your no-show at the crawl.

38:29.098 --> 38:32.935
So this whole mess is actually your fault.
And I haven't heard so much as a sorry.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.813
Shit. Again, it's not like
I just didn't show up. I was attacked.

38:35.896 --> 38:38.065
No, you wanted a fight,
and that's what you got.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.775
Just look at your face.

38:39.859 --> 38:43.654
You've done some stupid shit in the past,
but this? Man, this takes the cake.

38:43.738 --> 38:44.989
You wanna talk about dumb shit?

38:45.072 --> 38:46.741
How about chasing
somebody else's girlfriend

38:46.824 --> 38:47.825
while the world is ending?

38:47.908 --> 38:52.330
Nancy is a friend. She's a friend, okay?

38:52.413 --> 38:54.874
You remember what that's like?
Having friends?

38:54.957 --> 38:58.461
Yeah, I do. I remember
what it was like to have a good friend,

38:58.544 --> 39:02.298
a real friend who actually believed in me,
and who was actually kind to me.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.050
-Aha! Aha!
-What? What?

39:04.133 --> 39:06.844
There we go. What this has all been about,
really, is Eddie.

39:06.927 --> 39:09.013
All your bullshit, pushing everyone away,

39:09.096 --> 39:11.432
it's because no one could ever be
as perfect as he was.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.101
He wasn't perfect,
but at least he knew that, unlike you.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.438
He was never fake. He didn't care
what other people thought about him.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.357
He was just himself.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.693
And you know what? He was the smartest,
kindest person I've ever met.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.237
And he would've solved this
in 30 seconds flat.

39:25.321 --> 39:28.616
If I'm such a goddamn idiot,
how come I'm the one still standing here?

39:29.492 --> 39:31.327
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

39:31.410 --> 39:32.703
That night,

39:33.871 --> 39:36.540
I told you not to be heroes.
I told both of you.

39:37.291 --> 39:38.501
What did Eddie do?

39:39.543 --> 39:41.754
-He charged into a swarm of killer bats.
-To save my life.

39:41.837 --> 39:42.880
He saved no one.

39:42.963 --> 39:45.299
-He saved everyone!
-You can keep telling yourself that.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.593
But deep down,
the reason you're so goddamn pissed

39:47.676 --> 39:49.387
is because you know the truth.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.014
Eddie wanted to play hero,

39:52.848 --> 39:56.060
and he made a dumb call,
and he got himself killed.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.436
Shut up!

40:00.439 --> 40:02.191
No! What the hell, man?

40:02.274 --> 40:04.610
What are you doing, man? Stop it.

40:04.693 --> 40:07.029
Hey! Stop!

40:07.113 --> 40:09.156
Stop it, man! Henderson!

40:09.240 --> 40:12.451
Hey! Hey! Henderson!
Hey, what are you doing?

40:12.535 --> 40:14.954
Calm down! Calm-- Henderson, Henderson!

40:15.996 --> 40:18.374
Jesus! You're gonna hurt yourself, man!

40:23.421 --> 40:24.880
All right, Dustin.

40:28.467 --> 40:32.596
Enough, man! Enough! Enough! Stop!

40:37.560 --> 40:38.686
You know what, man?

40:41.147 --> 40:42.231
I'm done.

40:47.736 --> 40:48.904
I'm done.

40:50.072 --> 40:52.700
All right, yeah, just go
and crawl back to Nance!

40:53.659 --> 40:54.660
You dumb,

40:55.619 --> 40:57.204
fake asshole!

41:47.087 --> 41:48.422
What the hell?

41:54.637 --> 41:56.013
What do you think?

41:57.097 --> 42:01.477
Maybe some kind of nuclear explosion,
like Chernobyl?

42:02.019 --> 42:03.020
Yeah.

42:03.896 --> 42:07.650
That's what I was thinking,
but in a nuclear explosion,

42:08.275 --> 42:11.737
everything would burn.
It wouldn't just melt like this.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.115
Do you notice the air?

42:16.450 --> 42:18.702
-The air?
-Yeah.

42:19.703 --> 42:20.746
Look, it's clean.

42:21.288 --> 42:22.456
There's no spores.

42:27.586 --> 42:28.963
Whatever happened here,

42:29.838 --> 42:31.048
Vecna's behind it.

42:31.632 --> 42:32.967
Had to be.

42:33.050 --> 42:34.301
Dark magic.

42:37.721 --> 42:39.056
Whoa! Shit!

42:42.268 --> 42:45.187
-Okay. All right, okay.
-Yeah.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.940
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

42:48.023 --> 42:49.024
Okay.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.777
-Oh, Jesus.
-Oh.

42:53.612 --> 42:54.613
Christ.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.658
What the hell happened here?

43:07.042 --> 43:09.128
You just had to pick up, didn't you?

43:30.983 --> 43:33.319
I never knew
how close I was to making it out.

43:33.402 --> 43:35.904
Now, thanks to you
and your policeman, I do.

43:38.490 --> 43:39.742
Ten yards.

43:40.826 --> 43:42.703
Ten yards.

43:43.746 --> 43:47.207
One more corner,
and my life would have been…

43:48.125 --> 43:49.335
different.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.047
Gun!

44:02.556 --> 44:04.850
Open the goddamn door!

44:05.601 --> 44:06.727
Open up!

44:07.311 --> 44:11.190
In my search for a way out,
I found something else.

44:12.316 --> 44:14.568
I found the answer

44:15.611 --> 44:18.614
to why I was there.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.086
They were infusing her

44:34.004 --> 44:35.798
and her unborn child

44:37.383 --> 44:39.009
with my blood.

44:42.513 --> 44:47.059
And it was killing her,
along with her unborn child.

44:48.977 --> 44:50.396
Help.

45:06.745 --> 45:10.666
I don't know how many there were,
but they were all sick.

45:11.542 --> 45:12.543
Dying.

45:27.474 --> 45:29.393
I… I… I don't understand.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.688
Pregnant women.

45:34.356 --> 45:36.066
A secret government program.

45:36.150 --> 45:40.362
Does that not remind you of anything?

45:42.489 --> 45:43.407
Mama.

45:58.297 --> 46:01.258
It was not drugs
that gave us our powers, Jane.

46:02.176 --> 46:03.260
It was Henry.

46:08.515 --> 46:12.352
Now, Dr. Kay is trying
to restart Papa's program,

46:12.436 --> 46:15.564
but my blood is not working.

46:16.356 --> 46:17.483
Not as Henry's did.

46:18.692 --> 46:24.656
The truth is, Papa's children
were always just pale imitations of Henry.

46:25.365 --> 46:26.825
Only one of us…

46:28.076 --> 46:29.578
was truly like him.

46:30.454 --> 46:34.541
This is just an illusion.
This isn't real. None of this is real.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.419
Why do you think
Kay is so desperate to find you?

46:37.503 --> 46:41.590
They will find you,
and they will create more! More like you!

46:43.050 --> 46:43.926
Like Henry.

46:53.727 --> 46:55.521
There are no happy endings, Jane.

46:56.104 --> 46:57.397
Not for us.

47:01.026 --> 47:03.278
Hey, it's okay. It's just me.

47:04.112 --> 47:05.447
It's just me.

47:30.764 --> 47:32.975
Northwest. Northwest.

47:33.058 --> 47:35.102
A little lost, are we?

47:49.867 --> 47:51.159
Who gave you this map?

47:51.243 --> 47:52.744
Your mom!

47:52.828 --> 47:53.996
Look at me!

47:54.997 --> 47:56.790
You lie to me again,

47:57.624 --> 48:02.379
and I will kill your fool of a father…

48:04.715 --> 48:07.384
your snake of a mother…

48:10.304 --> 48:14.141
and that bitch of a sister too.

48:18.270 --> 48:20.480
-All right, my dears. Playtime's over.
-Come on.

48:21.648 --> 48:22.608
Come on.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.319
What is with that grumpy face?

48:25.402 --> 48:28.822
Come on. We have books to read,
art to create,

48:28.906 --> 48:31.617
wisdom to unlock.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.246
Are you positive nothing else happened

48:36.330 --> 48:37.956
-before the Demo showed up?
-Yes.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.750
Walk me through everything again
from the beginning.

48:39.833 --> 48:41.668
-I've told you already.
-Tell me again.

48:44.087 --> 48:46.548
Mary and I were at the merry-go-round.

48:47.132 --> 48:49.509
-Stop, Derek! Get off! Stop!
-Hold on tight!

48:49.593 --> 48:54.181
Derek was a dipshit to us, like usual,
and then Henry called me over there.

48:54.264 --> 48:56.391
He told me he'd protect me
from the monsters,

48:56.475 --> 48:59.186
and I didn't see him again
until the field.

48:59.269 --> 49:01.772
I just got in trouble
for having an imaginary friend,

49:01.855 --> 49:05.817
and Mom got all weird,
and she got into a big fight with Dad.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.080
What is it?

49:18.163 --> 49:20.666
That's wrong. It should be yellow.

49:20.749 --> 49:21.750
Stop!

49:39.184 --> 49:41.687
Mom! Mom!

49:41.770 --> 49:43.188
Mom! Dad!

49:43.271 --> 49:46.233
Please, please let me go! Let me go!

49:47.901 --> 49:50.445
Mom! Mom! Mom!

49:50.529 --> 49:55.200
Help! Help, Mom! Mom! Dad!

49:57.786 --> 49:59.037
Get back!

49:59.538 --> 50:00.956
Holly. Holly.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.000
You all right?

50:05.085 --> 50:06.503
I don't know.

50:07.337 --> 50:08.338
I don't know. I feel…

50:08.422 --> 50:09.756
Scared?

50:09.840 --> 50:11.633
We're close to the final memory.

50:13.218 --> 50:16.346
You might start to… feel things,

50:16.430 --> 50:18.348
some things that you felt that night.

50:19.599 --> 50:20.767
I know I did.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.147
But it's just like an echo.

50:25.814 --> 50:26.982
It's a good sign.

50:27.899 --> 50:29.818
It means you're almost home.

50:35.032 --> 50:36.658
Come on. Follow me.

50:45.083 --> 50:47.711
You said I'm almost home.

50:49.171 --> 50:51.298
But you're coming too, right?

50:51.381 --> 50:53.800
Mmm. No.
I'm gonna stick around here, actually.

50:54.968 --> 50:57.179
Of course. Are you kidding?

50:57.262 --> 50:58.138
Come on.

51:03.143 --> 51:04.686
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

51:04.770 --> 51:05.937
Cables won't reach the ground.

51:06.021 --> 51:08.857
We're gonna have to do
our little science experiment up here.

51:15.572 --> 51:17.908
Okay. Take it really slow.

51:20.243 --> 51:21.203
Okay.

51:23.413 --> 51:25.332
-Ready? Ready?
-Yeah.

51:25.415 --> 51:26.708
Ready!

51:48.355 --> 51:49.898
Okay, we're all set.

51:55.695 --> 51:58.115
If anything happens,
you just get out of there.

51:58.198 --> 51:59.783
I will. I promise.

51:59.866 --> 52:02.953
And if shit really hits the fan,
we just crank up the voltage,

52:03.036 --> 52:06.039
burn out the particles,
unplug him from the hive.

52:08.625 --> 52:10.293
-Mom?
-Yeah?

52:10.877 --> 52:12.671
Thank you for trusting me.

52:15.048 --> 52:16.508
Kill the bastard.

52:17.884 --> 52:19.594
All right. You got this.

52:23.348 --> 52:24.808
Light her up, Frankenstein.

52:24.891 --> 52:26.685
It's pronounced "Fronkensteen!"

53:07.184 --> 53:10.145
It's working. It's working!

53:10.228 --> 53:11.730
We're at 50%!

53:16.067 --> 53:17.027
Come on. Come on.

53:42.093 --> 53:42.928
Dipshit!

53:44.679 --> 53:46.765
Where is he? Where's Mr. Whatsit?

53:46.848 --> 53:48.266
I think I'm Derek.

53:49.142 --> 53:51.561
-Derek?
-He's with the others.

53:52.562 --> 53:55.023
-The other lost children.
-What about Holly?

53:55.607 --> 53:57.442
-Do you see Holly?
-No.

53:57.525 --> 54:01.655
Spit it out, dipshit!
Mr. Whatsit, where is he?

54:01.738 --> 54:03.323
Searching for Holly.

54:03.406 --> 54:06.952
Henry is searching for her.

54:07.035 --> 54:10.038
Holly would never run away.
She isn't like that. You're lying.

54:10.121 --> 54:13.124
I'm not lying. A monster tricked her.

54:13.208 --> 54:16.294
It's disguised as a girl
with weird clothes and red hair.

54:16.378 --> 54:17.379
She calls herself…

54:17.462 --> 54:18.296
Max.

54:18.380 --> 54:20.090
Wait. What about Max?

54:20.173 --> 54:21.216
She's with Holly.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.594
But Vecna… Vecna's hunting them.

54:35.855 --> 54:37.274
I just stood there.

54:38.775 --> 54:40.652
Why didn't I fight? Why didn't I help her?

54:40.735 --> 54:41.987
That was old Holly.

54:42.862 --> 54:43.738
You would now.

54:46.700 --> 54:49.953
No! Mommy! Mommy, please!

54:50.745 --> 54:51.746
Come on.

55:13.685 --> 55:14.978
What is that?

55:16.271 --> 55:17.188
Our exit.

55:17.772 --> 55:19.774
It doesn't look like an exit.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.073
You sure you're not a monster?

55:27.907 --> 55:28.908
Pretty sure.

55:37.667 --> 55:39.544
I told you, Holly.

55:49.220 --> 55:50.972
Never go into the woods.

55:55.643 --> 55:58.229
-Shit!
-Max, he's coming! No!

55:58.313 --> 55:59.689
Holly, give me that.

56:00.815 --> 56:02.359
Max, hurry!

56:25.048 --> 56:26.174
Max!

56:29.677 --> 56:31.846
At long last,

56:33.139 --> 56:35.642
the fox is caught.

56:36.643 --> 56:38.144
Stop!

56:51.825 --> 56:52.742
Max!

57:17.142 --> 57:18.393
It is working.

57:26.401 --> 57:27.277
Sorcerer.

57:30.989 --> 57:32.907
Max! Are you all right?

57:42.125 --> 57:43.751
-Max!
-Max!

57:43.835 --> 57:44.961
If you…

57:45.044 --> 57:48.006
…can hear me, you…

57:48.089 --> 57:50.175
-…need…
-…to run!

57:51.468 --> 57:55.680
Run!

58:18.119 --> 58:18.995
Get out.

58:20.580 --> 58:21.748
Get out!

58:22.957 --> 58:23.917
Get out!

58:25.001 --> 58:26.461
What is happening?

58:26.544 --> 58:27.504
Get out!

58:28.588 --> 58:30.215
Get out!

58:34.719 --> 58:36.513
-Will, can you hear me?
-Come on!

58:36.596 --> 58:37.430
I'm right here.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.724
-Come on, Will.
-Crank it! Crank it!

59:06.376 --> 59:07.961
Will, come back to us.

59:08.044 --> 59:09.879
Come back to us, Will. Will!

59:09.963 --> 59:11.881
Will, come back to me!

59:11.965 --> 59:13.883
-Come back!
-Will! Will!

59:20.515 --> 59:21.516
Whoa!

59:24.894 --> 59:26.771
Just more of this melted shit.

59:41.995 --> 59:42.996
Jonathan.

59:44.747 --> 59:45.790
You see this?

59:47.917 --> 59:49.002
See what?

59:49.877 --> 59:50.878
My light.

59:51.671 --> 59:52.672
Watch.

59:56.467 --> 59:57.677
Whoa.

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:11.316
Something's there.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:45.767
Dark magic.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.021
Oh, God.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.442
Dustin, Steve, you guys copy?

01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:56.611
We found the shield generator.
Do you copy?

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.782
Jonathan, it's Dustin. Do you copy?

01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:04.994
I can't hear you. Can you hear me?
We have found the shield generator.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:07.664
Just listen to me, okay?
Don't do anything.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:08.873
Don't touch it!

01:01:08.956 --> 01:01:10.208
Don't touch anything!

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:11.793
Shit!

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.341
They're out of range.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:23.262
Well, I guess they'll miss the show.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:38.069
Jonathan!

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:41.572
If you can hear me, I was wrong!

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:44.784
The shield generator,
it's not a shield generator!

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:48.121
It's not dark magic! It's something else!

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:50.081
Jonathan! Nancy!

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:57.839
Jonathan! Nancy!
If you destroy it, you will die!

01:01:57.922 --> 01:02:03.010
We will die! Holly will die!
Everyone will die! Do you copy?

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:06.389
You sure about this?

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:10.518
No.
