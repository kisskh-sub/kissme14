1970, TOKYO, JAPAN

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.712
Take
the first flight out to Fukuoka tomorrow.

00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:27.424
When you get there,
someone will be waiting for you.

00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:32.763
And who would that be?

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:37.476
I want you to meet Ikeda Yuji
and hand over this briefcase.

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:46.234
Ikeda Yuji?

00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:48.987
Your business partner.

00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:53.325
The moment you
fall out of favor with Ikeda,

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:55.619
the deal's over.

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:05.545
A BUSINESSMAN

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:13.887
My name is Matsuda Kenji,

00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:17.140
a businessman on a work trip to Fukuoka.

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.689
My job is to deliver this briefcase safely
to Ikeda Yuji.

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:35.075
Hey, are you not feeling well?

00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:36.868
Are you scared to fly?

00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:38.995
- I'm not scared.
- Hmm?

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.373
It's just my first time.

00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:45.460
Everyone feels that way
their first time flying.

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:50.382
During takeoff,
your ears might pop a little.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.094
It helps if you chew gum.

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:58.765
What do you say?

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:00.350
Thank you.

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:02.936
Good for you.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.443
Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen. This flight is scheduled…

00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:12.362
Japan Airways 351 cleared for takeoff.

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:13.739
Runway 33.

00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:14.823
Stabilized.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:17.159
…and arrive at Fukuoka Itazuke Airport

00:02:17.242 --> 00:02:18.243
at around 8:50 a.m.

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:19.828
We will be taking off shortly.

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:24.166
Please be seated
and fasten your seat belt.

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.959
We will be taking off shortly.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:30.464
Please be seated
and fasten your seat belt.

00:02:32.424 --> 00:02:34.009
Set takeoff thrust.

00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:35.260
Set takeoff thrust.

00:02:35.844 --> 00:02:36.887
Thrust set.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.013
Check.

00:02:51.818 --> 00:02:54.863
Japan Airways 351, Haneda departure.

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:58.700
Contact Tokyo Control 134.1.

00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:00.202
Good day.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.041
Sure.

00:03:12.172 --> 00:03:13.882
Would you like something to drink?

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:16.051
- Cola, please.
- Sure.

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.847
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:23.183
Oh, excuse me.

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:29.523
Would you like something to drink?

00:04:02.013 --> 00:04:03.181
Good morning.

00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:11.773
Nobody move!

00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:13.525
Don't move!

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:15.902
Move!

00:04:16.486 --> 00:04:17.946
Don't move, or you're dead!

00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:20.365
Don't move!

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.535
Mayday, mayday,
hijacking, hijacking.

00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:25.120
- This is Japan Air…
- Stop.

00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:28.415
We're the Revolutionary Army
of the Communist League.

00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:29.833
Please don't kill me! Please!

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.585
Shut up and keep your heads down!

00:04:32.544 --> 00:04:33.837
Heads down!

00:04:35.297 --> 00:04:37.632
We're going to North Korea.

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:39.968
- Shut up!
- Hey!

00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:41.386
Mom.

00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:44.598
Are we going to die?

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.143
Shut up!

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:49.227
It's okay.

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:52.856
You and your mom
will make it out of here safely.

00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:57.027
Shut up!

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.403
Japan Airways Flight 351,

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:03.700
a Japanese airliner that
left Tokyo Haneda Airport for Fukuoka

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.162
with 138 passengers and crew on board,
was hijacked midair.

00:05:09.247 --> 00:05:10.999
The hijackers were the Revolutionary Army,

00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:13.460
a radical leftist offshoot
of the Japanese Communist League,

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:15.587
calling themselves
the "Army for Revolutionary War."

00:05:16.338 --> 00:05:19.090
They returned to Japan
after military training in North Korea,

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:24.179
and hijacked a civilian airliner,
intent on launching a revolutionary war.

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:27.015
Heads down! Down!

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.740
MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT, JAPAN

00:06:28.785 --> 00:06:31.496
URGENT REPORT, AIRCRAFT HIJACKING

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:32.998
We're assessing the situation,

00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:35.542
- but it's not clear yet.
- Please hold on for a moment.

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:39.713
- Hey! No one answer the phone!
- Don't answer the phone!

00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:41.006
Hey, hang up! Hang up!

00:06:42.465 --> 00:06:46.011
We lost all contact
after the captain's distress signal.

00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:47.095
I see.

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:48.805
MINISTER OF TRANSPORT
MORIYAMA YOSHIRO

00:06:48.888 --> 00:06:50.598
So, what do you think we should do now?

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:52.809
VICE-MINISTER OF TRANSPORT
NATSUME JUNJI

00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:55.562
We should probably report this
to the Cabinet first.

00:06:55.645 --> 00:06:56.688
Right.

00:06:57.564 --> 00:07:00.275
Then let's draft a report right away.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.821
The Revolutionary Army boarded
the plane with loads of guns and knives

00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:06.573
with no trouble at all.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.118
Before that,
how about we notify the police first, sir?

00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:12.454
That's a good point too.

00:07:13.246 --> 00:07:18.376
But I'm not sure who we should call first,
Tokyo or Fukuoka police…

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.546
Back then, there were
no security checks before boarding.

00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:23.631
A manual for hijackings?

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:26.050
Guess we'll have to check
for precedent first, huh?

00:07:26.134 --> 00:07:28.428
There was no such thing.

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:31.055
Well,
the report should probably be addressed

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:32.807
to the Prime Minister, right?

00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:35.477
That's another thing we'll need to check.

00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:36.978
Good point.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.481
But…

00:07:41.107 --> 00:07:44.110
are we sure
there's been an actual hijacking?

00:07:44.694 --> 00:07:46.196
Yes, sir. It's confirmed.

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:52.994
Keep your heads down!

00:07:53.077 --> 00:07:55.246
Drop your hands, and you're done for!

00:07:55.747 --> 00:07:56.915
Keep your heads down!

00:07:58.082 --> 00:07:59.584
Turbulence.

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:01.419
We could go into a stall!

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:04.964
-Should we change course?
-What are you up to?

00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:07.675
The weather's getting worse,
and the aircraft is unstable.

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:11.429
If we don't act fast, we may have
to make an emergency landing.

00:08:11.513 --> 00:08:12.722
Then do something!

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:15.016
A hijacking and turbulence.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.020
In the middle of the total chaos,
the only relief was that

00:08:19.103 --> 00:08:22.982
Captain Honda Kunihiko was a veteran pilot

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:24.442
with over 10,000 flight hours.

00:08:24.526 --> 00:08:26.319
The aircraft has stabilized.

00:08:26.903 --> 00:08:28.780
This was supposed to be a domestic flight.

00:08:28.863 --> 00:08:30.698
We can't make it all the way to Pyongyang.

00:08:30.782 --> 00:08:33.785
Without more fuel,
we'll run out and crash halfway.

00:08:36.412 --> 00:08:38.957
Yes, the captain is right.

00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:42.836
For now, why don't we land
at Itazuke Airport as planned

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.213
and request refueling there?

00:08:48.091 --> 00:08:50.051
They're heading to Itazuke?

00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:51.594
Yes, sir.

00:08:51.678 --> 00:08:53.596
I thought they were headed to North Korea.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.265
Why are they flying to Itazuke?

00:08:55.849 --> 00:08:58.309
Ah. Why indeed?

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.437
Well, we should take measures.

00:09:01.521 --> 00:09:02.730
What kind of measures?

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.151
I mean…

00:09:11.156 --> 00:09:12.866
- Eh?
- Just as the captain intended,

00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:15.910
the plane landed safely at
its original destination, Itazuke Airport.

00:09:15.994 --> 00:09:17.370
ITAZUKE AIRPORT, FUKUOKA, JAPAN

00:09:17.453 --> 00:09:20.540
For a moment, it gave
the passengers some sort of hope

00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:22.500
that this nightmare might soon be over.

00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:24.878
At this point,
nothing has been confirmed.

00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:29.632
Uh, for now, our top priority is
the safety of the passengers.

00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:32.177
How many hijackers are on board?

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.470
Have any passengers
been killed or injured?

00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:35.805
When was the last communication?

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:37.140
Are the hijackers armed?

00:09:37.223 --> 00:09:40.852
-Is it true they're backed by someone?
-Are all the passengers unharmed?

00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:47.150
Like I said,

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:51.070
our top priority right now is
the safety of the passengers.

00:09:51.654 --> 00:09:52.989
We want you

00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:56.159
to fill the tanks,

00:09:57.076 --> 00:09:59.829
clear the runway,
and bring us the flight charts right now.

00:10:00.622 --> 00:10:02.916
If you don't give us what we want,

00:10:02.999 --> 00:10:05.877
we'll start killing
the passengers one by one!

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.713
How long would it take
to fill up the tanks?

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:11.716
Actually, if they're trying
to get to Pyongyang,

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:13.593
the fuel on board should be enough.

00:10:13.676 --> 00:10:16.262
What are you talking about?
That's not the point.

00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:19.432
If we want to negotiate,
we need to buy as much time as possible.

00:10:28.942 --> 00:10:30.109
Please don't shoot.

00:10:30.193 --> 00:10:32.362
I brought the flight charts you asked for.

00:10:32.445 --> 00:10:33.738
Here they are.

00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:35.198
Move!

00:10:41.913 --> 00:10:43.164
Damn it.

00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:44.624
You think we're idiots?

00:10:44.707 --> 00:10:47.460
No. There wasn't much time,
so we had to prepare them in a rush.

00:10:47.543 --> 00:10:48.962
What about the fuel?

00:10:49.045 --> 00:10:51.839
We're working on it now.
If you could give us a little more time…

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:02.475
One passenger every hour.

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:04.978
If you ignore our demands,

00:11:05.645 --> 00:11:06.980
we will kill them.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.481
Go on.

00:11:15.113 --> 00:11:16.114
Go!

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:17.615
Yes, sir.

00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:21.327
Hey, just drag one out first.

00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:24.205
What are you doing?
Not without Mr. Yamada's orders.

00:11:24.289 --> 00:11:26.374
The second-in-command gave the go-ahead.

00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:28.418
We agreed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed!

00:11:28.918 --> 00:11:31.754
If the passengers start panicking,
it'll be hard to control them.

00:11:31.838 --> 00:11:33.423
That's the kind of thing

00:11:33.506 --> 00:11:36.384
only weak, college-graduate types
like you worry about.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.928
What are you standing around for?

00:11:40.138 --> 00:11:42.348
Hey, you. Come here.

00:11:42.432 --> 00:11:44.350
- No, wait! Please don't kill me!
- Come on!

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:47.562
Yamagata!

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:50.315
Somebody help me!

00:11:59.907 --> 00:12:00.950
Shut up!

00:12:01.034 --> 00:12:03.036
You want to die in his place?

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:06.247
Takashi, do it!

00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:07.874
Do it!

00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:13.296
Who the hell are you?

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:21.679
You need to treat the hostages carefully
until the negotiations are over.

00:12:21.763 --> 00:12:24.307
Since their lives are tied to yours.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.154
Who the hell are you?
What do you think you're doing?

00:12:39.572 --> 00:12:43.159
Tell your leader I want a word with him.

00:13:02.804 --> 00:13:04.430
You think you can help us?

00:13:05.264 --> 00:13:07.266
How exactly?

00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:11.854
First, let the women, children,
and the elderly go.

00:13:12.522 --> 00:13:13.648
Why should we?

00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:15.983
What you want is a revolution, isn't it?

00:13:17.402 --> 00:13:22.490
As you know, a revolution
without public support is bound to fail.

00:13:23.282 --> 00:13:26.702
But terrorists who release
women and children win favor

00:13:26.786 --> 00:13:28.830
with the public and the press.

00:13:29.664 --> 00:13:32.959
If you make the first move,
all the criticism falls on the government.

00:13:33.543 --> 00:13:38.214
After that, whatever you do,
it's the government that takes the blame.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.135
In the end, they'll have no choice
but to let you take off.

00:13:44.178 --> 00:13:48.182
And you'll still have
over a hundred hostages.

00:13:49.642 --> 00:13:51.602
Not a bad bargain, is it?

00:13:53.688 --> 00:13:55.148
And then what?

00:13:56.232 --> 00:13:57.942
Once you reach Pyongyang,

00:13:58.025 --> 00:14:00.403
put the remaining passengers and crew
back on the plane

00:14:00.486 --> 00:14:01.863
and send them home to Japan.

00:14:02.947 --> 00:14:06.367
Then the press won't call you hijackers.

00:14:07.034 --> 00:14:10.246
They'll paint you as heroes
who pulled off a bold operation.

00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:12.957
Well, probably.

00:14:17.503 --> 00:14:20.006
We can't just send the plane back.

00:14:21.382 --> 00:14:24.135
We need to make
some kind of gesture to North Korea,

00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:27.221
or they won't take us in.

00:14:29.765 --> 00:14:31.142
I can provide that.

00:14:47.408 --> 00:14:48.451
That's…

00:14:49.452 --> 00:14:50.453
Mr. Yamada.

00:14:51.996 --> 00:14:53.039
I told you.

00:14:53.706 --> 00:14:55.458
I could help you.

00:14:57.585 --> 00:15:00.880
Take a chance and trust me.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.134
Do as I say, and you'll get what you want
without anyone getting hurt.

00:15:17.647 --> 00:15:19.398
It's opening!

00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:57.144
In the end, they did
what I told them and let 23 passengers go.

00:15:57.228 --> 00:15:59.146
Women, children, and the elderly.

00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:04.568
The meth in my briefcase was worth
nearly 90 million yen on the street,

00:16:04.652 --> 00:16:07.446
and word was all over Japan
that the big shots in Pyongyang

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.990
were crazy for the stuff.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.828
To these bastards, I was
like a jackpot that fell on their laps.

00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:15.746
They've released 23 passengers in total.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.832
Women, children, and the elderly.

00:16:17.915 --> 00:16:19.208
They really let them go?

00:16:19.292 --> 00:16:20.293
Yes, sir.

00:16:20.376 --> 00:16:21.627
But…

00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:24.839
they're saying if we don't supply fuel
and clear the runway immediately,

00:16:24.922 --> 00:16:27.008
they'll kill the rest of the passengers.

00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:28.884
- What?
- Kill them?

00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:31.804
-What are we going to do?
-This is a problem.

00:16:32.805 --> 00:16:33.931
This is bad.

00:16:34.015 --> 00:16:35.641
For now, give them what they want.

00:16:35.725 --> 00:16:37.643
The passengers' safety
is our top priority.

00:16:37.727 --> 00:16:38.728
What do we do?

00:16:44.483 --> 00:16:47.111
They're pulling back!
The fighter jets are moving!

00:16:49.238 --> 00:16:51.157
They're letting us take off.

00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:56.537
We're going to Pyongyang!

00:17:05.338 --> 00:17:07.173
They're fueling us up!

00:17:07.256 --> 00:17:09.842
We're going to Pyongyang!

00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:11.594
Let's go to North Korea!

00:17:16.474 --> 00:17:19.560
Why are you helping us?

00:17:20.061 --> 00:17:22.355
It's just better to handle things quietly.

00:17:23.731 --> 00:17:26.150
Nothing good comes
from making a lot of noise, does it?

00:17:27.276 --> 00:17:29.570
Who are you?

00:17:29.654 --> 00:17:30.821
As you can see,

00:17:31.822 --> 00:17:33.366
I'm just a businessman.

00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:35.993
When you say a businessman…

00:17:38.204 --> 00:17:40.331
you mean in this kind of business, huh?

00:17:40.956 --> 00:17:42.500
It's the best money-maker there is.

00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:44.335
Though it comes with its risks.

00:17:46.212 --> 00:17:47.588
Are you with the yakuza?

00:17:48.506 --> 00:17:49.507
No.

00:17:50.508 --> 00:17:52.677
They're more like business partners.

00:17:53.219 --> 00:17:54.261
Something like that.

00:18:00.017 --> 00:18:01.727
Can I bum a cigarette?

00:18:11.195 --> 00:18:12.613
Is that the last one?

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:18.911
We're basically in the same boat now.

00:18:19.495 --> 00:18:21.163
You can spare me a cigarette, no?

00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:32.717
Oh, boy. It's his last one.

00:18:46.439 --> 00:18:49.525
They say once you get on meth,
you can never quit.

00:18:49.608 --> 00:18:50.818
Have you tried it?

00:18:52.278 --> 00:18:54.989
If you're curious, why don't you
go ahead and try it now?

00:18:58.075 --> 00:19:00.077
We're ready to take off, sir.

00:19:11.922 --> 00:19:18.012
J, A, Y, 3, 5, 1.

00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:23.434
3, 8, 1, 1, 7.

00:19:35.613 --> 00:19:40.159
KOREA GIMPO AIRPORT RAPCON,

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.957
RAPCON is
US Air Force, no Korea!

00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:49.502
Sergeant Chae Jiseok
is going to be here soon, all right?

00:19:49.585 --> 00:19:52.087
He belongs to RAPCON.
Fucking let him deal with it.

00:19:52.922 --> 00:19:55.007
We're not going
to get our hands dirty here.

00:19:57.176 --> 00:19:58.177
Sir.

00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:03.432
You called for me, sir?

00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:13.984
As of this moment,
US Forces Korea will vacate RAPCON

00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:17.363
and take no part in any situation
that may arise going forward.

00:20:18.197 --> 00:20:21.033
Wait, I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand.

00:20:21.742 --> 00:20:23.577
Who's going to be in charge here then?

00:20:24.203 --> 00:20:25.204
Hey.

00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:27.540
Come here.

00:20:33.003 --> 00:20:35.214
Are you the chief controller?

00:20:36.131 --> 00:20:37.132
Yes.

00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:38.884
Rank and name!

00:20:39.677 --> 00:20:42.346
Yes, sir! Sergeant Chae Jiseok.

00:20:53.065 --> 00:20:54.108
Yes, sir.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.361
Yes, sir. Okay.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.321
Take it.

00:21:00.656 --> 00:21:01.782
Take it.

00:21:07.955 --> 00:21:10.916
KCIA Director here.
Are you the chief controller?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.001
Yes, sir!

00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:13.919
The KCIA.

00:21:14.003 --> 00:21:17.047
A state intelligence agency created by
the military regime that seized power

00:21:17.131 --> 00:21:18.883
in a coup to keep its grip on the country.

00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:22.219
Modeled after the US CIA, it operated
under the banner of anti-communism,

00:21:22.303 --> 00:21:24.513
handling national security,
intelligence gathering,

00:21:24.597 --> 00:21:25.890
and covert operations abroad.

00:21:25.973 --> 00:21:28.142
But the reality was different.

00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:33.314
Skirting the law, it terrorized the people
and wielded unchecked power.

00:21:34.023 --> 00:21:37.818
The KCIA was nothing more
than the President's personal guard.

00:21:38.444 --> 00:21:40.779
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

00:21:40.863 --> 00:21:42.406
These are the President's orders.

00:21:42.489 --> 00:21:44.950
In a little while,
a plane will cross over to our side.

00:21:45.451 --> 00:21:49.163
You must seize that plane
before Pyongyang does, no matter what.

00:21:49.246 --> 00:21:52.291
Under no circumstances should you let it
reach Pyongyang first.

00:21:52.374 --> 00:21:53.500
Understood?

00:21:53.584 --> 00:21:54.627
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:03.761
At last,
the plane left Itazuke Airport

00:22:03.844 --> 00:22:05.137
and headed for Pyongyang.

00:22:08.182 --> 00:22:10.601
But it was imperative that
we never reach Pyongyang

00:22:10.684 --> 00:22:12.686
as the Revolutionary Army wanted.

00:22:14.772 --> 00:22:18.233
It's better to die
than to end up in Pyongyang.

00:22:27.576 --> 00:22:29.828
The aircraft has entered our airspace.

00:22:31.538 --> 00:22:33.457
Any station, any station.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.085
This is Japan Airways 351.

00:22:36.835 --> 00:22:38.003
Japan Airways 351.

00:22:38.087 --> 00:22:40.172
This is Seoul Control, loud and clear.

00:22:41.173 --> 00:22:44.843
Seoul Control, this is Japan Airways 351.

00:22:45.678 --> 00:22:48.764
Uh, we need to land at Pyongyang Airport
in North Korea.

00:22:48.847 --> 00:22:50.432
Request any information.

00:22:50.933 --> 00:22:52.142
Standby one.

00:23:06.156 --> 00:23:08.117
We've got fighter jets following us.

00:23:09.159 --> 00:23:10.536
They're Korean Air Force.

00:23:12.454 --> 00:23:14.581
Japan Airways 351.

00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:17.001
Change frequency to 131.4.

00:23:30.389 --> 00:23:34.685
Pyongyang Control,
this is Japan Airways 351.

00:23:34.768 --> 00:23:35.978
How do you hear me?

00:23:36.478 --> 00:23:39.398
We want to land at Pyongyang Airport.

00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:40.899
Request information.

00:23:40.983 --> 00:23:46.321
Pyongyang Control, Pyongyang Control,
this is Japan Airways 351.

00:23:46.989 --> 00:23:47.990
Radio check.

00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:51.785
Pyongyang Control, Pyongyang Control.

00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:54.872
This is Japan Airways 351.

00:23:54.955 --> 00:23:56.248
Radio check.

00:23:59.334 --> 00:24:02.421
Pyongyang Control, Pyongyang Control,

00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:05.257
this is Japan Airways 351.

00:24:05.924 --> 00:24:07.176
Radio check.

00:24:22.483 --> 00:24:26.320
Japan Airways 351,
this is Pyongyang Control. Loud and clear.

00:24:26.403 --> 00:24:30.157
We control to Pyongyang Airport.
Heading 270. Maintain.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.867
Pyongyang just responded.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.494
Congratulations, Mr. Yamada!

00:24:34.953 --> 00:24:37.790
A few months prior, a flight
from Gangneung to Seoul was hijacked

00:24:37.873 --> 00:24:40.042
and taken to North Korea
by North Korean agents

00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:41.376
disguised as passengers.

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:46.632
Of the 50 people abducted,
39 returned through Panmunjom.

00:24:46.715 --> 00:24:49.093
But 11, including the captain
and several passengers,

00:24:49.176 --> 00:24:50.844
still remain detained in North Korea.

00:24:51.845 --> 00:24:54.348
Chae Jiseok had been thrown
into the invisible battlefield

00:24:54.431 --> 00:24:55.724
between the two Koreas.

00:24:55.808 --> 00:24:59.937
Pyongyang Control,
this is Japan Airways 351.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.856
Heading 270, maintain.

00:25:03.357 --> 00:25:04.858
Request further clearance.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.698
And now, this plane
is being hijacked all over again.

00:25:12.199 --> 00:25:13.992
The fighter jets are pulling away, sir!

00:25:20.874 --> 00:25:24.253
Japan Airways
351, this is Pyongyang Control.

00:25:24.336 --> 00:25:26.713
Turn left heading 200.

00:25:26.797 --> 00:25:28.257
Roger, Pyongyang Control.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.759
Heading 200.

00:25:38.267 --> 00:25:42.229
A double hijacking.
At Gimpo Airport's control tower,

00:25:42.312 --> 00:25:45.190
air traffic controller Chae Jiseok
intercepted the transmission

00:25:45.274 --> 00:25:47.484
bound for Pyongyang
and redirected the plane south.

00:25:47.568 --> 00:25:50.654
Japan Airways 351, Runway 32, right.

00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:53.615
Roger, Runway 32, right.

00:25:53.699 --> 00:25:56.243
Good afternoon, Japan Airways 351.

00:25:56.326 --> 00:25:57.619
Continue approach.

00:25:58.996 --> 00:26:02.082
GIMPO AIRPORT, KOREA

00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:04.793
From this moment,
this is Pyongyang Airport!

00:26:05.878 --> 00:26:10.007
Once the hijackers exit the plane,
capture them all alive.

00:26:11.008 --> 00:26:15.012
If they resist,
you may open fire immediately.

00:26:17.139 --> 00:26:18.432
Without them realizing,

00:26:18.515 --> 00:26:19.683
the aircraft passed over Pyongyang,

00:26:19.766 --> 00:26:23.228
crossed the West Sea,
and finally landed at Gimpo Airport.

00:26:42.581 --> 00:26:45.792
They cobbled together
a crowd of locals, students, and soldiers

00:26:45.876 --> 00:26:48.295
disguised as a North Korean
welcoming committee.

00:26:51.715 --> 00:26:56.136
They even went so far as to hang
North Korean flags on the terminal,

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.388
but the whole charade was clumsy at best.

00:27:02.351 --> 00:27:04.978
Sir, something's not right.

00:27:07.272 --> 00:27:08.273
Move!

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.073
As expected,

00:27:16.156 --> 00:27:18.116
the Revolutionary Army
sensed something was wrong.

00:27:18.825 --> 00:27:21.620
Alas, the grand operation
they had planned…

00:27:23.497 --> 00:27:24.498
Hey!

00:27:27.334 --> 00:27:28.335
You!

00:27:30.504 --> 00:27:32.756
Here, Seoul?

00:27:34.341 --> 00:27:35.425
Yes!

00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:38.095
…ended in failure.

00:27:40.472 --> 00:27:41.682
Do you want me to kill you?

00:27:41.765 --> 00:27:42.891
What the hell is this?

00:27:44.768 --> 00:27:47.521
Why are we in South Korea?

00:27:47.604 --> 00:27:48.605
I don't know.

00:27:48.689 --> 00:27:51.233
You don't know? I'm going to kill you!

00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:54.111
If you kill the captain,
who's going to fly the plane?

00:27:57.406 --> 00:27:59.700
What about Pyongyang?
Not going there anymore?

00:28:04.204 --> 00:28:05.622
I'm going to kill you.

00:28:05.706 --> 00:28:07.708
All I did was try to help you.

00:28:09.251 --> 00:28:11.336
Will you make it to Pyongyang
if you kill me?

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.297
Don't give me that crap.
I'm going to kill you right now.

00:28:14.381 --> 00:28:15.716
Calm down first.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.927
There's still a way
for you to get there safely.

00:28:19.011 --> 00:28:20.178
Shut up!

00:28:21.013 --> 00:28:24.057
I'm done falling for the words
of some Zainichi.

00:28:27.436 --> 00:28:29.229
You think I wouldn't notice?

00:28:30.605 --> 00:28:33.358
Zainichi like you reek, you know.

00:28:34.776 --> 00:28:37.446
That same stench you get
from pigs and dogs.

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:38.572
Stop.

00:28:41.408 --> 00:28:43.326
There's a way for us to get to Pyongyang?

00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:47.122
You have my word.

00:28:49.374 --> 00:28:52.294
I'll get you to Pyongyang safely.

00:28:53.253 --> 00:28:55.338
Are you willing to bet your life on that?

00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:58.633
I'll bet my life on it.

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:02.012
Japan,
closely monitoring the plane's movements,

00:29:02.095 --> 00:29:03.597
was thrown into complete chaos

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.558
and dispatched a delegation
to South Korea to assess the situation.

00:29:06.641 --> 00:29:09.061
I don't know how
the plane ended up landing here.

00:29:09.144 --> 00:29:13.648
But now that it's in our country, there is
no way we're sending it to Pyongyang.

00:29:13.732 --> 00:29:15.942
"There's no way
we're sending it to Pyongyang."

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:19.404
The mic. Mr. Jeong, the microphone switch.

00:29:19.488 --> 00:29:20.906
-What about it?
-The microphone.

00:29:20.989 --> 00:29:22.365
Right, sorry.

00:29:23.408 --> 00:29:27.120
Who'd want to send it
to Pyongyang? None of us wants that.

00:29:27.204 --> 00:29:29.081
"Who'd want to send it to Pyongyang?"

00:29:29.164 --> 00:29:30.624
But listen.

00:29:30.707 --> 00:29:33.001
With the passengers' lives at stake,

00:29:33.585 --> 00:29:36.797
we need to leave room for negotiation.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.258
So why did you let it
come here in the first place?

00:29:40.342 --> 00:29:42.094
This should've been handled in Japan!

00:29:42.177 --> 00:29:43.804
"It should've been handled in Japan."

00:29:43.887 --> 00:29:47.099
This really puts us
in a difficult position too,

00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:49.893
but the President's stance
is absolutely firm.

00:29:49.976 --> 00:29:51.937
"…is absolutely firm."

00:29:53.897 --> 00:29:56.316
We're well aware that public opinion

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:57.776
in South Korea isn't favorable

00:29:57.859 --> 00:29:59.861
because of the recent hijacking incident.

00:29:59.945 --> 00:30:03.156
But there are more than a hundred lives
on the line here.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.494
So shouldn't we approach this
from a humanitarian perspective

00:30:07.577 --> 00:30:09.037
rather than a political one?

00:30:10.747 --> 00:30:12.999
Look, it's not public opinion
we're concerned about.

00:30:13.083 --> 00:30:15.585
Our priority is the safety
of the South Korean aircraft

00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:17.379
and citizens still held in the North.

00:30:17.462 --> 00:30:19.714
We're not saying
you can't negotiate with them.

00:30:19.798 --> 00:30:21.508
We're saying sending it to Pyongyang is

00:30:21.591 --> 00:30:23.593
- absolutely out of the question.
- That's right…

00:30:26.012 --> 00:30:28.140
- Geez, what…
- That's right.

00:30:28.223 --> 00:30:31.601
After all, if we don't start
the engines from outside,

00:30:31.685 --> 00:30:34.187
the plane can't even take off.

00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:36.398
They're not some miracle workers,
are they?

00:30:36.481 --> 00:30:39.985
In the end,
they'll have no choice but to give in.

00:30:40.068 --> 00:30:42.779
The South Korean government never admitted

00:30:42.863 --> 00:30:44.739
that it had deliberately
diverted the plane.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.742
On that plane
are our citizens.

00:30:47.826 --> 00:30:49.870
Japanese citizens.

00:30:51.163 --> 00:30:54.332
They're completely innocent people,
just like you.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.712
We fully understand the position
of the South Korean government.

00:30:58.795 --> 00:31:02.465
But right now, please put
the passengers' lives

00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:05.343
and safety above all else.

00:31:05.427 --> 00:31:08.597
I sincerely urge you.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.432
The gap between the two sides was clear,

00:31:10.515 --> 00:31:12.434
and there was little sign of compromise.

00:31:15.187 --> 00:31:18.815
This is Japan Airways 351.

00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:21.026
We need air in the cabin.

00:31:21.902 --> 00:31:23.528
The engines have shut down,

00:31:23.612 --> 00:31:27.199
and all the power
and ventilation systems are down.

00:31:27.741 --> 00:31:31.036
Unless we get air
into the cabin immediately,

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:33.163
it will be difficult to breathe.

00:31:34.122 --> 00:31:35.332
I repeat.

00:31:36.708 --> 00:31:38.835
We need air in the cabin.

00:31:39.586 --> 00:31:41.796
The engines have shut down…

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.925
…and all the power
and ventilations are down.

00:31:45.592 --> 00:31:48.762
Unless we get air
into the cabin immediately,

00:31:48.845 --> 00:31:50.931
it will be difficult to breathe.

00:31:54.309 --> 00:31:55.936
This is Seoul Approach Control.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.188
Open the door.

00:31:58.855 --> 00:32:01.858
Once again, open the door.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.694
Like you said,

00:32:05.654 --> 00:32:08.865
we pinned all the blame
on the Japanese government.

00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:10.575
Good.

00:32:11.868 --> 00:32:15.872
The Japanese government is
probably trying to figure out a way

00:32:15.956 --> 00:32:19.125
to send you to Pyongyang
for the passengers' safety.

00:32:23.088 --> 00:32:25.090
The problem is
the South Korean government.

00:32:29.427 --> 00:32:31.721
They won't let you go that easily.

00:32:40.772 --> 00:32:41.773
I owe you one.

00:32:49.656 --> 00:32:51.199
So what's your plan?

00:32:52.784 --> 00:32:54.744
You need a justification.

00:33:00.292 --> 00:33:02.836
Let all the remaining passengers go.

00:33:02.919 --> 00:33:05.880
You bastard. You think
we're going to fall for that again?

00:33:10.135 --> 00:33:11.553
Hey.

00:33:12.387 --> 00:33:14.973
Who the hell are you, really?

00:33:15.557 --> 00:33:16.850
I told you.

00:33:17.434 --> 00:33:19.436
I'm a businessman.

00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:21.771
What are you playing at?

00:33:30.155 --> 00:33:33.408
All I want is to settle this quietly.

00:33:34.492 --> 00:33:36.286
Send you to Pyongyang

00:33:36.911 --> 00:33:38.663
and finish my business.

00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:41.624
We're not letting any more passengers go.

00:33:43.293 --> 00:33:46.379
If the South Korean government
doesn't accept our demands,

00:33:46.463 --> 00:33:48.548
we're killing them all!

00:33:48.631 --> 00:33:51.885
And of course,
we'll cut your head off first.

00:33:52.677 --> 00:33:53.762
Fine.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.016
Then let's do it another way.

00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:02.062
Bring me the briefcase I gave you.

00:34:02.645 --> 00:34:04.606
Inside is the answer

00:34:04.689 --> 00:34:07.525
to get you to Pyongyang.

00:35:56.801 --> 00:35:59.095
What was that?

00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:00.764
Was that a gunshot?

00:36:00.847 --> 00:36:03.141
What? We've got guns?

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.358
Put the gun down now.

00:36:16.613 --> 00:36:17.947
Otherwise,

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:19.824
we all die together.

00:36:21.826 --> 00:36:23.995
Go ahead.

00:36:28.792 --> 00:36:29.793
Come on, do it.

00:37:04.202 --> 00:37:06.079
They heard a gunshot
from inside the plane.

00:37:06.162 --> 00:37:07.997
They heard a gunshot
from inside the plane!

00:37:08.081 --> 00:37:09.332
A gunshot?

00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:11.459
-Good grief.
-Really?

00:37:12.794 --> 00:37:13.962
As you just saw,

00:37:15.713 --> 00:37:18.550
this isn't like the toys you're holding.

00:37:19.676 --> 00:37:21.594
This one can actually kill.

00:37:24.681 --> 00:37:25.682
So,

00:37:27.308 --> 00:37:28.852
what are you going to do to us?

00:37:29.352 --> 00:37:31.020
From now on,

00:37:31.104 --> 00:37:34.732
you're going to quietly follow
my orders and go to Pyongyang.

00:37:36.526 --> 00:37:37.527
That's right.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.655
They took the passengers
hostage to seize the plane.

00:37:40.738 --> 00:37:45.159
Now, I'll take them hostage
to get out of here.

00:37:45.243 --> 00:37:48.913
From here on,
tell them exactly what I'm about to say.

00:37:52.166 --> 00:37:53.960
We want…

00:37:54.836 --> 00:37:58.506
We want nothing more than that.

00:38:00.008 --> 00:38:03.303
"We want nothing more than that."

00:38:05.471 --> 00:38:06.973
If you don't meet our demands…

00:38:07.056 --> 00:38:09.309
"If you don't meet our demands…"

00:38:09.392 --> 00:38:10.435
…the second it hits noon…

00:38:10.518 --> 00:38:11.769
"…the second it hits noon…"

00:38:11.853 --> 00:38:14.480
…we'll detonate the bomb
on this plane and blow ourselves up.

00:38:14.564 --> 00:38:17.275
"…we'll detonate the bomb
on this plane and blow ourselves up."

00:38:17.358 --> 00:38:19.694
But if you do what we ask…

00:38:19.777 --> 00:38:21.821
"But if you do what we ask…"

00:38:22.322 --> 00:38:24.574
…we will safely release…

00:38:24.657 --> 00:38:26.075
"…we will safely release…"

00:38:26.159 --> 00:38:27.160
…all the passengers.

00:38:27.243 --> 00:38:28.328
"…all the passengers."

00:38:34.792 --> 00:38:35.793
Thank goodness.

00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:39.505
How can we trust them to keep their word?

00:38:40.298 --> 00:38:45.178
To show good faith, they said
they'd release half the passengers now.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.014
Fifty-eight in total.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.519
They're actually releasing the passengers?

00:38:54.228 --> 00:38:55.563
Hostage exchange.

00:38:55.647 --> 00:38:57.815
The condition I had Yamada deliver

00:38:57.899 --> 00:39:01.277
was that a senior Japanese government
official would take the place

00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:03.613
of the passengers
and become the hijackers' hostage.

00:39:04.322 --> 00:39:06.991
I was a Japanese businessman
who boarded the plane with drugs.

00:39:07.075 --> 00:39:09.494
To get out of the mess
without ending up in North Korea,

00:39:09.577 --> 00:39:11.579
I had to find a way to settle it.

00:39:13.122 --> 00:39:16.501
With a new hostage, the Revolutionary Army
secured their own safety,

00:39:17.126 --> 00:39:20.380
while South Korea's justification
for grounding the plane,

00:39:20.463 --> 00:39:23.341
citing passenger safety,
was no longer valid.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.011
North Korea granted
the Revolutionary Army asylum,

00:39:27.095 --> 00:39:28.805
and just as I expected,

00:39:28.888 --> 00:39:31.140
the plane was sent back to Japan
a few days later.

00:39:31.724 --> 00:39:35.395
They couldn't ignore the glare
of the international community.

00:39:36.145 --> 00:39:39.357
Once repatriated, Vice-Minister Natsume
and Captain Honda were celebrated

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.528
as national heroes in Japan parlaying
that fame into politics and success.

00:39:45.405 --> 00:39:48.116
But Chae Jiseok, the controller
who diverted the plane

00:39:48.199 --> 00:39:50.910
and saved the passengers,
was never hailed as a hero.

00:39:50.994 --> 00:39:54.163
Instead, he was pressured into silence
about what happened that day,

00:39:54.247 --> 00:39:56.290
until he finally hung up
his uniform for good.

00:39:56.374 --> 00:39:57.375
That's right.

00:39:58.334 --> 00:40:02.588
That's how the President and the KCIA
keep this country running.

00:40:05.008 --> 00:40:07.552
- Here he comes!
- Hey, he's here!

00:40:08.761 --> 00:40:09.762
GIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

00:40:09.846 --> 00:40:12.098
We share the joy
of the safe rescue

00:40:12.181 --> 00:40:14.726
of the abducted passengers in Seoul

00:40:14.809 --> 00:40:18.563
with the free people of the world.

00:40:19.522 --> 00:40:21.024
On this occasion,

00:40:21.107 --> 00:40:25.987
our government and our people have
once again renewed our vigilance

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.614
against the atrocities
of the communist forces.

00:40:30.241 --> 00:40:34.120
After the incident,
Japan started airport security checks

00:40:34.203 --> 00:40:36.372
and even enacted an anti-hijacking law

00:40:38.082 --> 00:40:41.335
which meant the good old days
of casually boarding a plane

00:40:41.419 --> 00:40:43.880
with a briefcase full of drugs were over.

00:40:48.468 --> 00:40:52.513
Too bad about that briefcase,
but leaving it was the right call.

00:41:01.898 --> 00:41:03.024
It's a gift.

00:41:04.734 --> 00:41:06.819
I doubt we'll ever see
each other again, but…

00:41:10.948 --> 00:41:12.075
For your silence.

00:41:19.916 --> 00:41:23.169
ITAZUKE AIRPORT, FUKUOKA, JAPAN

00:41:25.046 --> 00:41:28.591
And so,
I arrived in Fukuoka later than planned.

00:41:29.383 --> 00:41:32.428
There'd been a bit of trouble,
but business is business.

00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:38.643
Finally, I was about
to meet my business partner, Ikeda Yuji.

00:41:39.727 --> 00:41:40.728
Is it a woman?

00:41:41.521 --> 00:41:42.522
It's a woman.

00:41:44.607 --> 00:41:47.777
I was told I had to go through her
to reach Chairman Ikeda,

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.072
and the moment I fell out of her favor,
the deal was over.

00:42:07.213 --> 00:42:08.381
I'm Ikeda Yuji.

00:42:09.423 --> 00:42:10.675
I'm Matsuda Kenji.

00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:14.554
You're very late.

00:42:15.346 --> 00:42:17.431
Something came up.

00:42:19.892 --> 00:42:20.893
The goods?

00:42:26.274 --> 00:42:28.192
Can I borrow a light?

00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:42.415
I left the goods on the plane.

00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:46.335
I had to because of
the Revolutionary Army.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.091
Are you talking about the plane
that went to Pyongyang?

00:42:53.176 --> 00:42:55.553
That's the one. I was on it.

00:42:56.262 --> 00:42:57.763
I'm sorry.

00:42:58.764 --> 00:43:01.350
But I suppose
this is where our business ends.

00:43:02.351 --> 00:43:03.352
Farewell.

00:43:04.061 --> 00:43:05.104
It's a shame.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.025
I was hoping to show Chairman Ikeda
the best there is.

00:43:17.783 --> 00:43:18.868
I'll see you again.

00:43:53.194 --> 00:43:55.863
Damn it.
This hill's killing me.

00:43:55.947 --> 00:43:57.365
BUSAN DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE, KOREA

00:43:57.448 --> 00:43:59.951
It's killing me.

00:44:00.618 --> 00:44:02.370
After nerve-racking negotiations,

00:44:02.453 --> 00:44:05.122
Japan's Vice-Minister of Transport,
Natsume, boarded the plane

00:44:05.206 --> 00:44:06.874
-as a hostage himself…
-Wow.

00:44:06.958 --> 00:44:09.293
I thought they were
just a bunch of clueless idiots.

00:44:09.377 --> 00:44:10.920
But it looks like at least one of them

00:44:11.003 --> 00:44:13.381
- knew how to use his head.
- Yeah, pretty clever.

00:44:14.882 --> 00:44:16.050
Back to work, people.

00:44:16.133 --> 00:44:17.385
-Yes, Mr. Jang.
-Yes, sir.

00:44:17.468 --> 00:44:18.552
-Yes, sir.
-Come on.

00:44:24.225 --> 00:44:25.226
Oh, boy.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.939
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

00:44:30.523 --> 00:44:34.110
The Manjae Gang's movements
lately. Doesn't it bother you?

00:44:34.652 --> 00:44:35.653
Yeah.

00:44:36.862 --> 00:44:39.448
I mean, are these punks
trying to turn themselves

00:44:39.532 --> 00:44:41.909
-into export heroes by dealing meth?
-Right.

00:44:41.993 --> 00:44:44.245
Why do they keep getting involved
with the yakuza?

00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:46.580
- I know, right?
- Who is this?

00:44:48.666 --> 00:44:52.003
Uh… We still haven't been able
to identify him, sir.

00:45:02.138 --> 00:45:05.016
MEETING BETWEEN JO MANJAE
AND AN UNIDENTIFIED MALE IN A SUIT…

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.114
Baek!

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:05.618
Come here.

00:46:09.038 --> 00:46:11.665
Did you enjoy your vacation?
It must've been nice.

00:46:11.749 --> 00:46:14.085
You call a business trip a vacation?

00:46:16.962 --> 00:46:19.215
Where are you going? The boss is in there.

00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:31.060
Start talking! I said start talking! Hey!

00:46:34.271 --> 00:46:35.648
Move it, asshole! Hey!

00:46:39.693 --> 00:46:43.322
Talk, you bastard. Talk! I said, talk!

00:46:48.786 --> 00:46:52.540
Hey, come here, you bastard!
Spit it out! Spit it out now!

00:46:55.251 --> 00:46:56.419
You wanted to see me, sir?

00:46:56.502 --> 00:46:58.838
Hey, you're here.

00:46:58.921 --> 00:47:00.089
Good work out there.

00:47:02.842 --> 00:47:04.218
Let's go talk in my office.

00:47:05.553 --> 00:47:09.682
Hey! Start talking, you bastard!

00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:13.227
Get the hell up now!

00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:40.379
DIRECTOR GENERAL HWANG GUKPYEONG

00:47:43.674 --> 00:47:44.842
What've you got there?

00:47:46.051 --> 00:47:49.638
Uh, I got you some whiskey and cigars.

00:47:51.557 --> 00:47:52.850
Come on.

00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:54.977
You didn't have to.

00:48:05.905 --> 00:48:08.657
Damn it. It got on me.

00:48:11.785 --> 00:48:13.162
Hey, I liked it.

00:48:13.746 --> 00:48:16.582
The double hijacking. Good idea.

00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:19.001
Thank you, sir.

00:48:19.084 --> 00:48:23.130
The higher-ups can't stop raving about it.

00:48:23.214 --> 00:48:24.798
351 DOUBLE HIJACKING GIMPO
BAEK KITAE

00:48:24.882 --> 00:48:27.176
DHJ, double hijacking.

00:48:27.259 --> 00:48:29.553
JAY351 REQUESTING
DOUBLE HIJACKING AT GIMPO AIRPORT

00:48:29.637 --> 00:48:31.388
My code number, B73.

00:48:36.143 --> 00:48:39.563
I had given the boy's mother
the KCIA emergency number.

00:48:40.064 --> 00:48:42.441
"3, 8, 1, 1, 7, 7…"

00:48:42.525 --> 00:48:46.487
And thankfully,
she stayed calm and made the call.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:48.822
6, 7, 1, B, 7, 3…

00:48:48.906 --> 00:48:53.327
The KCIA
moved quickly, and just as I had planned…

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:56.914
the plane bound for Pyongyang
landed at Gimpo Airport.

00:48:56.997 --> 00:48:58.916
Anyway…

00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:00.834
…about Jo Manjae.

00:49:01.835 --> 00:49:04.338
I hear he's been dealing meth
with the yakuza.

00:49:05.673 --> 00:49:07.007
Yes, I'm aware.

00:49:10.094 --> 00:49:11.303
You're aware?

00:49:12.846 --> 00:49:13.847
Yes, sir.

00:49:21.438 --> 00:49:23.691
So why didn't you report it to me?

00:49:24.358 --> 00:49:25.526
Mr. Baek?

00:49:27.278 --> 00:49:28.362
Baek Kitae.

00:49:35.869 --> 00:49:36.870
That's right.

00:49:37.413 --> 00:49:38.872
My name is Baek Kitae.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.459
Head of the Intelligence Department,
KCIA Busan Branch.

00:52:18.323 --> 00:52:20.325
