Shoot!

It's because you're guilty.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.900
It's because you're afraid.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.940
the government has had to compromise

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.340
and resorted to many questionable tactics.

Huang Gongjie knew too much,

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.220
so this was the only solution.

but lets nothing through.

Mr. Lin, Lyu.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.480
I heard you're going back to Hong Kong.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.520
When are you leaving?

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.380
In the next couple of days.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.640
We've already bought the ferry tickets.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.790
I heard you're not planning to
return to Hong Kong.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.100
I've just taken over several hotels

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.150
and the water plant,

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.080
so I'll be pretty occupied.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.830
Besides,

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.020
staying in Macau isn't so bad, is it?

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.740
I was just about to
talk to you about this.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.440
Xian, you're a smart man.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:02.420
When it comes to business acumen,

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.290
among all of us who fled from Hong Kong

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.720
to Macau,

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.790
few can match you.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.610
I'm sure you understand.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:08.320
Macau's

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.920
recent trade boom

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.790
and market prosperity

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.270
are just wartime phenomena.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.660
Now that the war is over,

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.870
Hong Kong will remain as
the center of trade and finance.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.700
With the reputation and power

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.730
you've built for yourself in Macau
these past few years,

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:21.980
if you return to Hong Kong,

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.050
you'll certainly achieve great success

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:25.690
with boundless prospects ahead.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:26.470
Xian.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.480
Just look at what's happening in
the market these few days.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.180
So many business owners are packing up,

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.000
preparing to leave.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
So many companies,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.380
shops and hotels have already closed down.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.210
The streets are filled with workers
and laborers looking for jobs.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.930
If you hadn't taken over the water plant,

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.400
it would have shut down already.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.390
If you ask me,

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.830
you should come back with me.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.200
Mr. Lin, Lyu,

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.520
thank you for your kind intentions.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.570
After the prosperity,

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.070
Macau inevitably has to go through
some growing pains.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.980
That's why Macau

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.350
needs people to keep supporting it.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.360
I still remember when I first arrived
in Macau,

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.200
I was just a refugee who had nothing

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.630
and was living day to day.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.830
It was the years I spent in Macau

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.900
that gave me my chance,

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.300
and made me who I am today.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.670
Now that Macau is facing difficulties,

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.310
if I were to simply abandon it,

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.240
wouldn't that be unconscionable?

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.550
Therefore,

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.880
I've decided.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.530
I want to stay in Macau.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.330
First, I'll take over all the hotels

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.400
and public services

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.000
that previously employed
large numbers of workers

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.040
but have now shut down,

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.730
resulting in mass unemployment.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.640
At least we shouldn't let too many people

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.480
go hungry.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.030
And I believe

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.790
as long as we firmly root ourselves
in Macau,

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.120
sharing its breath

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:35.870
and destiny,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.710
Macau's future

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.710
will surely achieve new glory.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:41.410
Xian,

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.540
you're still the same Xian,

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.280
always thinking first about those
less fortunate than you,

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.610
and those who need help.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.070
Alright,

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.140
enough of this.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.290

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.820

will all be sold here.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:02.200

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.820
will be greater than before.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.550

in Hong Kong

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.680
and have settled in,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.930
you'll need to provide us
with more assistance

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.360
The way you put it sounds like

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.860
even if I don't do business
with anyone else,

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.830
I still have to do business
with you, Xian.

just one word from you

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.580
and we'll spare no effort.

What are your plans?

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:56.440
Thanks to your help,

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.050
over these years,

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.150
I started with the kerosene business

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:01.670
and expanded into various trades,

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.500
so things have gotten much busier.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.030
Though it's been hard work,

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.480
the profits

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.720
have been quite good.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.150
Macau

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.860
has opened up all business sectors.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.760
I want to see

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.040
if I can expand into other business areas

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.030
so as to make life better
for the people of Macau.

Putting knowledge to use

That's a good idea.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.470
I don't know if I can pull it off though.

the road ahead for Macau is
not going to be smooth.

I just received orders from
the new Governor, Oliveria.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.500
The Chinese community is prohibited

On what grounds?

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:58.900
What right does the government have

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.210
to ban our celebrations?

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.420
They're overstepping their bounds.

[Governor of Macau,
Albano Rodrigues de Oliveira]

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.780
The Macau government

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.980
has issued a ban

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:17.240
prohibiting any celebrations related
to the founding of

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.790
the People's Republic of China
from being held in Macao.

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:22.520
Did you not know?

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:24.790
Of course.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.740
But I want to ask...

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.570
why?

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.710
Macau

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.440
is a Portuguese territory.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.840
Portugal

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:40.880
has not established diplomatic relations
with the Communist government.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.440
Macau should not take sides prematurely

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.010
to avoid violating

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.280
our government's foreign policy.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:54.000
All Chinese in Macau are under
the jurisdiction of the Macau government.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.620
Government orders

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:02.220
must be obeyed by all residents,

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.310
including the Chinese.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.400
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.000
I'm sure you understand that

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.230
all Chinese in Macau
have only one motherland.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:15.150
There is no distinction between
the two governments.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.420
The Chinese in Macau

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.650
have always been connected by blood
to their motherland.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.570
Celebrating our country's rebirth

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.570
is the wish and right of
every Chinese person in Macau.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.460
It has nothing to do with
when or how Portugal

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.840
and the Portuguese Macau government

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.010
chooses

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.420
to take sides.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:32.350
Therefore,

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:33.980
I've come here

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.130
not intending to seek for permission.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.120
On behalf of the Chinese in Macau,

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.050
I am officially informing you that

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:41.300
this time,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.600
the celebrations for
the establishment of New China

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.130
will proceed as scheduled.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:47.840
That's all I have to say.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.410
What's wrong with all of you?

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.720
A Chinese man

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.470
dares to defy the Governor to his face,

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.410
showing contempt for the government,

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.010
and you all remain silent?

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.940
Are you all deaf or mute?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.010
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.930
perhaps you're not familiar with
the situation in Macau.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.190
I can only tell you that

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.110
Macau

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.010
is different not only from
other Portuguese colonies,

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.650
but also from any colony

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.280
of Western countries
anywhere in the world.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.160
Because here,

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.310
it's no longer a place where

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.000
the colonial government
have absolute control.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.960
96% of Macau's population is Chinese.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.790
And over these years...

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.030
for any government order

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.670
or administrative decision,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.030
it would have been
virtually impossible to implement

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:57.090
if not for

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.130
the support of the Chinese community.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.480
Is that so?

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.820
