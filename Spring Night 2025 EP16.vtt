Please review it, Your Majesty.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.400
The lists for recent imperial exams

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.840
have been finalized

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.160

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.360

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.960
it seems before the exams even began,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.400
you already

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.120
predetermined the selections.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.400
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.000
This is only a special imperial exam.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.120
I implore Your Majesty

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.000
to finalize the list promptly

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.720
for public announcement.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.640
In that case,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.000
you decide.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.800
I am weary.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.440
Your Majesty.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.800
The Crown Prince has passed.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.480
The nation lacks an heir.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.640
It may be better

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.920
to designate
the Crown Princess' unborn child

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.320
as the successor.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.160
I am still alive and well.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.360
In this matter,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.760
you are

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.400
somewhat overhasty.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.600
The court is restless.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.320
People are anxious.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.120
Without promptly appointing an heir,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.400
it's hard to quell dissent.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.320
But whether the child is male or female

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.840
remains unknown.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.800
You can't expect me to appoint

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.880
a princess as heir, can you?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.240
I guarantee

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.160
the Crown Princess' unborn child

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.200
will surely be a prince.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.320
This is also
the court's collective hope.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.200
Then let it be as you propose.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.920
Good buddy.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.960
Sorry for tonight.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.680
What?

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.280
Understood.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.960
Then I will

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.120
take my leave.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.640
Where are you going, Mr. Su?

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.240
Your sister and brother-in-law

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.840
need to share their longing.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.640
As an outsider,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.000
I should make space.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.600
That won't do.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.520
Nian.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.720
I've already

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.960
prepared your room.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.600
You sleep over there.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.680
Wait.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.560
Mai Tian and I are married.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.600
Brother-in-law.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.840
You acknowledge me
as your brother-in-law?

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.320
I won't accept it.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.000
Shen.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.280
Even if you deny it,

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.120
those two...

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.200
None of your concern.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.840
Eat mine.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.480
Wear mine.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.440
Use mine.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.360
Then you follow my rules.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.000
Zhifeng.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.240
Don't be so harsh.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.960
Ye Wuming isn't like that...

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.880
Zhifeng.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.760
Zhifeng.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.880
Then,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.040
do I still need to move out?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.200
There's no such thing

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.360
as a free lunch.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.720
When you go to see your wife,

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.320
remember to close the door.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.800
Don't be afraid.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.600
It's me.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.760
It's so late.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.200
What are you doing out here?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.600
To see me?

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.760
Yes.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.960
To see you.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.000
And you?

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.840
Aren't you here for me?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.800
Of course not.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.600
I came to watch the moon.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.000
Tonight's moonlight is beautiful.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.760
So beautiful.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.560
You're shameless!

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.840
Keep your voice down.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.760
Why does it feel like

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.000
we're having an affair?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.840
An affair?

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.520
What nonsense!

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.880
We were wed

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.200
in a proper ceremony.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.960
You're my...

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.120
You keep your voice down too.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.600
