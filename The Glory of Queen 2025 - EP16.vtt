[The Glory of Queen]

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.500
[Episode 16]

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.820
Step aside!

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.500
Someone.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.980
What's going on?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.380
Who's been here?

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.260
No one.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.780
Ever since Madam Pei was locked up here,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.820
nobody has ever come.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.580
Go and inform Eldest Master.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.060
Yes.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.380
My Lady,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.430
I've noticed
that you've been in low spirits

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.020
these past few days,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.380
and the atmosphere at home
reflects it as well.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.620
How about I take you out for a stroll?

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.780
No need.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.740
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.660
It's just that I really don't feel like
going out.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.620
It was my oversight.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.340
With Aunt's death,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.300
the most pitiable is Grandmother.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.900
She has to bear the pain
of losing her daughter.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.060
I wonder who could have done
such a cruel thing to Aunt.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.900
I must have missed something.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.620
If you can't figure it out for now,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.380
you could retrace everything
from the start.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.420
You might make some new discoveries.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.260
You've really reminded me.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.300
Madam has said

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.140
she will see no one.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.780
It's an urgent matter.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.260
Please pass on the message for me.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.180
Eldest Master also came yesterday,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.380
but Madam didn't see him.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.820
Lady Song, please go back.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.900
Lady Song, please wait.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.060
Madam,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.580
please take good care of yourself.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.220
Why have you come to see me?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.020
I want to take a look at the ledger

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.300
of the counterfeit workshop

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.980
that Lady Pei found before.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.740
But the ledgers are now
in Eldest Master's hands,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.580
so I'm afraid they won't allow
just anyone to check them.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.500
Come over.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.540
Zhiyao,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.980
from today onward,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.540
you are the acting head
of the Pei family.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.700
You may, in my name,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.260
review all the accounts
of the Pei Manor,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.060
including those of the shop.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.300
Are you willing
to take on this responsibility?

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.820
Yes.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.020
Thank you, Madam.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.780
Mother has appointed you
as chief steward,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.220
which surely shows her trust in you.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.100
[Ledger]

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.700
This is the ledger
of the counterfeit workshop.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.540
Thank you, Eldest Master.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.060
She cares so much
about Xiuning's life and death,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.350
and is also unusually attentive

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.900
to the affairs
of the counterfeit workshop.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.020
There's probably more to it
than meets the eye.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.780
About ten years ago,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.020
she was taken in by a beggar.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.140
At the time, she was around seven
or eight years old.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.940
However, she fell seriously ill,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.700
and when she woke up,
she had forgotten everything.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.540
Ten years ago...

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.260
When exactly was it ten years ago?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.340
They said it was a few days

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.460
after the fifteenth day
of the eighth month.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.380
But since it's been too long,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.780
they can't remember

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.140
the exact date.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.460
A few days after the fifteenth day
of the eighth month,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.220
which was very close to the day
the Song family had their misfortune.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.100
Her surname is also Song.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.020
Could it be…?

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.060
This ledger

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.860
records all the ingredients listed

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.940
on my aunt's incense recipe.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.820
[Ledger]
There are only purchases but no sales.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.420
These ingredients

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.580
just so happened to start being bought

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.700
only after my aunt disappeared,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.820
and continued to be purchased
up until the counterfeit workshop

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.900
ran into trouble.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.540
Still, none were sold.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.660
Over all these years,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.060
a considerable amount
must have accumulated.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.420
What on earth did she use it all for?

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.700
Master.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.860
What exactly is Father hiding?

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.780
I can see your every move.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.420
Not to mention
it was right under my nose.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.180
What are you hiding?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.860
Take it out.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.260
Hand it over!

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.140
Give it to me!

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.420
Give it to me!

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.340
What's this? Is this for me?

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.300
You made this new perfume pouch
for me, didn't you?

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.780
I remember this scent.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.070
It's the same fragrance

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.460
from when we pledged ourselves
to each other.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.300
I know I still have a place
in your heart.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.060
It's the scent of ambergris.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.260
What is the connection
between what Song Zhiyao

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.700
is investigating
and the woman imprisoned in the house?

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.900
Is this what you're looking for?

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.380
Where did you find this?

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.500
First, tell me

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.340
what you're investigating.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.980
Did you find it on a woman?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.060
Is that woman in her thirties?

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.860
Her... Her earlobe...

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.660
There's a small red mole on it,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.940
right?

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.860
Tell me,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.060
is she still alive?

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.340
She is alive.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.900
Zhiyao.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.540
Haven't you always wanted to know

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.420
the reason I came to the Pei family?

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.500
On the day

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.020
I was abducted,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.180
I found this perfume pouch,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.620
and that's when I remembered everything.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.860
Pei Jingheng,

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.340
I'm not an orphan.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.220
My family used to run a fragrance shop,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.340
and business was good.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.580
But later, we were persecuted,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.380
and my family was torn apart.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.340
My aunt, Song Ping,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.980
went missing for nearly ten years

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.420
and was kept locked in that dungeon.

00:08:29.995 --> 00:08:35.995
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.940
The madwoman you saw...

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.860
She is my aunt,
the one who loved me the most.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.740
Do you remember the incense
you made me smell

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.580
at the counterfeit workshop?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.900
That was my aunt's recipe.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.460
I had always thought

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.940
that all of this
was Pei Xiuning's doing.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.380
But now,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.340
tell me,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.820
who exactly kidnapped my aunt?

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.500
No matter who it is,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.340
the words I spoke before

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.420
always count.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.620
You can trust me.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.580
I will definitely help you.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.580
Cry if you need to.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.220
You must have been terrified

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.940
when you remembered everything
back then.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.020
It's my fault

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.180
for not being careful enough,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.460
for not realizing

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.540
that you had to bear so much all alone.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.300
Zhiyao,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.460
I will definitely help you
find your aunt.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.780
But that person

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.100
kidnapped my aunt for nearly ten years,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.500
and he was still able to get rid of
Pei Xiuning without leaving a trace.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.220
This web of schemes runs too deep.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.860
If you get involved,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.060
I'm afraid it could put you in danger.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.820
From now on, with me here,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.860
you won't have to worry
about anything anymore.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.500
