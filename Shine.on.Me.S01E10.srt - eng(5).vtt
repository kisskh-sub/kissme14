00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.060
So you're calling

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.320
to invite me

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.340
to your wedding?

You got it.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.160
I need everyone

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.640
to come a day earlier to help me out.

"Everyone"?

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.080
Yeah, both our dorms.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.500
I don't think I can make it on the 1st.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.979
You know how it is in Finance,

Uh-huh. Pure cruelty, isn't it?

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.480
Alright, then.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.320
I'll let you off the hook.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.100
But Xiguang,

are you still hung up on

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.419
what happened before graduation?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.960
I've been debating if I should

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.460
keep you two at separate tables.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.320
It's fine.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.500
It's all water under the bridge.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.520
Really?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.079
Then why did you insist

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:21.880
I keep it a secret from Rong and Siliang

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.840
when you sent those gifts

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.700
after coming back from Europe?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.360
You had me so worried

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.280
that I even kept my husband in the dark,

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.420
just so he wouldn't accidentally blab
to Zhuo Hui and others.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.220
Back when I got home from Europe,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.640
I tried messaging everyone,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.820
but couldn't reach any of you.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.540
Then it hit me
that you probably switched

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.740
to Shanghai numbers.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.120
And you know,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.200
after my QQ got hacked,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.260
I never bothered getting a new one.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.660
So I had to resort to email,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.980
and Xiaofeng was the only one
who wrote back.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.160
You can't really blame me for that.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.800
We all switched to work emails, okay?

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.800
But I guess
you do have a heart after all.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.380
At least you had the decency
to ask Xiaofeng

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.240
for my new number.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.680
Mainly because you've got a mean punch.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.820
Oh, you're just asking for it,
aren't you?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.780
So, since graduation,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.420
you haven't been in touch

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.500
with Siliang and the others at all?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.000
I kept thinking I'd reach out later.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.760
And then, next thing I knew,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.720
time had just slipped away.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.840
That's it once you start working.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.020
We only

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.120
kept in touch back when we first moved

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.240
to Shanghai.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.640

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.420
time after time.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.020
Gradually, we just stopped trying.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.820
Come to think of it,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.500
it's been three whole months
since we last saw each other.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.600
Oh, Xiguang,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.180
I forgot to ask.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.320
Why did Rong say
that you went abroad for your studies?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.500
I have no idea.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.940
Why would she say that?

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.720
Beats me.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.920
It was back when we first moved
to Shanghai.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.020
After that,
she never really brought it up again.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.880
But since I couldn't reach you
back then,

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.240
I totally fell for it.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.079

I've cursed you out in my head.

Hey, I'm totally innocent.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.020

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.320

30% off.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.020
Let's just go with that.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.400
This is An.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.660
She has the best taste in our store.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.800
I'll have her

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.940
help you pick some out.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.480
Sure.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.420
This way, please.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.440
Dr. Lin,

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.080
please, have a seat.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.340
I'll go get some water for you.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.020
Miss.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.360
Thanks.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.320
With such a lovely face
and a great figure,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.500
you can pull off anything.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.920
You should really try out
all kinds of styles.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.000
What kind of style do you prefer?

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.740
Something simple and comfortable.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.460
How about these?

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.080
They look nice.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.080
Or

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.420
you could also branch out
into other styles.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.320
This way, please.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.280
A sweet, girly look like this

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.380
would suit you perfectly.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.020
But we're heading to Shanghai.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.720
I'm afraid I'll hold us up
if I try on too many.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.080
We're in no rush.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.200
Try them all.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.100

pay already?

she seems to think the invitation
came from me.

Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

you should introduce her to him.

go in?

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.580
Mr. Lin,

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.380
did she

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.280
get the wrong idea?

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.680
Does she think...?

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.060
What?

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:11.400
Just like when we were
buying clothes earlier.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.060
Actually,

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.300
a little misunderstanding won't hurt.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.160
I've been single for years.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.220
It's kind of embarrassing

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.200
to always be seen alone.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.640
Besides, I'm quite a catch.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.060
You aren't

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.240
losing out either.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.300
No way.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.860
It's not like I'm getting a discount.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.620
Really? No?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.040
Alright then.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.180
Mr. Li.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.540
Yusen.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.140
Mr. Li,

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.220
how

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:10.780
have you been?

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.240
How's your blood sugar?

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.980
Have you been sneaking
any high-sugar fruits?

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.180
Look, I'm a doctor myself,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.120
and your teacher.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.000
I know my own body.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.660
So,

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.640
is this your girlfriend?

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.480
Hello.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.560
No.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.500
I know Mr. Lin has his principles.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.120
I'm still pursuing her.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.340
Good.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.360
Very good.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.380
It's good to have a goal.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.320
Wait,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.900
why am I nodding?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.080
He's just telling his teacher

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:05.960
that he's pursuing me.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.560
Do I really need to go along with this?

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.740
I was just worried

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.480
you'd stay the way you were before.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.140
You can't hold a scalpel anymore,

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.760
but there's more to life

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.620
than the operating table.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.020
No matter what,

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.900
you have to take care of yourself

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.380
and live your life well.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:26.800
I will.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.140
What's wrong?

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:37.920
It's been a long time

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.880
since I've visited him.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.960
He's an authority in neurosurgery

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.740
with students everywhere.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.220
But he carefully nurtured only

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.560
a few.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.820
I was one of them,

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:51.940
his last protégé.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:53.760
I...

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.760
let all his hard work go to waste.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.560
But it's not your fault.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.680
Your teacher doesn't blame you either.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.960
Besides, you're still amazing now.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.740
At least,

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.220
your future boss
thinks very highly of you.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.400
My future boss?

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.180
You?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.140
Yeah.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.300
Alright,

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.460
it's a deal.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.520
Just make sure

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.920
you don't fire me.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:25.820
It's a deal.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.180
Come on, it's a wedding.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.260
Can you cheer up a bit?

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:30.620
Considering the fact

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.260
that I just wasted

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.500
being "confessed to" in public

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.960
for the first time on you,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:35.800
the least you could do is brighten up.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:36.900
Is that so?

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.220
Are you really

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.260
that unpopular?

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.800
You sure snapped out of it fast.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.080
Sen,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.680
finally decided to show off

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.560
your girlfriend to the world?

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.780
I'm not...

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.660
This is Nie, from work.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.320
Lu Sha's scream

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.340
startled her so much that she fell

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:03.880
from the building.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.860
Lu Sha felt so guilty about it

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.100
that she specifically asked me

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:06.880
to bring her to the wedding.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.060
You know the rules, Yusen.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.740
Last one here has to

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.500
knock back three shots.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.500
I'll pass.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.720
I have to drive back

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.380
to Suzhou tonight.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.880
Oh, come on.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.740
Rules are rules.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.960
Who here didn't drive?

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.980
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.420
Worst case, just take a cab back.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.660
Let me fill your glass.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.460
I'll find someone to do it for me.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.460
Yusen,

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.640
you really are

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.160
on another level of shameless.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.840
The wedding is about to begin.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.640
Please take your seats, everyone.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.780
Let's welcome

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.180
the bride and groom
for their grand entrance.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.640
Come on, let's all have a drink.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.900
Cheers!

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.260
The food here is actually pretty good.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.460
Maybe I'll have my wedding here too.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.140
You?

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.960
By the time you actually find your girl,

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.780
the hotel

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.660
might have long since

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.540
changed its head chef.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.960
Hey, who are you doubting?

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.340
By next year...

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.380
You prepared a red envelope?

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.420
Yeah.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.860
Back home,

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.080
we hand out the red envelopes
during the toasts.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.300
Where's yours?

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.560
I had my wedding gift

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.760
delivered to her place ages ago.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.120
Thanks, guys,

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.360
for coming to the only wedding

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.440
I'll ever have.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.440
Come on.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:17.880
Eat up.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:18.780
Enjoy the meal.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:19.640
Congratulations.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.040
Congratulations.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.080
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.880
Congratulations.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.760
Congratulations.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.520
You're with Yusen.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.720
I really shouldn't be taking this.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.040
He doesn't speak for me.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.160
It doesn't feel right.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.060
Just take it.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.500
But that would be double-dipping.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:39.940
Then you can just

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.640
return the favor double.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.000
There's no need.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.340
Keep it.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.140
Alright then.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.460
In that case, I'll take it.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.420
Congratulations.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.320
Come on.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.320
Now that the gift is tucked away,

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.860
let's have another round.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:52.400
Cheers.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.160
Thank you.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.340
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.100
Congratulations.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:55.840
Thanks for coming.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.920
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.320
Thanks.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.400
Why on earth did you tell her

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.780
to pay me back double?

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.220
Even for a joke,

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.100
it was a bit too lame.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.320
I was taking inflation

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.480
into account.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.460
I can't

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.500
let my future boss
get the short end of the stick.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.480
Oh, thank you so much.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.780
So, what's the plan?

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.360
Shall we head back
when finished, or what?

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.600
Since we're all here,

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.060
how about some karaoke?

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.340
Let's join wedding chamber games first.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.420
There's enough of us

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.740
to back her up.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.940
We can't let Lu Sha get picked on.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.360
We don't have to go to karaoke, do we?

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.080
Don't like it?

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.200
Just look at my name,

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.080
and you'll know singing
isn't exactly my thing.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.080
Why are you staring?

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.800
It's not like my name
is tattooed on my forehead.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.780
Let me think.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.000
"Nie."

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.760
It indicates some super-powered hearing.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.220
There's a famous composer
named Nie Er.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.600
You must be a natural

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.400
with music.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.320
It just means all my talent

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.520
went straight to my ears.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600
I'm only good for listening.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.760
So, are you coming
to prank the newlyweds?

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.140
Of course not.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.160
Saving up some good karma.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.840
You'll pay for it at your own wedding.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.180
Fair point.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:23.920
So? What do you say?

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.000
Are you coming or what?

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.280
I thought you were dying to get married.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.720
You should come and see

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.920
how it's done.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.060
Just getting some practice in.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.440
She wants to save up some good karma.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.960
Otherwise, when she has the wedding...

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:42.880
Nie,

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.540
are you in that much of a hurry
to tie the knot?

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.440
You're already worrying
about being pranked

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.480
at your own wedding?

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.800
No, I'm not.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.920
He's just talking trash.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.920
Well...

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.680
if you're in no rush,

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.560
come join the pranks with us.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.500
On behalf of the groom's squad,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.820
we've decided
all the wedding pranks tonight

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.860
are for the groom only.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.960
Since this guy
is the very first among us

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.900
to tie the knot,

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.420
we are absolutely green with envy.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.540
If we don't mess with him now,

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.220
we'll never get over it.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.140
Am I right, everyone?

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.000
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.180
Well,

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.940
as the bride's side,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.780
we're totally

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.660
with you.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.380
We'll

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.700
only mess with the groom, too.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.620
- Groom-only!
- Groom-only!

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.420
- Groom-only!
- Groom-only!

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.660
All right.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.260
Let's keep it classy
with the pranks, everyone.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.820
The first round is easy.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.900
A quick Q&A.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.380
Our lucky man here needs to tell us:

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.260
When exactly did you
first meet the bride?

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.220
If you get it wrong,

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.060
you'll have to carry her
and spin around three times.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.080
Three isn't enough.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:39.820
Make it ten.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.820
Yeah, ten!

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.620
- Ten times!
- Ten times!

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.340
- Ten times!
- Ten times!

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.280
20 May 2010.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.060
Down to the second.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.560
- Ten times!
- Ten times!

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.120
- Ten times!
- Ten times!

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.620
- Ten times!
- Ten times!

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.940
- Two.
- Two.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.260
- Three.
- Three.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.660
- Four.
- Four.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.580
- Five.
- Five.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.040
Lu Sha really found herself
a real straight shooter.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.120
- Seven.
- Seven.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.300
- Eight.
- Eight.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.500
That was a trick question.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.100
Who could possibly remember it
down to the second?

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.020
Looks like we've got
another stickler over here.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.900
She took a hit to the head.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.020
That's why she's a bit rigid.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.980
As if any of you could remember.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:30.640
Of course.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.700
Try me.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.380
What?

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.400
When

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.220
did you first meet

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.020
your future wife?

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.180
Dude, you're still single.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.820
15 January 2011.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.000
Seven twenty-eight

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.540
and fifty-two seconds sharp.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.880
I get it now.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.020
You can just wing it.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.100
Nice try,

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:04.900
but still no luck.​​

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.380
I'm not letting you hang out
with Shengyi anymore.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.620
You picked up
those bad habits way too fast.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.840
Didn't you say
you wanted to keep your karma clean?

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.380
I was just checking it out.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.380
I never actually joined in
on the hazing.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.660
Besides, I've figured it out.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.660
I'm still young.
Marriage is a long way off.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.420
So there was no need
to worry about my karma so early.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.440
Not necessarily.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.860
It depends on the other's...

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.420
Actually, Shengyi mentioned

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.800
you're looking to get married
sooner than later.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.500
Don't worry, Mr. Lin.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.820
I won't use

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.120
the tricks I just learned

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.100
at your wedding.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.680
I'm thrilled to hear

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.760
that you'll be at my wedding.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.300
But I bet you won't

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.000
have the time for pranks.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.780
How is that possible?

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.380
If I'm at the wedding,

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.500
how could I not have time
to prank the couple?

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:57.700
Just you wait.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.380
I can't wait to see Mr. Lin

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.200
get roasted as a groom.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.460
I will.

Xigua!

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:01.640
Boss.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.820
Xiaofeng.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.280
What are you guys doing here?

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.540
Nie Xigua,

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.940
you'd better start explaining yourself.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:08.660
Didn't you say

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.740
you were gonna be stuck
in Suzhou working overtime

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.860
and couldn't get away on the 1st?

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.700
Boss, let go.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.080
Just let me explain my way out of this.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.380
You never said

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.700
you were coming to Shanghai today.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.940
You look amazing today.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.340
I didn't even recognize you
at first glance.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.880
Nie Xiguang,

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.320
you're working in Suzhou?

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.420
We all heard

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.460
you went abroad to study.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.620
Boss,

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.380
when did you get back
in touch with Xiguang?

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.300
You didn't say a word.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:30.960
Xiguang,

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:31.680
I really thought

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.920
you were studying abroad.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.660
I changed my number in July

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.080
and tried calling you,
but I couldn't get through.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.340
I am working in Suzhou.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.060
In July, I was overseas

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.160
and didn't have
international roaming turned on,

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.300
so I couldn't pick up.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.800
And another thing,

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.020
why does everyone keep saying

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.940
I went to "study abroad"?

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.740
It was just a study tour,
not a full degree abroad.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.800
It was basically just two months

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.940
of traveling.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.040
A study tour?

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:58.760
Yeah.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.600
I went with Jiang Rui.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:04.760
So you weren't studying abroad.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.100
No.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.500
Xiguang,

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.140
Boss was setting up
the wedding venue today,

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.240
why didn't you come?

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.160
I...

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.380
Honestly,

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.140
you really should have come.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.400
You can learn a lot from the experience.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.280
By the time you tie the knot,

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.720
you'll have a handle.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:30.880
Plus,

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:31.900
decorating a wedding venue

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:32.660
is actually a lot of fun.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.120
I've always been the lazy one.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.460
You guys know that.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.400
By the way, Xiguang,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.360
I want to apologize

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.100
for what happened before.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:51.780
Sorry

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.640
for misjudging you.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.620
It's only after being in the real world

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.300
that I realized how rare

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.460
our bond from college truly is.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.100
Now that...

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.840
I've found my happiness,

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.460
I hope you

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.600
find yours too.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.300
Seriously,

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.280
don't just sit on the sidelines.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.740
Go find your Mr. Right.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.160
Ye Rong!

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:15.900
Xiguang.

What's wrong?

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:07.680
I ran into

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.660
my old classmates from university.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:19.960
Your classmates?

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.160
Come with me.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.870
♪You are the sun in my life♪

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.040
Xigua.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.680
Aren't you going to introduce us?

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.240
So, you actually had

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.020
a nickname like that?

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.460
How come you never told me?

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.900
Hello, everyone. I'm Lin Yusen.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.860
Hi.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.660
We're Xigua's classmates from college.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:06.500
I figured.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.520
Xiguang has mentioned you before.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:10.980
Mr. Zhuang,

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.400
we meet again.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:19.780
Mr. Lin.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.340
Wait, you know each other?

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.360
I used to work at Shengyuan.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.380
We've met at a meeting.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.800
You told me you couldn't help out

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.020
because of overtime.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.820
Turns out you were just busy
with your boyfriend,

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.180
choosing love over friends, huh?

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.460
You should've just said so.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.760
I wouldn't have forced you anyway.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:43.760
Don't blame her.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.740
Xiguang was supposed to work late,

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.580
but an old friend of mine
is getting married today,

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.680
and she insisted on meeting Xiguang.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.380
That's why I dragged her out here.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.240
Alright.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.240
It's not like I'm actually mad at her.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.940
You went to get the car, right?

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.060
Where is it?

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.440
It's blocked in.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.320
The police can't find
the other car's owner yet.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:08.940
Afraid you'd get restless waiting,

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.580
so I came over first.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.600
So we're stuck...?

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.540
Just a little longer.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.160
It shouldn't delay our trip

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:18.900
back to Suzhou.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.900
You're heading back to Suzhou tonight?

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.320
But you have to come back tomorrow.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.100
Wouldn't that be exhausting?

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.540
What's exhausting about it?

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.380
Anyway,

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.700
her boyfriend is doing all the driving.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:30.640
Xiguang,

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.740
you're incredible.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:32.980
Only six months since graduation,

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.660
and you've already landed
such a handsome boyfriend.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:35.740
Exactly.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.080
And you kept it from me.

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.140
Alright, spill it.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.340
How did you two meet?

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.280
Who made the first move?

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.220
Zhuang Xu,

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.240
where are you going?

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.580
I'm going to hail a cab.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.840
Why go somewhere else?

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.380
Can't you get one here?

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.440
You can get one here if you want.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.560
Stop right there.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.960
Wait, why did they leave?

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.120
Didn't they say this was the best spot

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120
to catch a cab?

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.860
Maybe it's easier to find one
if we spread out.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.700
Oh, there's one.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.120
Xiang Qun, go flag it down.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:13.740
Well, Xigua,

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:14.740
we're heading out too.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:16.800
You're coming with Xigua

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.160
for our wedding, okay?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.760
Definitely.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:21.940
See you tomorrow.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:25.740
See you tomorrow.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:26.920
Bye.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:27.640
Bye.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.700
Is the car still blocked in?

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.500
I want to get back to Suzhou
a bit early.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:50.780
Forget that.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.460
I'm taking you out.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.740
I can't just

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.100
bring you out here all happy,

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.480
only to take you back
looking so miserable.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.320
Do I really look like that?

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.820
Your tears are practically welling up.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:16.220
So,

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.280
do you want to see the night view,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.620
or catch a movie?

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:20.660
Or,

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.480
if you're into games,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.220
we could hit up

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.160
one of those arcades.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.040
You know...

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.300
the ones

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.680
where you can dance,

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.020
shoot hoops,

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.980
and race cars.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.480
Then let's check out the night view,

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.300
catch a movie,

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.300
and then hit the arcade.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.340
Nie Xiguang,

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.920
you really want it all, don't you?

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.580
Quick, help me check

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.160
if I have enough cash on me.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.780
There's a bank over there.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.020
I'll go get some.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.280
Is it really not enough?

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.040
Actually, there's plenty left.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:09.920
I'll go get more.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.280
Tell me, Miss Nie,

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.420
just how much of my money

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.760
are you planning to blow tonight?

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.900
