WEBVTT

00:46.671 --> 00:47.672
Damn it.

00:51.718 --> 00:52.802
Mr. Attorney.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.221
Can you hear me, Mr. Attorney?

00:56.848 --> 00:57.682
Mr. Attorney!

00:58.558 --> 00:59.684
Yes, what is it?

00:59.768 --> 01:01.269
They're seriously shooting at me.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.773
They want me dead, or what?

01:05.565 --> 01:08.943
Well, they're trying to restrict
your liquidity, Sang-ung.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.947
But I've always been short on it.

01:13.865 --> 01:14.866
All right.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.659
Just hang in there a little longer.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.841
Lure those thugs in
and get to the branch manager's office.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.051
MANAGER'S OFFICE

02:57.760 --> 02:58.595
That way leads…

02:58.678 --> 02:59.637
SECRET VAULT

02:59.721 --> 03:01.055
…straight to the secret vault.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.558
Once it's all set, I'll lower you down.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.618
Damn it!

03:24.621 --> 03:26.497
Hey, Bun-mi. Hurry up!

03:29.459 --> 03:31.211
Just try to hold on a little longer.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.186
GIMHAE SAVINGS BANK

03:58.112 --> 04:00.490
Catch Kang Sang-ung first.
We can't lose him.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.033
Yes, ma'am!

04:38.987 --> 04:40.405
Jeez. I might throw up.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.781
-I'm so full.
-Hey.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.952
What took you so long?

04:46.035 --> 04:47.870
What? I should've come later.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.205
Find Kang Sang-ung first.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.248
They're here.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.426
Make the Mundane Vanguard
and Jo Anna's crew fight.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.470
Then no one will be able to stop
or come after us.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.723
We will be the only ones

05:07.473 --> 05:08.516
to enter the vault.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.187
We're heading to the manager's office now.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.735
Don't come.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.031
Mr. Attorney? Mr. Attorney!

05:23.114 --> 05:24.073
Did we get cut off?

05:24.824 --> 05:25.992
Hurry, let's go.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.508
We gotta hurry down.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.883
Mr. Attorney?

06:23.966 --> 06:25.385
Mr. Attorney!

06:28.137 --> 06:29.138
Mr. Attorney.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.393
Mr. Attorney, are you okay?

07:21.190 --> 07:23.526
You always go beyond my expectations.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.323
Honestly, your superpower's the best
as long as you have money.

07:32.785 --> 07:33.619
The problem is,

07:34.537 --> 07:35.955
you're low on cash now, right?

07:48.509 --> 07:50.428
I have enough to shut you up.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.478
A fun new product is coming out soon.

08:01.939 --> 08:02.773
Hey.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.860
What do you even get out of all this?

08:05.943 --> 08:07.487
Money, of course.

08:07.570 --> 08:11.657
I need a lot of money
to use your superpower properly.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.592
REPLENISH YOUR CALORIES!

08:33.095 --> 08:33.971
Is that all?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.308
Totally disappointing.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.147
We might be out of our depth today.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.325
No.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.827
Min-suk has something fun to tell me.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.704
Gotta finish up and go.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.696
Go this way!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.085
You want a drink too?

09:55.052 --> 09:55.970
Mr. Attorney!

09:56.470 --> 09:57.930
Mr. Attorney! Bun-mi!

09:58.014 --> 09:59.223
Hey, can you hear me?

09:59.807 --> 10:00.808
Mr. Attorney!

10:10.109 --> 10:11.485
A terrible stench.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.532
I couldn't see it,

10:17.158 --> 10:18.409
but I could tell.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.121
It's something strangely familiar

10:23.372 --> 10:26.417
yet ever-distant and nostalgic.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.129
This awful smell is…

10:35.843 --> 10:36.677
money.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.438
What's so funny? We're about to die.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.028
GIMHAE BANK
UNDERGROUND VAULT

10:55.404 --> 10:57.782
What's behind that wall?

10:58.324 --> 10:59.408
The sewer line?

11:02.244 --> 11:05.331
It may stink just as bad,
but it's something else.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.375
Then what?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.171
According to the floor plan,

11:12.254 --> 11:15.591
this room measures 17 meters wide
and 11 meters long.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.680
But it can't possibly be that large.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.733
This is reassuring.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.944
Confidence really does come from money.

12:28.164 --> 12:28.998
Hi there.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.128
Sang-ung.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.464
Mister.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.595
I told you not to call me that.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.143
So that's where the money was.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.113
Your dad's piggy bank
is on a whole other level.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.579
Bun-mi, take him with you
and wait outside.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.331
I'm here to see this bastard today.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.876
I gotta say goodbye before I go.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.879
We'll head out first, then.
Bun-mi, let's go.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.504
I always knew money was good,

13:59.213 --> 14:01.215
but I didn't realize it was this good.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.609
You're in good shape.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.739
Money is good.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.409
You don't see anything in your way, huh?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.679
No. I can see everything.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.249
Just take one hit.

16:33.993 --> 16:34.827
What?

16:43.210 --> 16:45.170
I have no idea what's going on.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.424
Feels like I blacked out

16:49.258 --> 16:51.010
after drinking last night.

17:07.234 --> 17:10.029
My superpowers aren't working.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.202
What the hell?

17:17.286 --> 17:20.080
We're not going to arrest you.
Don't worry.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.458
Jeez.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.268
-What is he doing?
-Does that seem right?

17:46.106 --> 17:46.940
Get out.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.943
No superpowers,
and no more of your nonsense.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.111
Excuse me?

17:51.195 --> 17:52.279
Just get out.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.156
Hang on! Just wait.

17:56.784 --> 17:57.618
Jo Nathan.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.287
He's selling power-copying drugs.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.915
-We'll check it.
-No checking.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.500
We gotta go get that bastard.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.298
I told you.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.759
More people are ending up in danger
because of you.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.347
How is this on me?

18:18.972 --> 18:20.682
You expect me to just sit

18:20.766 --> 18:23.227
and watch the world fall apart?

18:23.310 --> 18:25.479
You think the world's only in danger now?

18:26.814 --> 18:29.775
You may not know, but it was never safe.
Not for a second.

18:29.858 --> 18:33.362
There have always been threats
like the Mundane Vanguard and their drugs.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.907
This fight started
even before we were born,

18:36.990 --> 18:39.326
and it won't end even after we're dead.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.956
Not all fights are head-on.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.333
You're not the only one in this fight.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.626
Get out.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.585
Come on!

18:51.880 --> 18:53.841
I'm hungry. Let's hurry up and go.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.655
GIMHAE SAVINGS BANK

19:28.208 --> 19:29.835
Take them back to the lab.

19:29.918 --> 19:30.752
Yes, ma'am.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.468
-Where's Lee Su-eun?
-We haven't found her yet.

19:39.052 --> 19:39.970
Go get her now.

19:51.106 --> 19:51.940
Whoa.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.713
What are you doing?

20:18.717 --> 20:20.302
Drop them.

20:24.848 --> 20:25.682
Man.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.101
So hot. Let's take these off.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.957
Thanks to my son-in-law,
I finally got to see this place.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.210
And who the hell are you?

20:56.004 --> 20:57.547
Are you Jo Won-do's daughter?

20:58.048 --> 20:59.633
You're just like your father.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.386
No, I'm not.

21:04.137 --> 21:07.140
Don't do anything stupid.
Just stay right there.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.270
I have no business with you.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.887
You fought like crazy
on someone else's money, passed out,

21:46.471 --> 21:47.931
and ever since you came to,

21:49.683 --> 21:51.143
your superpowers haven't worked?

21:52.102 --> 21:52.936
Yes.

21:56.857 --> 21:57.941
You are maxed out.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.527
He's talking nonsense again.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.529
What am I, a credit card?

22:02.612 --> 22:06.158
-What?
-Your superpowers are beyond your control.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.163
Stay with me, okay?

22:18.879 --> 22:22.257
That's why I told you from the start
not to touch other people's money.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.970
I just thought you meant a general rule

22:27.054 --> 22:29.681
about not touching other people's money.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.062
Well, then…

22:36.438 --> 22:37.481
When will they come back?

22:37.981 --> 22:39.191
Who knows?

22:40.901 --> 22:43.278
Like everything in life,

22:43.362 --> 22:45.197
you shouldn't get too greedy.

22:45.947 --> 22:48.116
Whether it's with money, food, or alcohol.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.745
The moment you go beyond your limits,
trouble starts.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.333
So you mean

22:57.334 --> 22:59.586
I never stood a chance from the start.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.132
If I fought with my own money
while they were fucking strong,

23:04.216 --> 23:05.884
this was never a fair game!

23:06.385 --> 23:10.013
If that was the plan, you could've made
more money before giving me the powers!

23:10.514 --> 23:11.348
Sang-ung.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.893
-This isn't a fight about money.
-It is about money.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.020
You know that too. Don't be ridiculous!

23:17.104 --> 23:18.522
What if you had no superpowers?

23:20.774 --> 23:21.983
You wouldn't fight them?

23:24.277 --> 23:25.779
Now that you have no superpowers,

23:26.279 --> 23:28.323
you're just gonna sit and watch them?

23:32.369 --> 23:35.038
Hardly anyone would spend
30 million won from their mom

23:35.705 --> 23:39.126
to save complete strangers.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.713
It wasn't the superpower
that saved those people.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.841
It was you.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.409
Have a good think about it.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.829
Our strength

24:17.330 --> 24:18.748
doesn't come from money.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.294
While fighting…

24:31.636 --> 24:32.929
while protecting something…

24:36.308 --> 24:38.226
there comes a moment when you realize

24:42.981 --> 24:44.900
that money doesn't really matter.

24:51.656 --> 24:55.494
You need to realize that
before you can use your superpower again.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.090
THE MUNDANE VANGUARD

25:53.802 --> 25:54.636
Damn it.

26:06.856 --> 26:10.777
You don't have what it takes
to contain his superpower.

26:31.506 --> 26:35.927
Living like a moron
is probably worse for you than death.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.472
That's how pride works.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.808
Once you let it go, there's nothing left.

27:03.872 --> 27:04.706
Chairman Jo.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.542
JO ANNA

27:09.461 --> 27:10.629
What is it?

27:11.296 --> 27:13.632
No matter how hard you try,

27:13.715 --> 27:15.884
some things can't be separated
from a person.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.386
BORROWER: JO SHIN-IL
LENDER: PARK HYEONG-DO

27:19.512 --> 27:22.515
The truth and my money.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.354
No money in this world belongs to you.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.773
It says so right here in the ledger.

27:31.858 --> 27:35.528
It took me a long time
to recover what you hid.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.452
It takes a hundred years to build…

27:44.537 --> 27:47.290
but it all comes crashing down in a day.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.629
I'm not as forgiving as my father.

27:54.714 --> 27:58.093
Take care of yourself
until you pay all my money back.

28:06.559 --> 28:07.560
Thank you.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.649
You're going to regret this.

28:13.274 --> 28:16.486
The real regret
is what you're doing right now.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.242
I'll keep this money safe
for the time being.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.535
Take it all.

28:23.618 --> 28:24.994
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

28:46.725 --> 28:48.643
Screw superpowers.

28:49.352 --> 28:54.149
Losing them after having them
is even more exhausting,

28:54.691 --> 28:56.234
both physically and mentally.

29:15.003 --> 29:15.837
Min-suk?

29:21.760 --> 29:22.761
Min-suk?

29:25.805 --> 29:27.432
Hey, Min-suk!

29:28.183 --> 29:29.184
Hey, Min…

29:30.435 --> 29:31.436
Min-suk!

29:49.329 --> 29:50.163
Damn it.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.626
-Hello--
-I was really moved by what you said.

29:59.589 --> 30:00.590
Where is Min-suk?

30:09.891 --> 30:11.726
Sang-ung, I'm fine.

30:12.852 --> 30:14.062
So don't worry too much.

30:15.939 --> 30:16.773
Min-suk.

30:17.273 --> 30:18.274
Are you okay?

30:18.942 --> 30:20.652
Hang in there. I'll be there soon.

30:20.735 --> 30:21.653
Just a little…

30:22.153 --> 30:24.364
Why are you making things complicated?

30:27.700 --> 30:28.910
What do you want?

30:29.953 --> 30:31.454
It's always been you.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.123
Fine. Then I'll come to you.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.125
I'll be there, so let Min-suk…

30:37.961 --> 30:39.337
Hey!

30:39.838 --> 30:41.422
You fucking bastard!

30:41.506 --> 30:44.133
I said I'd come! I'm coming!

30:52.392 --> 30:54.060
That's for me to decide.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.063
You just wait quietly.

31:01.818 --> 31:02.861
Fuck.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.739
The person you called is unavailable.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.209
You think you're gonna win, don't you?

31:19.377 --> 31:21.296
You'll never be able
to beat Kang Sang-ung.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.840
Why do you think that?

31:26.342 --> 31:27.635
Sang-ung…

31:30.430 --> 31:31.806
He's not good at calculations.

31:33.641 --> 31:37.186
So he always ends up doing
everything he thinks is right.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.855
Even if it's impossible.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.481
Even if the odds are against him.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.733
I see.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.320
That's why that bastard is so broke.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.489
No. He never had any money to begin with.

31:51.200 --> 31:55.246
How could you possibly live with someone
who spends his own money helping others?

31:55.330 --> 31:57.665
Hey, you've got it backward.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.501
He puts up with someone like me
because he's a pushover.

32:01.002 --> 32:04.130
But I want him to be a pushover
only for me.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.466
How touching.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.760
Of course. We just got married.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.099
Right now, it feels like
you've stolen my husband.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.269
Our family meeting got ruined
because of you.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.813
We haven't even had our wedding!

32:26.986 --> 32:28.237
You're going to lose.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.531
Just wait and see.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.784
We'll find out who is right.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.265
Nobody move!

33:15.535 --> 33:17.954
Jo Nathan is selling power-copying drugs.

33:18.454 --> 33:19.497
We'll check it.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.582
No checking. We gotta go get that bastard.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.759
You didn't arrest anyone.
Why did you even go to Gimhae?

33:32.385 --> 33:33.970
What's going on right now?

33:38.141 --> 33:40.601
Kang Sang-ung. Why did you let him go?

33:43.062 --> 33:44.856
Because he did nothing wrong.

33:47.775 --> 33:50.403
He broke into a vault, and he's innocent?
Are you serious?

33:54.407 --> 33:55.491
Listen up, you guys.

33:55.575 --> 33:58.286
There's one thing in the world
that's worth more than money.

33:58.786 --> 33:59.620
Guess what it is.

34:01.372 --> 34:02.290
What?

34:04.751 --> 34:05.835
It's time.

34:08.171 --> 34:11.340
That's why we're always short on time.

34:40.703 --> 34:41.788
You look great.

34:52.298 --> 34:54.133
Don't be late next time.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.473
Where is Min-suk?

35:42.557 --> 35:45.434
Before we get to that,
I need to test something on you.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.533
What kind of test?

36:00.616 --> 36:02.034
You collapsed in the vault.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.662
If you're damaged goods,

36:05.163 --> 36:07.331
there's no need to waste our time.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.169
That's when I realized.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.504
If I don't have my superpowers,

36:13.588 --> 36:17.008
I'm completely useless to them.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.347
If you beat me,

36:24.182 --> 36:25.433
I'll take you to her.

36:27.059 --> 36:28.311
If you lose…

36:33.733 --> 36:34.942
you and that bitch

36:36.152 --> 36:37.403
will both end up dead.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.198
I'm sorry to say this,

36:40.990 --> 36:43.242
but I need to hear a fun story
from Min-suk.

36:44.702 --> 36:45.786
I can't die right now.

37:52.103 --> 37:52.937
Min-suk.

37:54.814 --> 37:55.815
Where is she?

38:39.275 --> 38:41.694
What's wrong?
You said you could see everything.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.498
Where is Min-suk?

38:59.253 --> 39:01.047
Where is Min-suk? Damn it!

39:09.972 --> 39:11.599
You really can't use it anymore?

39:13.476 --> 39:15.186
I should dispose of both of you.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.480
I have no business with you.

39:22.234 --> 39:23.235
So just tell me.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.364
Min-suk.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.116
Where is she?

39:32.036 --> 39:32.870
Die and meet her.

40:06.445 --> 40:08.614
Don't move,
or you'll get holes in your body.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.665
DIVORCE ATTORNEY BYEON HO-IN

41:03.085 --> 41:05.087
BEOMHA LOGISTICS

41:05.171 --> 41:06.088
It's here.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.390
BEOMHA LOGISTICS
FIRST FLOOR

41:16.974 --> 41:20.019
The Mundane Vanguard thugs
are guarding every entrance.

41:20.102 --> 41:21.228
HORIZONTAL CROSS SECTION

41:21.812 --> 41:23.397
The same would go for Min-suk.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.109
It's suicide to go in now.

41:33.991 --> 41:37.036
We're all gonna die.
Min-suk, and the rest of us too!

41:38.537 --> 41:40.164
Even with powers, it won't be easy.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.540
When we first met,

41:42.875 --> 41:44.877
you asked why I helped them, right?

41:45.461 --> 41:48.380
The people who were in the bus accident.

41:53.677 --> 41:56.305
I did it because I had to.
Do I need a reason?

41:57.598 --> 41:59.475
I would've done it without superpowers.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.352
One way or another.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.858
Willpower alone isn't enough.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.111
In this situation, nothing's adding up!

42:20.871 --> 42:22.456
I'm bad at things like calculations.

42:46.188 --> 42:49.984
BEOMHA LOGISTICS

43:21.807 --> 43:25.019
Now I kind of understand what Dad meant.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.565
My strength does not come from money.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.152
My strength comes out

43:33.652 --> 43:38.115
to protect something
more important than money.

44:11.357 --> 44:12.191
Min-suk,

44:13.984 --> 44:15.486
I won't be late this time.

47:21.129 --> 47:26.134
