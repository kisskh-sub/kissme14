00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.720
Just seeing their faces drives me crazy.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.160
Now I have to live
under the same roof as them.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.560
What are you doing? I'm not playing.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.400
I don't believe
Din and Ms. Sarah love each other.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.200
There has to be more to it.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.480
And from now on,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.920
I have to look at the woman I love
as my sister-in-law.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.480
Mr. Din, we have a big issue.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.520
If it's anyone else, I won't complain.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
But I'm never working
with someone like Chakrit.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.120
If I succeed, I get Din's position.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.880
That depends on your ability.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.480
Hey.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.520
If your brows are tied
in a knot like that,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.960
even botox won't save you now.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
I'm actually stressed, okay?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.680
I can't think of anything right now.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.080
If you can't, then don't think.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.360
Worrying won't fix anything,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.960
except give you wrinkles.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.240
You've already done everything you should.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.040
Let's just watch how things unfold

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.400
and deal with it as it comes.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.640
You're right.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.440
But I'm scared
we won't be able to fix it like you say.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.400
It's late. Worrying won't help.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.800
How about we do something fun
that gets your heart racing a little?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.680
Gets my heart racing?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.080
You sure?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.160
Unless you're scared.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.640
If you're scared,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.080
just say so.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.520
Come on. Got you.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.760
-Hey!
-Come here! Don't run!

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.760
Catch me if you can!

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.640
-There! I got you!
-What are you doing? Hey!

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.240
-Got you now!
-Hey!

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.920
-Let go of me!
-Not a chance. I'm not letting go.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.880
You're in trouble now.
You told me to catch you, didn't you?

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.880
Come on. Just a bit more.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.000
Here!

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.960
-Oh. Sara!
-Hey!

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.880
-Serves you right! I got you!
-Hey.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.520
You lost!

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.400
You lost!

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.240
You lost! Loser.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.280
Did you cheat? I caught you first.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.560
Nope.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.280
Again. One more round.
I'm not losing next time.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.040
You can play ten rounds,
you'll still lose.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.080
Even if your fingers go numb
pressing that hard,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.080
you're not beating me.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.400
Fine, I'm done.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.080
Of course, you're good at this game.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.600
Boo.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.800
Sore loser.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.960
I'm not playing the game anymore
because I'm playing this!

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.960
-I can't catch you in the game,
-Let go.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.960
so I'll catch you outside the game.
Giving up?

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.440
-Hey!
-What?

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.120
-Let me go right now.
-No.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.760
Come here. No, give it to me.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.040
No! Come here!

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.480
Give it to me.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.080
I…

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.440
I'm sleepy.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.480
I'm going to bed. You sleep on the floor.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.840
And why exactly do I have to sleep
on the floor? This is my room.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.160
Fine. I'll sleep on the floor.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.160
A small woman like me
sacrificing for a big guy like you,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.280
totally fine.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.360
Okay, okay. I'll sleep on the floor.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.200
I'll just sleep here.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.080
Wow!

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.640
So comfy…

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.080
Huge bed, soft mattress…

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.160
I can stretch however I want.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.360
So comfy… So soft…

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.920
How's the floor down there? Comfortable?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.120
Hey.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.480
PD GROUP ANNOUNCEMENT

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.480
EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION NOTICE

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.440
PD GROUP CO., LTD. IS TERMINATING

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.360
THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE LISTED STAFF

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.680
FOLLOWING STRUCTURAL

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.000
AND STABILITY REQUIREMENTS

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.240
CHAKRIT KOSONWATTANASATIT

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.960
What's going on?

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.200
Did you order some kind of announcement?

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.080
Why is everyone panicking?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.880
Uncle Perm,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.920
what's going on?

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.400
Mr. Chakrit ordered
the whole staff to be fired.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.280
What?

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.280
He fired the staff?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.080
Including me.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.720
Mr. Chakrit, what gives you the right

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.560
to fire my employees however you please?

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.760
Calm down, Mr. Pathawee.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.640
Why don't we sit down
and talk like civilized people?

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.400
Stop acting like a thug.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.920
Don't try to provoke me.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.920
Answer me. What authority do you have?

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.680
If I didn't have it,

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.760
could I do any of this?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.400
Right, Auntie?

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.960
You're the one

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.280
who gave me full authority

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.440
to make decisions in this company.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.520
Is that true, Mom?

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880
Well…

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.040
I only did what Mr. Praphop
and Ms. Rosarin wanted,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.560
to have Chakrit help manage the company.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.080
I just want to run this place at a profit.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.280
Cutting the old-timers

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.600
or people with overlapping roles,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.760
that's the right move, isn't it?

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.520
Saves the company tons of money.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.240
And how are they supposed to live?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.440
Losing their jobs at this age?

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.240
That's their problem, not mine.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.240
My problem is I'm a shareholder.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.240
If this company loses money,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.480
I lose too.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.960
So, anything that brings profit,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.760
I'll do.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.560
This is your management?

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.600
No wonder the company would collapse.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.640
I'm sorry we had to meet online today.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.680
Everything happened so suddenly.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.040
But I promise
you'll receive fair compensation.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.080
And when things get better,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.520
I'll bring everyone back.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.880
I hope we'll meet again soon.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.560
Mr. Din, I'll head off now.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.560
Take care, Uncle Perm.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.080
The one who needs to take care

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.880
is you, Mr. Din.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.400
The people who were fired,

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.680
they're loyal to you.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.640
This is only the beginning.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.160
Who knows what Mr. Chakrit will do next.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.240
I'll take my leave now.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.680
What?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.360
Cancel the gift set project?

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.160
Yes.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.520
You heard it right.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.280
I looked at the report.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.000
It's not worth it.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.360
The profit per unit is tiny.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.760
A waste of time.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.320
But we already invested in R&amp;D.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.680
Canceling now means
everything we did goes to waste.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.640
Then let it be wasted.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.520
I'm not approving the launch.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.640
I disagree.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.520
I've poured everything into this.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.680
You can't just cancel it like that.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.040
Why not?

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.680
I have the authority.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.880
And you,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.000
you're just an employee.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.960
Though,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.400
being the CEO's wife is a small perk.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.680
But it still doesn't give you
decision-making power.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.280
You don't have the authority either,
Mr. Chakrit.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.960
I'm the one who approved this.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.200
My decision stands.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.640
You don't get to overturn it freely.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.960
I won't interfere with what you do.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.520
But what I do

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.680
is none of your business.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.560
I won't argue, Mr. CEO.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.160
But I want to know.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.160
If this project gets launched

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.560
and ends up being a loss,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.040
how exactly

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.120
will you take responsibility?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.200
I'll resign as CEO.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.600
That's what you wanted to hear, right?

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.720
I'll say it for you.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800
Mr. Din!

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.280
How could you gamble
with something like that?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.520
Do you know how risky that is?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.840
Well, it's because I trust you.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.880
Or…

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.640
do you not trust yourself?

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.480
I trust that I've done my very best.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.800
The gift set is high-quality.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.200
But I can't guarantee sales.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.040
There are too many variables,
you know that.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.520
Come on.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.000
If I lose,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.440
I'll just resign.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.120
Who are you?

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.000
Spit the real him back out.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.400
I'm serious.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.280
Normally, you cling to your company
like your life depends on it.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.000
Now suddenly, you're all zen?

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.760
How am I not supposed to be suspicious?

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.440
Who was it yesterday that said,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.600
"We've done everything we can.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.920
All that's left is to deal
with things as they come?"

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.240
Mr. Din…

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.400
It's okay.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.200
Just fight through this together.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.760
Alright.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.280
Fine.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.280
Worst case, we lose our jobs together.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.120
And when that day comes,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.680
you're taking care of me, okay?

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.200
Need any incense
to offer food to your spirit?

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.720
What are you even talking about?

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.160
You ordered food
and left it sitting there.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.720
No way you'll get full.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.080
I lost my appetite.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.480
I ordered it, so you wouldn't nag
about me sitting here all day.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.520
Why?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.720
What happened?
Why are you hiding out here?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.319
I don't wanna go home.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.440
I don't wanna go to the office.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.040
I don't wanna see certain things.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.400
Hurts to look at, huh?

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.760
Yeah.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.839
If I were you,

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.440
I'd go help Ms. Sarah.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.720
Because Din and Ms. Sarah
are getting hit hard right now.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.680
Getting hit?

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.840
Chakrit's in PD now,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.600
and he'll do anything

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.040
to push Din and Ms. Sarah out.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.480
And you're here collapsing in a heap.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.320
If I were Ms. Sarah,
I wouldn't pick you either.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.600
But they're married now.
What do you want me to do?

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.840
You're the one who said you don't believe
they love each other.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.640
So, why not try again?

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.840
Prove yourself to Ms. Sarah.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.960
Show her you have value.
Show her you can protect her.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.200
Marketing?

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.000
I'll help with the marketing
for the gift set launch.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.880
That's good.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.000
It's good you're helping.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.880
So, tell me. What's your plan?

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.360
What I was thinking is…

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.680
Our target group is working women.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.720
We sell at an affordable price.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.400
Market through social media.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.080
Use influencers on every platform,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.240
Facebook, TikTok, YouTube.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.520
Then run promos,

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.840
giveaways, get traction fast.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.920
Great idea.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.240
But… too bad.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.560
Why, Ms. Sarah?

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.360
Because everything you just said…

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.920
we already did.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.120
But…

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.720
I like your ideas.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.080
We just happened to do them already.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.320
Try coming up with something new, okay?

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.280
Yes.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.240
Thank you.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.280
You'll think of something.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.160
I'm just glad

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.280
you want to help the company.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.800
Oh, and…

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.520
What was your new product again?

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.680
Men's grooming.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.560
Men care more about themselves now,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.880
and they're spending more too.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.520
Any suggestions?

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.080
Lip balm?

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.080
Interesting.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.440
You two match perfectly, huh?

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.440
Thanks.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.440
APO

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.080
I don't want to stay at home right now.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.520
I'm going to be
somewhere else for a while.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.480
Don't worry, Mom.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.680
I'll come back when I'm ready.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.400
Nam…

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.960
Nam…

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.520
How long are you going
to worry your mother?

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.440
Because of you and your wife,

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.080
Nam can't stay in this house anymore.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.560
Sara and I had nothing to do with this.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.360
We've been buried in work every day.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.240
Just yesterday, I was happy because
Nam said he'd help out at the company.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.720
Who knew he'd suddenly run away?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.440
He's heartbroken, that's why.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.200
You two stick together like glue.
Who could possibly get over that?

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.080
The one who wanted me to marry Sara,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.840
to live with her like a real couple,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.160
so Nam would move on was you, wasn't it?

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.880
So, how is any of this suddenly my fault?

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.040
Everything I do is wrong.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.080
Or do you want me to divorce Sara now?

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.400
Maybe then Nam will come home.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.320
Don't you dare get sarcastic with me.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.280
How was I supposed to know
he'd pull this stunt?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.760
I thought he'd just marry Nina.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.480
Now he's run off, what do we do?

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.840
If Nam doesn't marry Nina,

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.680
the company won't survive anyway.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.920
Thank you.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.520
No one knows where he is.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.400
I called every friend he has.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.960
You don't need to worry about Nam.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.160
He's not a kid.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.120
He can take care of himself.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.640
Right now,
we have something more important

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.280
to focus on.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.480
Our gift set's
officially on the shelves today.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.000
Right.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.360
The launch got decent attention.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.240
But today

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.600
decides whether we stay or collapse.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.280
GIFT SET COLLECTION DAILY SALES REPORT

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.320
Chakrit reported that day-one sales

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.040
fell short of target by 40%.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.240
Basically a disaster.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.560
If it keeps going like this, we win.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.320
At this rate,

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.640
we'll get the capital back in five years.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.240
Aren't you expecting too much?

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.640
You let Chakrit handle the management,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.840
but he made his money trading stocks.
He's never actually run a business.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.200
You trust him that much?

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.040
Trust him?

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.040
Who would trust a snake like him?

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.440
We're just using him
in exchange for the position he wants.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.520
Once the job is done, we toss him.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.880
I never should've trusted you two.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.560
You pushed for that gift set,
and look where we are now.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.760
Forget profits,
we can't even recoup the cost.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.800
Mother, please don't stress yet.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.600
It's only day one.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.200
We still have a chance.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.120
Yeah, Mom. Let's wait a bit more.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.040
Don't defend her.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.160
Everyone knows she spearheaded this mess.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.680
I was foolish to think

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.680
the apple would fall far from the tree.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.920
The father's useless.
Why would the daughter be any better?

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.800
Mom!

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.360
Tell me where I'm wrong.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.320
If they were good at anything,

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.960
would Suthee have relied on your father?

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.720
He was a burden once,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.920
and now his daughter
is following right behind.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.600
-Excuse me?
-I told you.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.040
I put my position on the line.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.560
If this fails, I'll resign.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.120
You lose nothing.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.560
So, why are you the one panicking?

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.840
Fine. I'll enjoy watching
how you get yourself out of this.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.920
Are you… okay?

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.560
You've been standing here spacing out.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.440
I don't feel good about this.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.640
It's all so much pressure.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.600
You once told me,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.800
"If we've done everything we can,
we won't regret anything."

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.080
And you have done everything.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.600
Yes.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.800
Can I borrow your shoulder?

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.600
Of course.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.480
Thank you.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.680
Nam, where are you?

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.240
I'm worried about you.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.960
Your family, your mom,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.240
your brothers,
they're all worried about you.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.640
Your company's in real trouble now.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.040
If nothing changes,

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.320
Din will have to resign
to take responsibility.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.480
If you're reading this,

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.520
I want you to come back and help him.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.480
At least come back for emotional support.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.200
Right now, you're the person
he wants to see the most.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.160
If you still won't come back,

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.560
I'll curse you with chilies and salt,
I swear.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.360
Don't test me, idiot.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.720
Always make people worry.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.640
The numbers speak for themselves.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.800
It's been a full month,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.200
and nothing has improved.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.720
For the gift set project,

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.480
the revenue doesn't even cover the costs.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.960
To put it simply, it tanked.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.560
Well?

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.920
Anything you'd like to say, Mr. CEO?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.480
I already said I'd take responsibility.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.760
A man like me

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.040
keeps his word.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.680
So, it's over then.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.600
Ms. Sarah!

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.280
Something big just happened.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.960
What is it?

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.640
Did Mr. Din resign?

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.600
No. Look at this.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.880
Thank you, everyone,

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.920
for all your hard work.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.600
But it seems my ability

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.160
can only take the company this far.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.680
It's time to find someone

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.920
more capable

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.600
to take the lead.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.000
From now on, I will…

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.320
Hold on.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.480
Let me make an announcement.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.280
Right now,

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.600
our sales have tripled.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.760
Both online and offline.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.400
And they're still climbing.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.080
That means our launch

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.960
was a success.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.520
I'll show you the texture now.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.760
Whoa…

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.680
It absorbs so fast!

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.960
And the scent is so nice.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.160
It really helps with skin problems.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.200
They've even got a full line,

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.240
serums, big bottles too.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.480
This is PD Group's line.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.560
Honestly,
nothing beats this value right now.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.920
Affordable and good, here!

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.920
-Look! It absorbs so well.
-Nice! I want to try it.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.840
Me too.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.720
WEEKLY SALES

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.840
Here are our sales
for the entire first month,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.960
with projections still rising.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.920
This is record-breaking for our company.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.200
So, we're safe now?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:03.960
Yes.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.120
What the hell is going on?

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.520
Didn't you say Din would be out by now?!

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.760
I didn't think he'd flip the game

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.520
and turn sales around like that.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.040
Apparently, the products are really good.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.480
Word of mouth blew up.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.560
Got another plan?

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.719
I'll look into options.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.040
Meaning you don't have one yet.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:39.880
Stop wasting time with excuses.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.440
Just kick him out directly.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.679
Fire Din from the CEO position?

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.080
Even combined, my shares don't beat his,

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.960
plus his brother's and his mother's.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.840
That's more than half.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.639
We can't win by voting.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.920
That's why I tried forcing him to resign.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.640
Your shares don't beat Din's,

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.440
but that's not all we have.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.040
We don't need to rely on you
for everything.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.920
Right, Chakrit?

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.320
What does that mean?

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.120
Cheers to our success.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.040
Honestly,

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.440
it doesn't need to stay this high forever.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.160
If we keep
even half this performance all year,

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.560
we'll clear all our debt
within three years.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.280
Such sweet dreams.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.480
It's called

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.520
planning for the future.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.760
Stop. Tonight we celebrate.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.640
Don't think that far ahead.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.880
Hey.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.640
Go easy. You'll get drunk.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.480
Why?

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.200
You're the lightweight, not me.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.560
Health-conscious guy,
sipping wine like he's scared of it.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.440
Oh yeah?

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.160
Let's see who can hold their liquor.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.640
Excuse me.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.160
This is the surprise you mentioned?

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.640
Yep.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.440
I picked this place

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.520
for this amazing view.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.040
-Oh…
-Hey, hey.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.720
You okay?

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.320
You're starting to get drunk.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.040
Says the guy

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.280
who's drunk himself.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.920
I'm not drunk.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.920
I'm so happy!

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.640
Hey, hey, careful.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.040
Watch it.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.000
You're drunk. You're gonna fall.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.240
I'm not.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.080
If you don't believe me,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.440
look at me up close.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.240
I propose we replace the CEO

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.600
to align with the company's new policy.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.640
If I get to watch you people
crash and burn…

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.680
That alone is satisfying enough, Din.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.720
Mind your own business.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.960
Why are you so stubborn?

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.840
Are you really that afraid of losing?

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.320
You think I'm that kind of man?

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.040
Thanks, Baicha,
for helping me out with this.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.040
I do have one condition though.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.200
You have to divorce Ms. Sarah.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.200
