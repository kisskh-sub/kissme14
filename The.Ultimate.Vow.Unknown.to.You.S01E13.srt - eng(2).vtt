(A Celestial Realm of Joy)

00:01:23.137 --> 00:01:25.507
We have a few skilled performers today.

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:27.445
Please enjoy yourselves.

00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:35.136
Young Lady Shen, bear with it for now.

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:38.407
You'll need to smile beautifully later.

00:01:48.417 --> 00:01:49.236
Your Ladyship,

00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:50.256
everything is ready.

00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:51.870
The final show

00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:54.058
is about to begin.

00:02:03.137 --> 00:02:03.978
Isn't that

00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:06.297
Madam Su?

00:02:12.787 --> 00:02:14.427
A boat courtesan's daughter.

00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:17.286
She's indeed inherited
her mother's lowly fate.

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:18.406
True, though.

00:02:18.658 --> 00:02:20.482
She's probably trying to return

00:02:20.537 --> 00:02:22.418
to where she truly belongs.

00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:25.016
Wasn't your mother

00:02:25.017 --> 00:02:26.818
climbing her way up

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:28.273
with her face

00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:30.497
and her body?

00:02:30.498 --> 00:02:32.777
Your Ladyship, you seem to know
my mother's past very well.

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:35.138
Did you investigate for a long time?

00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:38.420
For today's show,

00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:40.870
you planned all this long ago.

00:02:41.457 --> 00:02:43.007
The drug is ready.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.432
The stage is set.

00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:48.620
All that's left is to put me on display.

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:50.136
Do you all know

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:51.456
why the Princess

00:02:51.457 --> 00:02:53.407
brought me onto this stage tonight?

00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:57.657
I knew you'd use this trick.

00:02:57.658 --> 00:02:58.749
That's why

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.230
I've been waiting here.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.082
The Breath-Holding Technique
lies in calming the mind.

00:03:04.898 --> 00:03:06.832
Feel the flow of breath in your body.

00:03:07.297 --> 00:03:08.107
Yes.

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:09.757
Like that.

00:03:09.818 --> 00:03:12.897
But my heart

00:03:13.618 --> 00:03:15.017
won't calm down.

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:18.777
That's because you keep looking at me.

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:20.582
Concentrate.

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:22.382
I...

00:03:23.498 --> 00:03:25.817
Remember this. No matter what danger
you face in the future,

00:03:25.818 --> 00:03:27.617
this technique can save your life.

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:28.807
Practice it well.

00:03:29.338 --> 00:03:30.658
Focus.

00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:35.962
Tomorrow,

00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:38.220
I'll give you a fine show.

00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:40.432
What are you talking about?

00:03:40.457 --> 00:03:41.736
Today,

00:03:41.737 --> 00:03:43.411
I'll show everyone

00:03:43.412 --> 00:03:44.337
what

00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:46.082
true dancing is.

00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:03.932
(A Celestial Realm of Joy)

00:04:31.298 --> 00:04:33.777
Good!

00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:37.417
Good!

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:57.857
I've never seen such graceful dance.

00:04:57.858 --> 00:04:59.818
There's no trace of vulgarity at all.

00:04:59.858 --> 00:05:02.195
She looks like an immortal
from the heavens.

00:05:12.087 --> 00:05:13.970
(A Celestial Realm of Joy)

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:27.298
Good!

00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:31.017
Good!

00:05:31.094 --> 00:05:32.895
Good!

00:05:34.137 --> 00:05:34.777
Good!

00:05:34.818 --> 00:05:35.957
Excellent!

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.070
My mother taught me

00:05:40.978 --> 00:05:42.498
to conduct myself with dignity

00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:44.407
and to dance with sincerity.

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:46.657
Even as a boat courtesan,

00:05:46.738 --> 00:05:48.695
one must live with integrity.

00:05:48.818 --> 00:05:50.336
She may be a boat courtesan,

00:05:50.337 --> 00:05:53.095
but she lived honestly
through her own skill.

00:05:53.298 --> 00:05:54.932
That's better than some people

00:05:55.412 --> 00:05:57.092
who are born noble

00:05:57.298 --> 00:05:58.776
but act despicably.

00:05:58.777 --> 00:05:59.577
You!

00:05:59.697 --> 00:06:01.457
Good!

00:06:01.897 --> 00:06:03.217
Good!

00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:06.337
Good!

00:06:10.097 --> 00:06:12.618
Good!

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:17.577
Good!

00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:23.977
Good!

00:06:30.498 --> 00:06:31.417
You wench!

00:06:31.418 --> 00:06:32.696
Stop putting on airs.

00:06:32.697 --> 00:06:35.011
Since you look down on my dancing,

00:06:35.012 --> 00:06:37.216
why not dance yourself?

00:06:37.217 --> 00:06:38.537
Who do you think you are

00:06:38.777 --> 00:06:40.432
to order me around?

00:06:43.217 --> 00:06:44.776
If you think

00:06:44.777 --> 00:06:46.470
her skills are lacking,

00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:49.058
you must be exceptional yourself.

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:51.220
Why not have a fair contest

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:52.957
in front of everyone here?

00:06:55.662 --> 00:06:57.645
This dance costume you're wearing

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:00.332
looks rather familiar.

00:07:06.337 --> 00:07:08.241
How brazen of you.

00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:10.560
You're actually wearing the phoenix robe
of a crown princess.

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:12.776
Have you gone mad dreaming of
becoming a crown princess?

00:07:12.777 --> 00:07:13.656
You wench!

00:07:13.657 --> 00:07:15.370
How dare you frame me!

00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:18.865
There's no need for me
to say more, right?

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:28.403
Qingru.

00:07:28.457 --> 00:07:30.360
There's no need to trouble yourself,
Your Highness.

00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:32.298
I'm just a boat courtesan's daughter

00:07:32.657 --> 00:07:34.370
who isn't worthy of your concern.

General Su's body hasn't been found yet.

00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:50.456
I afraid the dungeon...

00:07:50.457 --> 00:07:51.799
No one should know about this.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.707
Yes.

00:07:56.538 --> 00:07:57.557
Come out.

00:08:00.738 --> 00:08:02.298
Where did you lock him up?

00:08:04.378 --> 00:08:06.138
Even if he's still alive,

00:08:07.058 --> 00:08:08.258
what can you do?

00:08:12.437 --> 00:08:13.637
You still

00:08:14.017 --> 00:08:15.820
can't let him go?

00:08:36.618 --> 00:08:37.417
Let go.

00:08:37.418 --> 00:08:38.332
Don't move.

00:08:41.325 --> 00:08:42.061
You're insane.

00:08:42.062 --> 00:08:43.032
Let go.

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:51.218

I heard Young Lady Shen
went to bathe earlier.

00:09:43.778 --> 00:09:45.098
Your Highness, could it be

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:46.338
that your injury...

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:47.856
Young Lady Shen is strong-willed.

00:09:47.857 --> 00:09:49.697
She probably won't treat you sincerely.

00:09:50.418 --> 00:09:51.218
Who's there?

00:09:54.097 --> 00:09:56.216
Since you care so much for His Highness,

00:09:56.217 --> 00:09:58.817
why don't you take care of him?

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.738
Why are you here?

00:10:02.187 --> 00:10:03.546
You wench!

00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:05.382
Get out.

00:10:07.097 --> 00:10:08.607
What did I do wrong?

00:10:08.857 --> 00:10:09.976
She's just a lowly woman!

00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:11.757
I said get out.

00:10:12.658 --> 00:10:14.482
What am I lacking compared to her?

00:10:15.058 --> 00:10:16.817
I'm a Princess.

00:10:16.818 --> 00:10:18.532
- She's nothing but a lowly...
- Shut up!

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.282
You don't deserve to speak of her.

00:10:20.457 --> 00:10:21.907
Get out.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.149
Bring me some aphrodisiac powder.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.817
Your Ladyship, but

00:10:43.818 --> 00:10:45.177
this goes against the rules.

00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:46.220
Rules?

00:10:46.962 --> 00:10:49.349
This fine mutton-fat jade bracelet

00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:51.870
matters more than any rules.

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:00.449
Your Ladyship,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.297
this Longbi Incense is very strong.

00:11:02.298 --> 00:11:04.020
Be careful when using it.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.280
Thank you for your reminder,
imperial physician.

Something's with this liquor.

Shen Qingru,

00:12:01.538 --> 00:12:03.338
didn't you want to see His Highness?

00:12:03.577 --> 00:12:06.376
Tonight, I especially
brought him to you.

00:12:06.377 --> 00:12:07.670
What did you do to him?

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:08.937
Me?

00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:11.378
What could I possibly do?

00:12:12.977 --> 00:12:14.858
I merely let His Highness taste

00:12:15.298 --> 00:12:17.670
the bitterness of love.
