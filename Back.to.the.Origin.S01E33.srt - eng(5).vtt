Xiaohe's on board.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.360
She'll remove

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.720
the post tomorrow

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.840
and issue a statement.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.720
Once

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.079
that's done

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.120
and we clean things up

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.040
PR-wise,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.440
we can put this behind us.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.000
We should

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.280
head in now.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.440
You don't get it,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.920
this isn't going away.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.680
I'm being followed.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.000
Right there,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.920
hiding,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.920
watching.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.720
They found

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720
my place.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.880
Everyone has it...

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.680
It's all over the internet.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.440
Here,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.320
here,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.840
everywhere...

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.320
here...

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.720
- All over...
- Easy.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.480
Just breathe.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.520
It's OK.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880
Trust me,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.320
It'll die down soon.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.360
It's OK.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.400
It's OK.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.640
I've got you.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.079
After the livestream tonight,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920
I'll drive you home.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.320
Promise.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.800
Drive me home, really?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.320
I will.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.680
You mean it?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.360
I do.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.040
I'll stay with you.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.720
We can't cancel it.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.400
This is her first show since

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.080
she peaked.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.680
The sponsors are all here.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.480
I barely

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.640
convinced them to stay.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.560
It's non-negotiable.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.240
She's completely

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.520
falling apart!

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.079
[She can't take]

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.240
[any more pressure.]

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.600
[Those trolls]

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.480
[and hate comments]

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.800
[are eating her alive.]

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.920
[She's totally checked out!]

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.640
[She is]

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.920
[our talent,]

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.400
[we need to have her back!]

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.360
[If she goes live like this,]

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.880
[it'll be a train wreck,]

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.920
and our reputation

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.480
will tank!

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.159
Stay with her.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.720
Keep her in check.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.800
If we cancel it,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.640
we'll be in debt forever

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.760
with these penalties.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.760
Anran,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.880
you've been crushing it.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.160
We've overcome

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.480
so many challenges together.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.680
My trust

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.640
in you is absolute,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.920
far beyond

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.080
what I have in myself.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.240
This is just

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.920
a minor hurdle from fate.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.960
Clear this,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.920
and you'll reach Lady Wan's level.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.080
What's gonna happen

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.360
if I bail on this?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.920
I think you already know.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.440
Time for some magic!

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.680
Watch one become five!

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.480
Spicy!

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.720
Sawadika!

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.760
Time to win big!

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.120
And look here,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120
grab your voucher

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.000

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.880
20 Yuan off!

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.360
Are you

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.800
ready, guys?

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.200

click the link!

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.160
C'mon,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.440
folks!

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.640
Link one is limited to

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.400
5,000 orders only.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.640
Grab yours now!

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.560
Here's

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.120
everyone's favorite,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.240
perfect for

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.360
snacking straight

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.120
from the pack!

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.800
C'mon,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.080
let's give it a try!

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.600
Yeah,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.840
since they're

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.320
baked

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.520
instead of fried,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.840
you can just munch on them.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.880
But add water,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.400
and you'll

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.600
get this whole flavor experience.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.000
Yeah, water takes it

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.480
to the next level.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480
Let's grab some water

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.480
and a bowl.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.200
We'll see

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.080
how amazing

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.280
these taste,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.840
yeah?

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.760
Let's

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.000
prep it,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.480
and

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.760
Anran'll give it a try.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.640
Sounds good?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.280
You can just snack it dry!

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.080
Hey...

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.800
[Delete them now!]

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.000
[On it!]

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.120
[Hey, the bowl...]

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.400
[One sec, folks!]

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.760
[Let me open this up...]

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.360
Hey, Anran...

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.400
That's the

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.280
old package...

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.440
[Got the munchies, huh?]

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.520
[Sure, eat it dry...]

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.320
[but...]

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.520
[Anran? Anran...]

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.040
Mr. Lin,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.000
someone's taking

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.080
her home.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.920
She won't be

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.280
alone tonight.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.920
The sponsors...

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.040
How are you gonna

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.680
handle this disaster?

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.680
So...

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.800
I told you to

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.120
keep her in check.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.040
Well?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.360
You're running things

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.480
around here.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.920
We're going public!

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.640
I made it clear

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.080
how crucial this live was,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160
and you

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.000
blew it all up!

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.600
Let me go...

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.840
I spent years building this

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.520
from scratch,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.200
supporting everyone here,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.680
and you

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.680
managed to tank it in days...

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.200
I tanked it?

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.400
Lin Chang,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.360
cut to the chase.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.440
Want me to quit

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.360
and be

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.320
your scapegoat?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.400
Been thinking

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.520
firing you would

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.480
show accountability,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.680
but I just can't PULL THE TRIGGER!

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.160
Stop imitating me!

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.240
Just can't bring myself to it!

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.040
I imitate you, so what?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.440
Try talk normal!

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.560
You're slow

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.480
and clumsy with words!

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.320
Everyone here

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.600
mocks how you talk!

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.160
Hey,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.200
we should hire

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.000
a streamer to mimic you!

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.440
Your incompetence

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.080
and ego

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.600
wrecked everything!

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.560
Now you're playing

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.400
the blame game!

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.480
Be a man!

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.520
Outrageous!

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.920
Get out!

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.440
Dream on about your IPO!

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.440
Everything's toast,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.160
what good is a scapegoat now?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:25.760
OUT! GET OUT!

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.920
You're screwed!

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.920
OUT!

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.920
Go see a doctor!

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.080
[Mr. Lin, what is it?]

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.840
Zhang Ran,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.840
have you heard

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.320
what happened to Anran?

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.800
[Just got filled in.]

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.280
I feel terrible.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.760
First you, now her.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.560
[It's eating me up.]

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.080
Don't beat yourself up.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.480
It's not on you.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.040
[I've been thinking hard.]

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.520
I put too much faith in Qian Dan.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.920
[She threw you under the bus]

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.360
[thinking it would save Anran,]

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.920
[but]

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.680
[it ruined both of you.]

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.200
You're all

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.040
family to me.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.560
I've always seen you

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.960
as my children.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.120
[But Qian Dan]

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.760
[only saw numbers and profits.]

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.360
She never got it.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.960
I never

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.800
managed to change

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.040
her perspective.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.560
That's my failure.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.160
Honestly,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.480
I understand

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.120
Ms. Qian's position,

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.880
yeah...

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.440
[I can't understand it.]

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.920
[She's gone now.]

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.920
[When crisis hit,]

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.640
she didn't protect

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.840
either of you.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.240
Real talk,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.320
after you deleted your account,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.840
I couldn't sleep for days.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.160
trying to find a way to help,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.640
but you impressed me,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.880
[fighting your way]

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.400
[back up alone.]

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.320
Nah,

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.360
my new account's

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.280
barely making it.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.160
Not even

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.640
half my old following.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.280
Zhang Ran,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.600
your resilience is remarkable.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.640
You've earned

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.320
every bit of your success.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.840
Would you return

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.760
and help me out?

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.160
You're my only hope now.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.000
I...

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.480
[If something's holding you back...]

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.000
No, no,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.280
that's not it.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.200
Just...

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.120
[wasn't expecting this.]

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.440
[Kinda surprised.]

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.280
Mind if I...

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.000
think it over?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.520
Need to process this.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.400
Perfect!

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.440
Can't wait to

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.160
have you back!

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.560
Hi.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.120
Hello,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.240
is this Lin Anran's place?

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.160
May I ask who you are?

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.320
I'm her friend,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.760
coming to visit.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.720
This is for her.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.080
OK, just a sec.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:55.960
Alright.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.720
Come on in.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.720
Heard

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.560
lots of people quit.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.680
Everyone thinks

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.040
they did you wrong.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.200
Can we...

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.880
avoid company talk?

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.480
OK.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.160
Take a sip.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:12.760
Yeah.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.200
Sweet, right?

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.400
It's good.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.680
Zhang Ran,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.280
you're

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.040
the first coworker to visit.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.480
Though honestly,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.720
this place ain't feel like home.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.600
The housekeeper's here

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.240
more than I am.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.040
Anran,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.320
your courtyard's really nice.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.120
While you're resting,

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.600
should make

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.520
the most of it.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.320
Sunlight is healing.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.240
Look,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.040
that's

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.000
a red plumeria tree.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.520
Ever seen one?

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.560
Yeah.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.080
You have?

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.120
Yeah.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.400
Never saw one before.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.080
Can't even name

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.320
half the plants in my yard.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.600
There are so many,

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.880
all unknown to me.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.960
Gotta get to

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.200
know them now.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.080
Remember

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.360
I told you

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.040
followers were the real friends?

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.520
I was wrong.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.040
Lost all my followers,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.040
but found a true friend instead.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.400
Me too.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.760
This true friend

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.880
should visit more.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.320
Anran,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.480
just wanted to check on you.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.640
Glad you're OK.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.839
I'll head out.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:09.920
Take it easy.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:13.880
Zhang Ran,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.520
I'm grateful.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.079
Take care.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.160
See you.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.880
[Cost price, wild-caught.]

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.480
[I'll have some.]

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.120
[Weigh it right, yeah?]

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.880
[Sure!]

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.320
[54, ma'am.]

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.040
[OK.]

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:32.840
[Alrighty.]

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.880
[OK.]

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.120
Anything else?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.120
Got snails.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.120
Looks good.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.000
Here's 16 back.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.280
See you soon, ma'am!

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:41.960
Thanks!

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.600
Here's the money.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.280
OK, one sec.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.640
Hey, Zhang Ran!

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.280
Let me get you some crabs.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.840
No, thanks,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.640
don't bother.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.600
OK.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.760
Hey, what's up?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.560
Finish up first,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.800
just want a quick chat.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.960
Yeah, sure.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.960
Let's move over there,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.720
smells better.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.760
Just letting you know.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.720
Company wants me back.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.360
Still thinking it through.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.320
Wanted your take on it.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.680
That's great.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.600
But

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.920
it's your call.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.080
Can't decide

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.920
this one for you,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.520
right?

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.440
I came hoping

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.480
you'd go back

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.000
with me.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.560
It'd put my mind at ease.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.320
But watching

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.280
you work,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.240
seeing how content you are...

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.120
It's a personal call indeed.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.240
Truth is,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.400
I'm surprised

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.840
how much I love this.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.800
That old job?

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.720
Wasn't clicking.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:48.680
Hated it.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.480
Felt like hard work

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.520
meant nothing.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:52.800
Feel you.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.480
This is different.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.000
Work hard, see results.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.160
After what went down last time,

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.200
still

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.440
bugs me though.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.960
I deleted the App, too.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.680
But

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.720
you're special.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.200
You know your path.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.960
Just do what feels

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.440
right,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.680
y'know?

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:19.840
Got it.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.640
Keep doing

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.120
what makes you happy.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.120
Will do.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.440
If someday, big if,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.680
you change your mind,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.880
you're always welcome.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.000
Thanks.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.200
Since you're all set,

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.760
here, something sweet.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.400
Got this from an old lady

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:42.960
this morning.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.800
Let this pop

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.240
bring you good fortune!

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200
Take care, Bo.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.080
Keep in touch.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:55.720
OK.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.000
Goodbye then.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.240
OK.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:00.960
Hey.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.760
Rock it!

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.320
Yeah.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.320
Mr. Lin!

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.200
Thanks!

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.040
Welcome home.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.960
Thanks, Boss!

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.320
I'm...ah, flattered...

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.520
Alright.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.680
Welcome home, Ran!

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680
Hi, guys!

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.200
Ran, welcome home!

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.280
Welcome home!

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.040
Been a while.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.440
Hey, hi!

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.360
Welcome back!

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.000
Hey, hey!

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.920
Welcome back!

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480
Whoa!

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.120
Hi everyone!

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.120
Long time no see.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.680
Hello, hello!

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.760
Where to?

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.160
Ran, welcome home!

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.680
Thank you so much!

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040
Welcome home!

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.200
Thanks guys!

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.040
Let's do it!

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.080
Do it!

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.440
You're the most captain-like person

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.960
I know.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.200
Not sure how long

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.040
I can keep playing captain.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.800
The real storm's arrived.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.480
Without Anran,

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.920
we've lost substantial business.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.520
Wanna help me

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.600
run this ship?

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.920
Not built for that.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.880
You've got this!

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.240
Since you brought me back,

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.680
you've got my full support!

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.920
Rough times

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.680
reveal true allies!

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.280
Zhang Ran,

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.440
I got it all sorted out.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.000
First thing we gotta do

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.000
is to build your new image

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.600
on what you've

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.280
already got.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.160
Keep your old fans,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.240
grab new ones.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.600
Most importantly,

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.640
finding your

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.120
selling niche.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.920
Clearer the niche,

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.120
better the money.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.560
Check this out.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.560
That's a lot!

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.680
I listed all the

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.200
trending personas.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.160
Take a look.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.880
First up: rich pretty girl.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.600
Rich pretty girl...

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:34.880
Nah...

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.840
Their followers

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.200
want

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.720
that lifestyle.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.360
Got it.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.240
So it sells well.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.200
I was comedy before.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.760
It doesn't really work.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.040
True.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.720
Check out option two.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.160
OK.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.200
Perfect mom.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.040
Chinese folks are crazy about kids.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.800
They'll be frugal themselves

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.320
but spend big on kids.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:57.880
Yeah,

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.800
but I've got no kids.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.920
Make one!

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:01.720
Ugh...

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.600
That's not...

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600
something that...

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.760
happens instantly...

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.960
When they're older,

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.680
you can do education stuff,

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.680
then have another,

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.680
maybe three!

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.000
Kids aren't my thing...

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.680
How come?

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.080
I can't do it.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.200
You can't?

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.760
Or your husband can't?

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.960
No, not physical inability...

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.040
moral inability.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.360
Having a kid just

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.680
to sell stuff...

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.440
Er,

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.600
not fair to the kid,

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.120
you know?

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.760
So what?

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.720
Kid's not doing the selling,

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.320
you're selling 'cause

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.480
you're a mom.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.240
Yeah well...

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.720
you've reworded it,

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.160
but it's still the same deal.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.160
Just think it over.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:42.720
Fine.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.200
Now for option three,

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.080
angry wife.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.240
Oh yeah, I know these.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.920
Seen these creators.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.600
Ranting about husbands

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.800
and in-laws.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.080
Some women

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.520
feel stuck,

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.720
we speak

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.240
for them online.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.480
Already promised him

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.560
I'd lay off these.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.440
Poor guy's got

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.640
a breaking point.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.880
Skip it for now.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:06.960
How about this?

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.440
"Strong independent woman,"

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.120
might work for me.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.200
That was

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.000
meant for Lin Anran.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.440
She was gonna be

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.280
a mix of types one and four.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:19.960
Got it,

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.680
rich pretty strong woman.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.320
But you'd do it better.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.560
You've got that comeback story.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.600
Your journey's gone viral.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.560
Let's do that then.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.280
But there's a catch...

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.160
What?

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.400
You're married.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.160
Can't even hide it.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.600
Wait, so marriage

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.120
cancels out

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.120
being a strong woman?

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.280
What's the logic?

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.720
Seriously no go?

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.320
With all these,

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.960
I'm stuck with either having kids

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960
or husband-bashing.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.240
That's it?

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.280
You can consider one of these two.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.680
Man...

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.840
both are challenging.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.120
Got your point.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.160
Let me sleep on it.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.040
Think it through.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.680
Yeah, I will.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.640
I'll do my utmost

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.840
to make you

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.120
our next top star.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.040
Cool, I'll do my best.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.200
OK.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.520
Can I get

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.920
a copy of that?

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.120
Everything's ready for you.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.120
Boss,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.960
true captain material!

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.880
I'll text you later.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.600
Alright!

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.840
OK.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.520
Fu Yudong!

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:39.960
At tomorrow's meeting,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.200
discuss item three

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.200
with Lady Wan.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.080
[Legal's concerns]

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.960
[seem valid.]

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.440
[Lady Wan's]

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.240
[signing the contract]

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.360
[with us tomorrow.]

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.600
[Li Daoqi and I...]

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.520
Something came up.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.520
Holler at you later.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.560
[Ready for bed, handsome?]

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.360
Taking tomorrow off.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.360
Where to?

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.960
Need protection

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.120
for what we're about to do!

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.040
No protection needed,

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.240
get to it!

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.960
But you said

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.880
safe periods aren't safe.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.920
Who cares,

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.120
c'mon!

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.280
But your career's...

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.320
just taking off.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.200
If you get pregnant...

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.280
won't that ruin it?

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.560
You'll blame me later.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.360
Pregnancy is fine.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.080
Lin Chang told me

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.080
if I get pregnant,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.880
I'll pivot to Baby & Maternity.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.440
There's more money there.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.400
Help me make this happen!

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.480
What's up?

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.800
What's wrong?

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.560
Just using me

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.400
as a tool, huh?

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.560
I told you before,

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.600
don't wanna be your content

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.040
or your tool.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.840
Like you

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.240
don't use me for content?

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.520
AIN'T YOU MR. PERFECT HUSBAND?

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.600
Hey, Doctor Fu,

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.800
do I have sensitive skin?

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.720
Ever made

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.840
any products for me?

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.680
I didn't go for

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.040
the angry wife,

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.440
that's me

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.840
being nice.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.520
You in or not?

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.280
Hey, hey,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.000
hey!

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.440
Kitchen's

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.200
my bed tonight.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.480
I won't make more tools.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.280
More?

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.560
Someone's being cocky!

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.080
[Li Daoqi, continue!]

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.320
I'm right here!

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.080
Come when you're ready,

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:56.960
tiger.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.240
[All good now,]

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.080
[continue.]

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.040
Ungrateful

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:05.840
bastard.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.160
[Yeah, tomorrow.]

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:07.960
[Just tell her]

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.040
[at the meeting.]

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.200
Those vases are nice.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.640
Can I grab those too?

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.240
Sorry sir,

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.320
not for sale.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.800
Ah, too bad.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.640
Um, sir,

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.120
this card was declined.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.760
Could you...

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.760
Probably

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.040
the phone messed it up.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:46.840
It's good.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.440
Alright.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.360
Here.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.720
One moment please.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.440
No hurry.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.480
Skip the receipt.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.320
OK.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:56.920
Alright.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.760
Take care!

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.040
Thanks, you too!

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.440
Grand opening!

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.840
Money flowing!

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.640
Please.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.720
Welcome!

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.840
Got a meeting,

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.680
gotta run.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.320
Get going then.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.160
Xinying!

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.720
Hey!

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.160
I love the malatang.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.520
Hope your business rocks!

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.640
Thanks!

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.720
Got a meeting, gotta go,

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.760
I've already

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.080
paid up.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.680
C'mon, stick around a bit?

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.880
I'll swing by again soon!

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.480
He's busy.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.360
Yeah, my jacket...

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.640
Yeah, take it.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.520
Almost forgot.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.840
[Here's your order.]

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.000
[Just ask if you need anything.]

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:17.760
Xinying,

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560
take a breather with us.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.200
How's it? Good?

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.160
Yummy!

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:25.720
Got

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.360
special sauce recipe.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.000
Did you create

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.960
this sauce yourself?

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.520
She did it.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.520
We thought it was

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.960
a secret recipe passed down!

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.960
It's incredible!

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.320
You're funny.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.000
Enjoy!

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.640
Did you

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.000
work in restaurants before,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.760
or

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040
study cooking?

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.360
She studied finance overseas.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.000
My cousin here

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.720
always wanted

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.840
to make malatang.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.120
Living the dream now, huh?

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:54.840
It's good.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.120
Back when I was overseas,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.840
auntie,

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.880
I was dying for malatang.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.640
Couldn't find any good ones.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.880
When I was little,

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.400
I only ate the plain ones,

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.600
no kick to it.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.240
Then abroad,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.840
I went crazy with the spices,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
like my way of

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.560
dealing with homesickness.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.920
Hey, the gift?

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.240
I'll grab it.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.360
Balcony.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.960
Seriously, you...

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.280
Hold on.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.760
Your mom shipped this

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.000
to us.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.640
She couldn't make it back.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.080
It's for you!

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.440
From Mom?

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.240
What is it?

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.800
Take a look!

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.600
What is it?

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.760
A kitty!

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.320
Lucky cat!

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.160
To great business!

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.320
Ailing is thoughtful.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.040
Yeah.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.680
A fitting gift.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.320
Adorable.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.080
Mom's really looking out for me.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.480
Of course, she is,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.520
silly!

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.640
What's up with

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.400
the flowers?

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.640
For you.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.040
Thanks.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.600
Nian,

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.720
full yet?

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.080
Yep.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.400
Go play, kiddo.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.000
Go!

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.640
Why flowers?

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.760
Just saw them at the shop.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.280
Looked pretty,

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:43.960
so I grabbed them.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.560
Didn't expect

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.320
you back so early.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.120
Want some noodles?

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.000
Nah, sit down.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.080
sit, sit.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.760
Listen, hon,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.720
I've been doing some thinking.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.440
About that

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.160
school thing for Nian,

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.680
should've

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120
talked to you first.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.400
My bad, really.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.000
I must apologize.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.040
It's OK,

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.840
you did it for him.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:15.480
Though

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.800
that school wasn't really...

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.840
Yeah,

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.840
water under the bridge now.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.040
From here on out,

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:23.040
anything

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.840
about Nian,

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.159
you call the shots.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.480
Whatever you say goes!

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.239
Thanks.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.080
That's that.

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:37.639
Moving on.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.199
Sure.

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.320
Hey, got some good news.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.600
What's up?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.520
I scored a deal

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.639
with Lady Wan

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:44.719
for the holiday.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.000
She's gonna livestream for us.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.520
No way!

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.280
Cool, huh?

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.280
Awesome! Congrats!

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.080
But here's the thing,

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.000
her sales numbers

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.080
are crazy high.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.480
Our inventory

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.640
can't keep up,

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.240
plus all these platform fees

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:02.920
and stuff.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.480
It's putting us

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.400
in a tight spot.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.480
Our cash flow's

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480
tight,

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.400
so maybe

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.360
we'll have to...

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.520
Better get

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.840
your team on that.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.880
Just talked about it at the meeting.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.000
Everyone's supposed to

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.080
come up with ideas.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.640
Been thinking about it

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.400
on the way,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.920
trying to figure something out...

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:29.720
Well,

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.480
no more work talk

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.680
at home.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.240
Sure.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:36.600
Yeah.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.360
Curry rice,

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:39.880
nice.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.480
Yeah,

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.520
that insurance

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.760
you got,

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.800
how many years was it for?

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.720
50 years.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.880
50 years?

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.240
Thought it was like 200 years.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:54.960
You're really...

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.920
planning ahead...

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.320
Look, Daoqi.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.200
Starting from scratch

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.240
and getting

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.960
your company to

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.960
partner with

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.520
big league influencers,

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.560
that's amazing.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.720
Proud of you!

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.360
As your wife,

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.040
I'll absolutely help

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.280
when you're

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.080
truly stuck.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.560
I'm your

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.520
last line of defense.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.400
But you can't just

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.280
run to me

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.480
whenever things

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.640
get tough.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.720
How will you ever learn to

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.040
run a business that way?

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:35.920
That's not gonna work.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.560
Hey, I didn't always

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.720
run to you...

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.320
Nah, you didn't.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.360
Never said you did.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.160
You thought

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:44.960
I was trying to tap into our funds

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.000
for the business?

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:46.760
No way!

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.240
You'd never do that!

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.320
How could I?

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.640
I'd never.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.000
Exactly, you wouldn't.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.920
Must be your imagination.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.920
Oh, silly me.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.760
Way off base.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.520
Totally wouldn't.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.040
Right, my bad.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.800
Right.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.600
Want those noodles?

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.640
Y...yeah.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.560
The instant kind?

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.280
Those ones.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.800
Egg on top?

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.560
Over hard.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.280
Two dogs?

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:04.920
Yup.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.120
On it.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:06.520
Cool.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.360
Okey dokey.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.320
That insurance stuff,

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.360
just wanted

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.760
some financial tips, y'know?

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:15.800
Fine,

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.080
I'll give you

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.120
some financial tips later.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.760
I'm not trying to

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.160
be difficult here,

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.920
but business-wise,

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.360
this plan

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.120
just

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.440
doesn't work.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.240
Let's be real,

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.120
getting on

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.080
these big influencers' shows

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.440
is just burning money for exposure.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.600
Who's gonna

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.160
cover the inventory deposits

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.760
and handle

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.600
all the

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.600
returns?

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.840
And she wants

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.280
the lowest price,

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.240
that totally wrecks

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.600
our pricing.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.840
Let me be straight,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
I'm not on board.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.600
We're a new brand.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.360
Being new is exactly

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.240
why we need

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.600
this chance,

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.520
right?

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.760
What did Mr. Xing

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.640
teach us?

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.080
In this game,

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.880
nothing matters more than:

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.600
BRAND, BRAND, BRAND!

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.120
And what makes a brand?

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.040
Marketing, man!

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.480
Lady Wan's 11.11 live

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.800
is like prime-time

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.400
national TV ads in the 90s!

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.360
How can we just

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.680
pass this up?

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.680
Here's the deal:

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.720
either we follow Mr. Li,

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.320
or we split.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.600
Everyone's got a point.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.080
Business

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.960
is risky, sure,

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.280
but we gotta

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.400
manage those risks.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.720
This company's

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.480
a joint venture between us.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.440
Since you boys

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.600
are

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.000
pumped

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.720
about this event.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.200
I'll put in more cash.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.560
But you'll

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.480
have to step up

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:13.760
with more too.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.640
Yeah,

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.400
sure.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.160
Seriously,

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.720
you looked pretty boss

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.920
back there.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.440
But wasn't it

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.760
too harsh?

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.880
You honestly don't see it?

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:01.800
Those two

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.800
were setting you up.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.200
Not even their first time.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.040
I had to

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.240
make a stand,

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.360
had to force their hand!

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.320
Feels like my hand

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.520
got forced.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.720
Was shaking my head,

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.800
didn't you see?

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.080
Thought you meant "don't chicken out."

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.800
Wanted you to stay quiet.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.960
In that situation,

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.200
silence would be the best move!

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.040
Yeah yeah, got it.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.320
No sweat.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
So what now?

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.440
We'll find a way.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.440
You were hotter than him back there.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.720
Who's that?

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.520
Roberto Baggio.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.560
Don't you know him?
