00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.110
Today?

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:19.770
Not today.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:21.730
I'm too tired to walk.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.420
Tomorrow.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.100
Tomorrow?

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.540
At night?

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.250
Not at night.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.970
Tomorrow at the Shen hour.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:33.970
Shen hour?

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.370
Very well.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.830
I'll have it done then.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.010
My thanks.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.510
Think nothing of it.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.940
Let's go.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.300
Huai'an,

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.490
there was something odd

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.540
about that man.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.130
How so?

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.240
He almost

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.850
seemed

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.100
afraid of you.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.460
You're overthinking things.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.980
Come with me to a clinic.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.120
If we could return to Taiyiji,

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.930
we wouldn't need to go to another clinic.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.210
Can a clinic in a place like this

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.220
really be trusted?

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.300
Yes.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.160
Your senior brother's life was saved there.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:27.750
Really?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.500
Yi Zhihu.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.260
Yi Zhihu is real?

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.650
How did you meet this physician?

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.850
I've been hunted for years.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.780
One winter, Yi crossed paths with me

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.130
and saved me.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.900
Yi said obsession

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.100
as deep as mine had never been seen

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.850
and wished to see how my story would end.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.650
Yi Zhihu,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.780
you're a woman?

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.690
I thought Yi would be some ugly old man.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.740
Rumor says

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.210
that a northern healer, hideous of face,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.820
can bring the dying back to life

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.890
and wed a young bride at 50.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.540
But in truth, Yi Zhihu

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.500
is a woman.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.300
The ugly one

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:17.980
is her helper.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.850
Those who come to me

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.500
have all been to the verge of death.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.450
Without a few tricks,

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.410
I couldn't have survived.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.820
Treating your senior brother last time, for example,

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.220
drew the Huben guards upon me.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.410
Aren't you going to step out?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.410
Why should I?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.920
I need to examine his wounds.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.520
There's no need to keep things from Xiaoqing.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.770
There's nothing

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.370
she can't know.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.220
Is that so?

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.840
Seems to me you're still hiding something from her.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.820
Where is he?

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.060
The King of Tiemo is in the city now.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.260
Is your blade ready?

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.850
With the enemy at the gates,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.540
killing him alone won't be enough.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.980
I've devised a plan

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.580
to kill every Tiemo invader.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.460
Do you have enough forces?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.810
Of course.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.880
- General. - General.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.760
- General. - General.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:33.900
Where are the others?

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.420
Have my orders

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.500
lost all weight in this camp?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.900
General,

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.260
the other officers

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.130
are gone.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.130
What did you say?

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.600
The other officers

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.610
and their men

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.850
have vanished.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.220
Have they deserted?

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.500
Then track them down!

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.450
General,

00:20:53.451 --> 00:21:13.725
(Watch on www.dramacool.club to support Admin)

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.130
it's been nearly five days.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.370
We have

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:57.810
no trail to follow.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.130
Xiang Xuehuai!

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:14.550
Please.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.310
How are you

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.420
still drinking tea?

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.500
Look,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.410
he caught us.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.560
This is Mr. Xie Huai'an's friend,

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.110
Ye Zheng.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.980
He's brought Mr. Xie's command.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.370
Whatever the order is,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.410
we have a greater internal crisis.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.060
Do you realize

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.850
what is happening?

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:37.440
Six entire units have disappeared!

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.450
I know that.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.950
That was due to Mr. Xie's first order.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.550
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.940
Calm yourself.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.000
I knew your temper,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.070
so I held back.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.270
The messenger that day

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.120
was from the Huben Army.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.210
This letter is from Xie Huai'an.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.450
If we follow his strategy,

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.100
we may

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.560
have a chance to defeat the Tiemo people.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.360
Farewell.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.310
Wait.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.690
Why are you helping us?

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.580
You are soldiers.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.930
So are we.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.470
That's why Xie Huai'an

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.650
trusts me.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.340
Where will you go next?

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.650
The four regional commanders hold massive forces.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.300
I will carry Xie Huai'an's order

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.780
to each of them.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440
Five days ago,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.860
Mr. Xie Huai'an secretly ordered me

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.540
to send out

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:51.980
our finest troops.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.930
Where were they sent?

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.650
They're all in Chang'an.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.060
When do we strike,

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.890
and what is the signal?

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.500
Tomorrow

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.650
at the Shen hour.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.260
The wind will rise.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.100
Where have you been?

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.740
Zheng, how thoughtful you are.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.930
You look grumpy,

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.610
but the congee you made smells wonderful.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.580
Thank you.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.500
You and that mouth of yours.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:06.450
Come in.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.580
The food's ready.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.820
Tiemo shadow guards won't risk alerting us.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.360
If they're walking openly with axes,

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.210
they're likely just ordinary neighbors.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.980
Come on.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.930
Cen Pickles!

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.820
Is Cen Pickles not home?

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:45.820
Why are you here?

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.100
For a meal!

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.930
You've run out of grain already?

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.100
We're saving it.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.130
Once war starts,

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.610
supplies may be cut off at any moment.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.740
We eat his grain first,

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.610
then ours. Come on.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.610
Shameless.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.410
You "flatter" us.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:43.590
Your Majesty.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.040
Have you found Xie Huai'an?

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.370
Not yet.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.610
We're sending more men to search.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.520
He's Liu Ziwen's son.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.740
Everything

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.890
the Huben Army learned, he learned.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.210
Finding him

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.850
won't be easy.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.580
There is another matter

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.500
Your Majesty may want to hear.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.000
Speak.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.200
Sha from the wonton stall

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.680
treated Xiao Wenjing

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.610
to a bowl of rice.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.710
Rice?

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:17.600
Yes.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.210
He used the chance

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.020
to see how many of us

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.650
were tailing Xiao Wenjing.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.260
They may

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:33.960
act soon.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.150
Then we've likely

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.060
found Xie Huai'an.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.670
And Cen Weizong.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:07.620
Thank you.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.870
All right, that's enough.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.070
Full?

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.140
Yes.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.890
Good. We're leaving!

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.320
- We'll take the clay pot tomorrow. - We're leaving.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.440
Carry the ax for me.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:15.490
We're leaving.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.410
I'll come back tomorrow.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.580
- We're leaving, sir. - Be careful.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.690
Come on.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.450
Your neighbors in Ronghua Alley

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.100
are treating your home like it's a granary.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:33.060
Those few you saw,

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.540
plus the ones who didn't come today,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.740
come here to eat

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.890
whenever they like.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.810
I gave them nicknames:

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.370
Gulouzi,

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.500
Gourd Chicken,

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.740
Noodle Soup,

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:47.890
and Boiled Lamb.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.740
Food is the primary need of the people.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.700
When grain runs out,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.810
their world collapses.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.200
Sha told me

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.890
that in the old days,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.980
the founding emperor, you, my father,

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.850
and Wu Zhongheng

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.500
often gathered in that little shop

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.780
for a bowl of wontons.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.680
Sha worked all night

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.780
and barely earned a few coins.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.020
So he complained?

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.540
But he's right.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.650
It's been nearly 20 years.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.690
Among the few of us, I'm the one

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.780
who achieved the least.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:33.840
But I enjoyed

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.090
being with my friends.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.780
Wu Zhongheng

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.060
is now the King of Tiemo.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.690
Are you still friends?

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.260
Most likely not.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.890
After your father

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.260
hung the red silk on the hemlock tree,

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.220
I never showed up again.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.920
Wu Zhongheng must have known then

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.890
that I belonged to the Liu faction.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.650
If we were still friends,

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.650
I could have walked into his courtyard

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:39.460
to assassinate him,

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.070
regardless of the outcome.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.330
The Grand Preceptor cannot die.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.260
As for killing him,

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:53.830
I already have a plan.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.600
Are you hungry?

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.020
Want some congee?

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.780
Here.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.410
No, thanks.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:39.080
You go on and eat.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.090
I'm not hungry.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.260
Then why the long face?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.260
I feel uneasy.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.900
It's freezing out there,

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.130
yet he sits alone like that.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.530
He'll catch a cold.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.040
- I'll call him back. - Don't.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:12.770
We'd better

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.170
let him be.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.820
[You hour]

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.480
Open the door.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.290
Yes, sir.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.310
My men have been negligent.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.500
You are, after all, about to be emperor.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.260
How could they serve you a meal like this?

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.460
The empire is collapsing.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.670
What emperor?

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.180
It's only a show,

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.170
with me playing the monkey

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:42.420
for the Tiemo people.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.130
This is the peace treaty I drafted.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.770
Accept it,

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.460
and you can save your nation,

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.750
Your Majesty.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.000
[Firstly, the two nations shall be as brothers.]

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.400
[Secondly, the three prefectures north of North Office are ceded to Tiemo.]

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.950
"All land north of North Office

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.090
belongs to Tiemo"?

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.940
"Annual tribute: 250,000 liang of gold,

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.020
250,000 liang of silver,

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.420
100,000 horses,

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.940
300,000 bolts of silk,

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.660
[900,000 dan of grain]

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.900
and 900,000 dan of grain"?

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.290
Even the fertile fields of Ganzhou

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.770
yield only 200,000 dan a year.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.500
Huzhou, Huai'an, and the others

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.240
yield less than 100,000 dan a year.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.170
Yet you demand 900,000 in tribute?

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.500
You call this a peace treaty?

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:28.940
Isn't this

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.010
just turning my people

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.920
into your slaves

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.230
and livestock?

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.570
Past Xigu Mountain City,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.500
Chang'an has no natural defenses left.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.380
My main forces

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.820
are just 300 li away.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.290
When they arrive,

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.170
the well-off people of Chang'an

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.980
won't just be slaves or livestock.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.820
Even the chance to stay alive

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.940
won't belong to everyone.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.380
Tomorrow,

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.210
tear off that mask of yours,

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.060
show yourself as the Emperor of Chang'an,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.640
and sit on your throne.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.850
We will seal this treaty by exchanging

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.630
letters of credence.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:32.860
In return,

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.800
your people will live.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.730
I was once a useless emperor,

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.340
blind to the sufferings of the people.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.570
But now I understand.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.340
A bowl of rice

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.650
or a single flatbread

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.820
can be the line between life and death.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.500
If you can't even give them that,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.330
then attack.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.420
When you do, the people of Chang'an

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.770
will die fighting with you.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.540
You can try.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.170
If you lose,

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.020
Chang'an will be a wasteland.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.020
Monster.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.340
But so am I.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.730
Huai'an.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.980
Why are you sharpening my blade?

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:03.760
Here.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.390
It's done.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:17.880
Huai'an,

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.450
you're acting strangely today.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.570
Are you hiding something from me?

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:24.650
No.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.230
You're the one hiding something.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.140
The pageboy is locked in the Imperial Guard Station.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:37.610
You scouted out the place, right?

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.020
So?

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.820
Did you find a way to rescue him?

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.900
You knew?

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.720
We're friends.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.390
How could I not know what you're thinking?

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.060
I'm not confident.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.440
There are too many guards.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.460
It's hard to break in.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.560
Once the Shen-hour plan begins,

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:00.340
the Tiemo people will kill him the moment

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:01.210
they feel threatened.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.340
He won't die.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.980
Give me a battalion.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.130
I will take

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.730
the station within two hours.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.380
If you storm it, he may truly die.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.090
Ye Zheng,

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.250
the Shen-hour plan

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.610
cannot afford

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.900
a single misstep.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:23.540
Therefore,

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.840
you must appear at the exact place

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.090
I designated for you

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.820
and wait for me there.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.420
I will

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.290
rescue the pageboy.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.730
How?

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:42.010
Yesterday,

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.500
I had Sha serve him a bowl of rice.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.380
I let the Tiemo people see it on purpose

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:48.610
so they'd believe

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.820
I intended to rescue him.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.170
That means today,

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.820
the pageboy will be

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.020
forced to exchange letters of credence with Tiemo

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.020
as the Emperor of Chang'an,

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.540
and

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:04.210
the best moment to act is when he is

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.610
on his way to the palace.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:10.290
But

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:12.650
why expose such a flaw?

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.860
It's the only

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.500
and the most convincing way.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.570
Only by doing so

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.380
can the Shen-hour plan

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.940
remain concealed.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:23.650
No.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.640
Absolutely not.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.420
You will expose yourself.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:27.820
You will be risking your life!

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:30.860
It is a life for a life.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.500
Ye Zheng,

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.900
if you were the one in danger,

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.020
I would do the same.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.210
But...

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:42.090
Enough.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.940
No more arguing.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.540
If we do manage to drive out the Tiemo people,

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:47.730
don't forget

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.730
to reunite with Zhaolu.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.230
I will.

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.270
When all this ends,

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:56.340
I will find her.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.430
But until then,

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.250
I must keep you safe.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.770
If anything happens to you,

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.090
what meaning will my life have left?

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.500
I know

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.500
that once you decide something,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.940
no one can sway you.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.340
Since following you,

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.210
I've never questioned your decisions

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:26.540
or faltered

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:28.460
in carrying out your orders.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.020
But this is different.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.860
You're walking straight to your death.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.940
Huai'an,

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:38.900
sometimes you should put yourself first.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.940
Huai'an,

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.170
your hair...

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:05.020
I was born white-haired,

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.220
and I'll die white-haired.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:11.030
What is there to fear?

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:23.900
All right,

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.820
time for me to go.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.900
At the Shen hour,

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:29.630
we'll meet again.
