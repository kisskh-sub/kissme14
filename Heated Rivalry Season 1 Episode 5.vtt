00:01.042 --> 00:02.627
<i>Previously on</i>
Heated Rivalry...

00:02.752 --> 00:04.421
So, Lily's just a buddy?

00:04.587 --> 00:05.922
- What?
- Yo, chill out, man.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.549
I know you text
some girl named Lily.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.883
I don't.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.511
<i>Are you seeing
anyone these days?</i>

00:12.554 --> 00:13.596
Nope.

00:15.890 --> 00:19.185
- I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- Hollander...

00:19.310 --> 00:21.813
- Well, you just seem tense.
- I'm fine.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.356
<i>Shut up.
You're in love with him.</i>

00:23.481 --> 00:25.900
I'm not in love with him.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.361
- <i>You are.</i>
- Fuck!

00:28.486 --> 00:30.405
- Roz, you gotta see this.
- No!

00:30.530 --> 00:32.615
Dude, she's, like,
a huge fucking movie star.

00:32.782 --> 00:33.742
I'm Rose, by the way.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.786
<i>They are definitely
one hot couple.</i>

00:36.953 --> 00:38.455
<i>They are fire.</i>

01:07.734 --> 01:09.027
Hey.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.113
Hey. I have to get back
to my hotel for my pickup.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.656
Right.

01:15.408 --> 01:18.745
Listen, uh,
about last night, I...

01:18.870 --> 01:20.497
It's fine.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.665
I think this season
is stressing me out

01:22.791 --> 01:23.666
more than usual.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.086
Yeah. Let's do dinner
this week.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.670
Maybe just the two of us?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.172
Yeah, for sure.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.343
Bye.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.620
Top of the morning!

02:00.745 --> 02:02.497
You, uh...

02:02.622 --> 02:04.833
You get any sleep
last night, huh?

02:06.876 --> 02:08.878
You're a fucking beautician.
Let's go.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.881
<i>All right, welcome back
to</i> Man in the Crease,

02:12.006 --> 02:13.550
<i>your one-stop hockey shop.</i>

02:13.716 --> 02:15.635
<i>And to the upcoming
All-Star Game in Tampa Bay...</i>

02:15.760 --> 02:17.720
<i>Major League Hockey fans
are finally getting</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:19.472
<i>what they've been
asking for for years:</i>

02:19.597 --> 02:20.932
<i>East versus West.</i>

02:21.057 --> 02:22.392
<i>Which means a chance
for something</i>

02:22.559 --> 02:24.185
<i>we've never seen before:</i>

02:24.310 --> 02:27.230
<i>Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov
playing on the same team,</i>

02:27.355 --> 02:28.565
<i>maybe even the same line.</i>

02:28.690 --> 02:30.400
<i>Who's centering who in Florida?</i>

02:30.525 --> 02:32.318
<i>And where does Scott Hunter
fit into the mix?</i>

02:32.443 --> 02:34.070
<i>And speaking of Scott Hunter,</i>

02:34.195 --> 02:36.114
<i>will the New York captain
keep up his red-hot pace,</i>

02:36.239 --> 02:37.240
<i>or will he...</i>

02:37.407 --> 02:38.992
<i>How do we put this kindly?</i>

02:39.117 --> 02:41.494
<i>Crash and burn, like he does
halfway through every season?</i>

02:41.619 --> 02:43.705
<i>Not sure that's very kind,
but it was succinct.</i>

02:59.304 --> 03:01.764
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.144
You're so cute.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.730
Have I told you
how cute you are?

03:08.855 --> 03:11.149
No. I mean, maybe.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.942
Well, you are.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.944
Miles is extremely jealous.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.154
Of me?

03:16.279 --> 03:18.364
No, of me.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.950
Oh! Oh.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.788
Did you not notice
that Miles is gay?

03:27.165 --> 03:30.168
I guess I hadn't really
thought about it, so...

03:30.293 --> 03:31.502
Well, he is.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.671
And he's low-key
in love with you.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.715
Oh.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.219
Does it surprise you
that Miles is gay?

03:39.344 --> 03:41.930
No. I mean,
of course not, no.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.348
Well, a lot of actors are.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.974
They're just not all out.

03:47.644 --> 03:52.899
Are there any, like,
gay hockey players?

03:53.024 --> 03:54.776
I mean, yes.

03:54.901 --> 03:59.948
Obviously, there are, but are
there any openly gay players?

04:01.032 --> 04:02.575
Yeah, uh, no.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.955
I mean, yeah, there are probably
gay players or whatever,

04:07.080 --> 04:12.752
but none that have
said it publicly.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.256
Huh.

04:17.131 --> 04:18.341
What?

04:20.176 --> 04:23.763
Sorry, I don't think I'm
going about this the right way.

04:23.888 --> 04:24.931
Um...

04:25.056 --> 04:26.766
Going about what?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.982
I really like you, Shane.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.441
I like you too.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.778
But I have a feeling that...

04:40.196 --> 04:42.991
maybe I'm not doing it for you?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.242
Yes, you are.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.327
- I know you like talking to me.
- Yeah.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.538
- Do you like kissing me?
- Sure.

04:50.790 --> 04:51.791
Wow.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.419
No. No, no,
of course I do. Sorry.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.796
No, hey, don't apologize.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.381
I just...

04:59.257 --> 05:00.550
I have a feeling.

05:00.675 --> 05:04.178
And--and maybe I'm completely
off base here,

05:04.304 --> 05:08.349
but I don't know, I feel like
maybe you'd rather be kissing...

05:08.474 --> 05:10.893
Miles?

05:15.523 --> 05:18.109
Hey it's--it's really OK.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.652
It's not.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.366
I do like you. I really do.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.952
I like talking with you.
I like being with you.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.704
I like all of it.

05:31.122 --> 05:35.543
I know the sex stuff
is a problem, but...

05:35.668 --> 05:37.295
It's not a problem.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.756
A problem is
something you can fix.

05:39.922 --> 05:44.719
We're more like
a square peg in a round hole.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.179
Ew.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.680
No. I'm sorry.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.599
Forget I said that. Um...

05:50.516 --> 05:51.601
We're just...

05:51.768 --> 05:53.603
We're not meant to fit.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.104
And it's really fine.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.983
I just don't think
that we can keep trying.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.781
I get it. I--I just, uh...

06:05.948 --> 06:07.909
I think, um...

06:11.079 --> 06:13.039
I think, uh...

06:14.040 --> 06:16.584
Hey, you don't owe me
any explanation.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.629
- I feel like I kind of do.
- You really don't.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.888
Can I ask if you've ever
been with another guy?

06:38.731 --> 06:41.984
Have you ever told
anyone that before?

06:45.196 --> 06:48.157
Was it different with a guy?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.996
Of course.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.706
Was it better?

07:01.087 --> 07:03.381
Yeah, it was, uh...

07:03.506 --> 07:05.091
Um...

07:05.216 --> 07:06.717
It was better.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.763
The thing is, I...

07:13.349 --> 07:16.102
I kind of prefer being the hole
rather than the peg.

07:18.020 --> 07:18.771
Wow!

07:18.896 --> 07:20.273
That is the best thing

07:20.398 --> 07:23.693
any gay boyfriend of mine
has ever told me.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.862
Oh, you've had other...

07:25.987 --> 07:27.697
Oh, I was in theater school.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.324
Like, 70% of my boyfriends
have left me for other guys.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.368
- 70%?
- Actually, 80%.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.745
Yeah.

07:34.871 --> 07:35.872
Wow.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.877
You should follow Miles
back on Instagram.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.044
No.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.839
I mean, not "no,"

07:44.964 --> 07:48.634
but I just need to sort
some things out first.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.052
Of course.

07:51.387 --> 07:56.142
And I was kidding about Miles,
but he totally would.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.727
Like, in a heartbeat.

08:01.314 --> 08:05.318
You haven't said anything
to him, have you?

08:05.443 --> 08:06.527
No, definitely not.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.738
And I never will.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.082
Let's be friends.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.919
- Yeah.
- No, seriously.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.630
Not some bullshit,
"Let's stay friends," thing.

08:25.755 --> 08:29.717
Let's be real friends.
Like, best friends.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.511
OK.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.970
I really like you, Shane.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.890
You're secretly one of
the funniest guys I know.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.309
Well, that secret,
you don't have to keep.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.936
Oh, I will tell everyone.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.024
I have a feeling that
there's not a lot of people

08:45.149 --> 08:46.275
you can talk to.

08:46.442 --> 08:50.071
I mean about all
the other things and stuff.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.074
Things and stuff
can be tricky for me.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.039
Text me whenever, OK?

09:00.164 --> 09:03.209
I mean it, because I will be
texting you all the time.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.460
Promise.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.045
You will wish
you never met me.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.171
Impossible.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.192
Matheson on the power play
while Petrov warms the bench.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.027
Jesus Christ.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.738
Since when do you care
what Colorado does?

09:32.863 --> 09:35.324
Since when did you
start smoking again?

09:37.118 --> 09:38.619
I haven't started again.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.496
Just every once in a while.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.834
I care about all hockey teams
as you well know.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.836
Of course.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.170
Especially ones that
put good Russian players

09:48.337 --> 09:50.089
on the second shift
of the power play

09:50.214 --> 09:52.592
so mediocre Canadian players
can waste a minute and a half

09:52.717 --> 09:53.843
with the man advantage.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.845
Mediocre? Matheson?

09:55.970 --> 09:58.889
Yes. You can quote me.

09:59.807 --> 10:02.101
When I see him
at the all-star game.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.354
So embarrassing
that he's playing.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.317
The people voted.
They love him.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.694
The people are wrong.

10:13.487 --> 10:17.033
You're playing on the same team
as Hollander this year, right?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.619
Is he also mediocre?

10:19.744 --> 10:23.581
No, he's amazing. Those hands.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.374
And he's gorgeous.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.376
If you say so.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.424
What?

10:33.549 --> 10:37.053
You know he's gorgeous.
And you know he's good.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.722
He's very good.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.226
I would love to see you
on a line with him.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.063
Not sure he can play wing.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.397
But you can.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.278
You would have him center me?

10:55.738 --> 10:56.864
Me?

10:56.989 --> 10:59.367
The people would love it.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.202
The people are wrong!

11:03.371 --> 11:06.374
The people are wrong!

11:10.252 --> 11:11.754
Ah!

11:12.672 --> 11:15.383
I wonder how many outfits
Rose Landry will bring.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.927
She has such good style.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.293
Can I offer you
something to drink?

11:51.460 --> 11:53.796
I'll have the same
as my teammate, please.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.214
Of course.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.806
So, what, are they out
of ginger ale, Captain?

12:03.931 --> 12:05.891
I'm feeling a bit wild.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.019
So this should be fun, huh?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.397
I've always wondered
what it would be like

12:11.522 --> 12:13.149
to play on the same team.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.358
Have you?

12:14.483 --> 12:17.027
Yeah, I have.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.573
Nice that it's in Florida
this year, right?

12:20.698 --> 12:21.782
Yes.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.492
Here you go.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.785
Thanks.

12:29.915 --> 12:33.002
Did, uh, did you
bring anyone with you?

12:33.961 --> 12:35.504
Uh, my parents
thought about coming,

12:35.671 --> 12:38.007
but they're going to Mexico
in, like, two weeks,

12:38.174 --> 12:40.134
and they've been
to these before, so...

12:41.302 --> 12:42.344
Ah.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.348
Also, I didn't feel like
being managed this weekend.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.936
Did you, uh, bring anybody?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.273
Nope.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.703
Nice shirt.

13:07.828 --> 13:11.999
Thanks. I like to, you know,
get into the spirit.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.418
You're pulling it off.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.836
Cats and dogs!

13:15.961 --> 13:17.546
Look at this!
Fucking beauties!

13:17.671 --> 13:19.048
Yeah, should be a fun time.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.883
Careful with this guy, though.

13:21.050 --> 13:21.967
You can never trust him.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.219
One black coffee, please.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.595
I'm just fucking
with you, Rozy.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.763
It'll be a hell of a time.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.431
Let's go, East boys! Woo-hoo!

13:33.896 --> 13:35.231
I feel like we're gonna

13:35.397 --> 13:37.566
get a lot of that
sort of thing this weekend.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.655
It should give us a chance
to get to know each other.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.242
Who knows what we
might have in common.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.873
You're looking
very pretty today.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.083
Hmm?

13:54.208 --> 13:55.835
Different, maybe?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.212
Someone take you shopping?

14:02.424 --> 14:04.093
If I, um...

14:05.219 --> 14:06.720
If I tell you something,

14:06.846 --> 14:09.473
will you promise not to tell
anyone or make fun of me?

14:10.599 --> 14:11.642
Well, it depends.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.269
Seriously.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.898
Yeah, sure.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.193
I hired a stylist.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.617
Fuck you.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.120
Sorry.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.123
Wow. Of course you did.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.875
I shouldn't have told you.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.127
No, no.
I love it. I love it.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.629
You got, what,
tired of looking like shit?

14:40.754 --> 14:41.922
I didn't look like shit.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.632
I just wore,
like, athletic stuff.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.135
Mmm. I know what you wore.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.722
And some of the guys in
the league are so fashionable.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.723
Yeah, so very.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.099
Not you.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.309
Some of the guys.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.268
In the league?

14:54.393 --> 14:55.811
Other players, not you.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.313
OK.

15:04.153 --> 15:09.033
So, this has nothing to do
with Rose Landry?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.327
No.

15:11.493 --> 15:15.831
Well, I mean, yeah, she always
dressed, um, very well,

15:15.956 --> 15:17.291
and so do her friends, but...

15:17.416 --> 15:18.918
I just wanted to stop looking

15:19.043 --> 15:20.502
like I was always
going to the gym.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.005
I never really
cared about clothes.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.010
So, uh, you and her are not...

15:28.135 --> 15:29.511
We're not.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.640
She's great, but, uh...

15:32.765 --> 15:34.350
We're just not...

15:35.267 --> 15:38.312
compatible, I guess.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.482
Hmm.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.616
I should circulate, I guess.

15:50.741 --> 15:51.909
Yeah.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.203
You have new clothes
to show off.

16:10.177 --> 16:13.681
OK, and I will not
be losing this time.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.307
But if I lose,

16:15.432 --> 16:19.019
I will buy you all candy bars
from machine inside, OK?

16:19.144 --> 16:20.729
Hey, Hollander!

16:20.854 --> 16:23.732
Hollander, make sure none of
these cheaters cheat, OK?

16:23.857 --> 16:24.858
OK.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.610
- You know that guy?
- Yeah.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.861
Who's this guy?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.321
That's Shane Hollander.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.698
Ah, so you know this guy.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.286
He's the best player
in the league.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.788
Oh, no, no.
That's not true.

16:37.913 --> 16:38.872
Flesher! Boo!

16:38.998 --> 16:40.666
No, you get out of the pool.

16:40.791 --> 16:41.917
No, who is your dad?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.961
Show me your dad.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.754
OK, I forgive you.
You can stay.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.676
<i>On your mark, get set...</i>

16:50.801 --> 16:52.678
Go!

16:55.556 --> 16:59.018
There is a shark
in the water!

16:59.143 --> 17:00.936
There is a shark!

17:17.119 --> 17:18.662
Ah!

17:22.291 --> 17:23.792
Great pass.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.170
Great goal.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.299
OK, you guys won
fair and square.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.928
Hey, Hollander.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.764
Can you give these
kids some money?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.307
I don't have my wallet.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.792
Found you.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.919
So you were looking for me?

18:07.044 --> 18:08.629
Of course not.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.299
Oh, I looked up that word,

18:12.424 --> 18:13.801
uh, "compatible."

18:13.926 --> 18:14.802
What?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.762
Compatible.

18:16.887 --> 18:20.224
I thought I knew what it meant,
but I wanted to be sure.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.392
Oh.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.855
So, you and Rose Landry
are not...

18:26.980 --> 18:30.275
Yeah, not compatible.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.153
Not in that way, anyway.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.788
When do you fly out?

18:43.872 --> 18:45.040
Early.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.501
Same. Columbus.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.128
Toronto.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.892
What room are you in?

19:35.132 --> 19:36.842
This looks serious.

19:36.967 --> 19:37.885
It's not.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.596
I mean, yeah, I guess.

19:40.721 --> 19:44.433
Can you just sit down
or something?

19:54.318 --> 19:58.447
It's not just me, right?

19:58.572 --> 20:00.240
Not just you, what?

20:02.159 --> 20:04.953
You feel it too, don't you?

20:06.413 --> 20:07.873
Feel what?

20:08.957 --> 20:12.878
Last time we were together,
it was different.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.298
What was different?
That you ran away?

20:18.508 --> 20:21.053
Look, I'm--I'm sorry
I freaked out, OK?

20:21.178 --> 20:22.471
Freaked out over nothing.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.056
It wasn't nothing.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.641
Don't act like that.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.976
This is hard enough without
you being an asshole.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.978
What do you want, Hollander?

20:36.026 --> 20:38.153
We get together, we fuck.
It's simple.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.321
Simple?

20:39.488 --> 20:40.739
It's simple for me.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.407
Bullshit!

20:45.160 --> 20:46.620
I think...

20:49.873 --> 20:52.000
I think I'm gay.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.505
Hmm. Oh yeah?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.590
What--what makes you think that?

20:58.715 --> 21:00.342
Fuck you, you're not gay.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.802
No, not completely.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.513
Yeah, well, I think I am.
Completely.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.682
OK, so you're gay, so what?

21:06.807 --> 21:10.852
Well, it's kind of a big deal.
To me, at least.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.897
Sorry if I'm being boring again.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.286
Why are you telling me this?

21:27.411 --> 21:29.413
Who else am I gonna tell?

21:33.583 --> 21:37.879
It's... not just being gay.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.340
It's you.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.051
It's this.

21:44.177 --> 21:45.554
Being gay is one thing,

21:45.679 --> 21:48.974
but this fucking your arch-rival
is another thing.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.351
That's why it is a secret.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.646
I know that, but last time...

21:56.064 --> 21:59.151
And for the record,
I am sorry about last time, OK?

21:59.276 --> 22:01.320
I'm sorry I freaked out.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.866
But before that...

22:07.617 --> 22:09.411
it was nice.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.414
It was.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.543
And it felt like
we were something.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.838
We can't be
something, Hollander.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.762
Would you want to be,
if we could?

22:26.928 --> 22:28.347
We can't.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.058
That's not what I asked.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.435
What does it fucking matter?

22:34.394 --> 22:36.438
I don't think
I can keep pretending

22:36.605 --> 22:37.939
I don't like you anymore.

22:38.106 --> 22:38.982
You don't like me.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.526
Yeah, I do.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.613
I think I like you
maybe a little too much.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.406
Don't. Don't fucking
do this, Hollander.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.866
I'm not...

22:51.119 --> 22:53.455
I wouldn't be able
to go home again.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.873
Ever.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.334
Do you get that?

22:57.459 --> 22:58.460
Because your family?

22:58.627 --> 23:00.128
Because Russia!

23:00.253 --> 23:03.131
I would not be able
to go back to Russia!

23:04.257 --> 23:05.801
What would happen to you?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.804
I don't want to find out.

23:10.263 --> 23:12.474
But would your parents...

23:13.975 --> 23:17.896
My father is police.
My brother is police.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.191
And your mother?

23:21.316 --> 23:22.776
Dead.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.487
I'm sorry.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.406
I was young.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.744
My father is very old fashioned.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.247
And sick.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.582
Sick like crazy?

23:39.126 --> 23:42.003
That too, a little,
but no, sick more like...

23:42.129 --> 23:44.089
Oh, like cancer?

23:44.214 --> 23:46.091
Dementia.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.844
That's awful.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.559
Hey.

23:57.185 --> 23:58.478
Hey...

23:58.603 --> 24:00.188
Sorry.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.678
What?

24:33.138 --> 24:34.639
Nothing.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.851
Good night, Shane.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.897
Good night, Ilya.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.241
Boston Lily's texting you.
Have fun!

24:53.408 --> 24:55.118
- It's not...
- I don't care!

25:45.168 --> 25:46.628
My brother.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.130
You can take it
if you want to.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.757
No, I don't want to.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.010
Is everything OK at home?

25:55.303 --> 25:56.388
Your father?

25:56.513 --> 25:58.098
Enough, OK?

25:58.223 --> 25:59.307
Enough what?

25:59.432 --> 26:01.476
Questions. You have
too many of them.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.144
I'm sorry.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.898
It's OK.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.026
I wasn't clear.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.445
I'm sorry in advance
for tonight's game.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.030
We're gonna destroy you guys.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.534
Oh. So you are the asshole.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.952
No, it's still you.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.454
No, not me.
You are the asshole.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.123
Everyone must know this.

26:23.248 --> 26:27.502
Everyone, Shane Hollander
is an asshole.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.842
OK, listen up.
The rumors are true!

26:34.009 --> 26:37.596
$1,000 for every goal
scored tonight.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.223
OK, boys? Montreal
goes home crying.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.683
Please, please!

26:41.808 --> 26:44.019
You fucking heard him, boys.
Let's go, boys!

26:44.185 --> 26:45.145
Let's do it!

26:45.270 --> 26:46.855
Roll out!

26:49.357 --> 26:50.984
No, no, no, it's not true.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.529
I said you fuckers owe me $1,000
for every goal I score.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.531
You each owe me
3,000 fucking dollars.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.283
Fuck off, Rozy.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.576
You all agreed, huh?

27:04.456 --> 27:06.207
What the fuck do you want?

27:06.374 --> 27:08.168
<i>Hey!</i>

27:09.127 --> 27:11.463
Hey, did you hear
about Rozanov?

27:11.588 --> 27:13.089
What about Rozanov?

27:13.214 --> 27:16.676
Well, he did not fly with the
rest of the team to Nashville.

27:17.594 --> 27:18.803
He flew separately?

27:18.928 --> 27:20.930
He did not go to
Nashville at all.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.058
Well, he didn't get hurt
last night, did he?

27:23.224 --> 27:25.226
- Not that I know of.
- No, he didn't.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.188
Maybe he's sick.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.397
He's not.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.316
I mean, he didn't seem sick.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.859
Who gives a shit?

27:32.984 --> 27:35.236
ESPN is just saying
he did not go to Nashville.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.406
Calm down.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.560
<i>Hi. This is Ilya.</i>

28:07.686 --> 28:10.188
<i>I will never listen
to your voicemail.</i>

28:22.951 --> 28:25.412
Hey. Are you OK?

28:26.538 --> 28:27.789
<i>You wear glasses?</i>

28:27.956 --> 28:29.624
Just for reading.

28:29.749 --> 28:31.042
Where are you?

28:31.167 --> 28:33.837
<i>Home. Put them
back on, please.</i>

28:33.962 --> 28:35.839
Boston?

28:35.964 --> 28:37.298
Moscow.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.051
<i>Oh. Are you OK?</i>

28:40.176 --> 28:43.304
I will be better when I
see you in your glasses again.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.644
Happy?

28:49.811 --> 28:51.312
<i>Happier.</i>

28:52.939 --> 28:54.816
Is your father...

28:55.692 --> 28:57.193
<i>Yes, dead.</i>

28:58.278 --> 28:59.779
Ilya...

29:00.655 --> 29:01.823
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

29:01.990 --> 29:03.658
What are people
saying about me?

29:03.825 --> 29:05.201
<i>Nothing.</i>

29:05.326 --> 29:06.578
<i>Um, the media
is being super secretive,</i>

29:06.703 --> 29:07.662
<i>and the Raiders haven't...</i>

29:07.787 --> 29:08.997
Good.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.332
I will be back
by the end of the week.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.543
<i>You should take
more time than that.</i>

29:14.753 --> 29:17.714
Why? So you can catch up
to me in the scoring race?

29:17.839 --> 29:19.507
<i>I'm being serious.</i>

29:20.842 --> 29:21.968
<i>You know,</i>

29:22.093 --> 29:25.555
you can talk to me
about whatever.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.932
I want to help if I can.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.396
Take off your clothes.

29:33.521 --> 29:34.898
<i>What?</i>

29:35.023 --> 29:37.358
I'm also being serious.

29:37.525 --> 29:40.820
If you want to help me,
take your clothes off.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.371
Glasses back on.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.126
Stop fucking avoiding me.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.628
If only.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.342
So?

31:30.388 --> 31:31.639
So what?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.642
Don't fucking touch me.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.981
Then tell me the fucking plan.

31:40.481 --> 31:41.983
Jesus Christ.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.777
I don't know yet, Alexei!
He just died.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.654
Can I get a minute to breathe?

31:47.071 --> 31:48.573
And me?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.325
What about me?

31:51.159 --> 31:53.536
Do I get to breathe too?

31:53.995 --> 31:55.914
Or is that just something
reserved for rich faggots

31:56.039 --> 31:57.332
who abandon their families?

31:57.498 --> 31:58.666
Abandoned?

31:58.791 --> 32:01.169
Who's money do you live on,
you piece of shit?

32:01.294 --> 32:03.796
Who puts food in your mouth
and coke up your nose?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.882
I have a child, Ilya!

32:06.007 --> 32:07.675
And a fucking wife!

32:08.176 --> 32:10.386
And me, I've spent
the last five months

32:10.511 --> 32:14.223
taking care of our dying father
every fucking day!

32:15.808 --> 32:18.227
I thought I heard singing.

32:18.686 --> 32:19.604
Great.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.107
Now we have to listen to this
whore run her mouth.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.527
Stop, Ilya! Stop.

32:26.694 --> 32:29.322
He's not worth it.
He's not worth anything.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.002
You can have my apartment.

32:43.753 --> 32:46.255
And there will be a trust
for my niece.

32:47.215 --> 32:50.385
She can have it when she's 18.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.141
And you will never,
ever contact me again.

32:58.059 --> 33:01.896
If you do, I will use every
piece of my fame and money

33:02.480 --> 33:05.692
and notoriety to make sure
that you can't show your face

33:05.817 --> 33:07.110
in this fucking city

33:07.652 --> 33:10.279
without someone
wanting to break it open.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.994
So take what I offer,

33:16.953 --> 33:20.081
shut your fucking mouth
and walk away.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.782
I don't deserve you.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.784
Yes, you do.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.454
But you don't want me.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.292
You know I love you.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.252
I know you do.

34:06.377 --> 34:10.381
But it's not the same
as it is with Jane, is it?

34:12.800 --> 34:14.844
I love you too.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.722
And whatever you need,
I'll be here.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.307
I'm not going anywhere.

34:21.267 --> 34:25.772
I just hope Jane
knows how lucky he is.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.673
Hey, I'm just gonna...

34:52.799 --> 34:53.758
Have fun!

35:13.361 --> 35:15.196
How are you?

35:16.197 --> 35:17.949
<i>OK.</i>

35:18.074 --> 35:19.659
<i>Not good.</i>

35:19.784 --> 35:21.369
<i>Probably bad.</i>

35:22.620 --> 35:24.330
How's your, uh, family?

35:24.455 --> 35:25.832
<i>At their worst.</i>

35:26.958 --> 35:28.584
My brother is...

35:29.836 --> 35:31.712
I don't know. Scared.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.882
It makes him terrible.

35:36.008 --> 35:38.261
And it makes me terrible back.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.931
Is it very upsetting?

35:42.056 --> 35:43.391
<i>Yes.</i>

35:44.350 --> 35:47.061
<i>But maybe I'm upset</i>

35:47.228 --> 35:48.855
about the wrong thing.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.525
<i>You mean not your father?</i>

35:55.069 --> 35:56.779
Maybe...

35:58.239 --> 35:59.699
I...

36:00.658 --> 36:02.827
I wish it could be different.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.455
I wish he could know me, or...

36:09.375 --> 36:11.335
I don't know. I don't know.

36:11.460 --> 36:13.713
English is too hard right now.

36:14.755 --> 36:16.841
<i>I wish I spoke Russian.</i>

36:16.966 --> 36:18.259
Mmm.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.970
Yeah, you could probably
learn it in a week.

36:21.095 --> 36:23.431
No accent. Perfect.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.266
<i>Bonjour.</i>

36:25.433 --> 36:27.310
That's French, Ilya.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.937
<i>Yeah, I know, Shane.</i>

36:31.147 --> 36:32.607
Where are you?

36:33.524 --> 36:34.984
<i>I'm just walking.</i>

36:35.109 --> 36:36.903
I needed to get out.

36:38.696 --> 36:41.157
<i>Hey, uh, I have an idea.</i>

36:42.408 --> 36:45.203
<i>How about you tell me
everything that's on your mind,</i>

36:45.328 --> 36:46.704
<i>but in Russian?</i>

36:46.829 --> 36:49.707
I won't understand,
but maybe it'll help.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.212
<i>OK.</i>

37:01.761 --> 37:04.513
<i>I never want to
come back here again.</i>

37:07.099 --> 37:09.310
<i>I fucking hate it here.</i>

37:10.853 --> 37:12.897
<i>And they all fucking hate me.</i>

37:14.941 --> 37:16.442
I pay for everything.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.029
I make sure everyone
has clothes they like.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.907
I make sure the food is perfect,

37:23.616 --> 37:26.661
that Father is buried
next to his parents,

37:29.121 --> 37:31.666
that the tomb is perfect.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.669
And the only fucking word
I ever hear is:

37:35.378 --> 37:36.587
"I want more, Ilya.

37:36.712 --> 37:41.509
I need more, Ilya,
more, more, more!"

37:42.009 --> 37:44.679
And I have nothing
for these people!

37:45.721 --> 37:47.431
I give them everything...

37:48.349 --> 37:50.726
but I feel fucking empty.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.355
<i>They don't care.</i>

37:55.106 --> 37:59.443
<i>They look at me and they
see a bank. Or an enemy.</i>

37:59.568 --> 38:01.529
<i>Or I don't even know what.</i>

38:03.698 --> 38:09.537
My brother, he always hated me.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.500
And I know why, but...

38:17.211 --> 38:19.380
it kills me.

38:25.886 --> 38:29.890
And it kills me that he took
care of my father and I didn't.

38:36.188 --> 38:37.857
But I couldn't!

38:38.941 --> 38:40.693
I wasn't here.

38:42.862 --> 38:45.072
<i>I still paid for it all.</i>

38:46.407 --> 38:48.451
<i>And he will never forgive me.</i>

38:48.951 --> 38:50.536
<i>For any of it.</i>

38:50.661 --> 38:52.413
<i>For existing.</i>

38:54.373 --> 38:57.335
And it means.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.672
I have no one now.

39:03.883 --> 39:08.804
Well, not no one. I have...

39:10.973 --> 39:12.516
Svetlana.

39:16.395 --> 39:18.105
She loves me.

39:19.273 --> 39:20.900
And I love her.

39:22.943 --> 39:24.612
But not like...

39:29.784 --> 39:30.993
Fuck me.

39:44.465 --> 39:46.592
But not like I love you.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.472
That's the worst fucking part
of all this is...

39:53.516 --> 39:55.559
that all I want is you.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.145
It's always you.

40:01.524 --> 40:02.691
I'm so in love with you,

40:02.817 --> 40:05.611
and I don't know
what to do about it.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.081
<i>OK, I'm done.</i>

40:20.501 --> 40:22.378
Do you feel better?

40:22.503 --> 40:23.879
<i>Yes.</i>

40:24.755 --> 40:26.507
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:28.759 --> 40:31.345
Maybe you could
teach me Russian someday.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.681
<i>Yeah. OK.</i>

40:33.806 --> 40:35.349
<i>Only useful phrases.</i>

40:35.474 --> 40:36.684
Like what?

40:36.851 --> 40:38.394
<i>I don't know, like:</i>

40:38.519 --> 40:40.855
<i>"Harder, please. Yes, sir."</i>

40:41.021 --> 40:42.523
Fuck you.

40:42.648 --> 40:45.192
<i>No, more like:
"Fuck me, please."</i>

40:50.114 --> 40:51.615
How about...

40:51.740 --> 40:54.034
<i>"I wish you were here
right now"?</i>

41:00.374 --> 41:02.168
I wish I was too.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.726
<i>A little winter thaw</i>

41:18.851 --> 41:20.394
<i>couldn't come at a better time</i>

41:20.519 --> 41:22.521
<i>for a Montreal team
that needs to heat up right now.</i>

41:22.646 --> 41:25.399
<i>The Metros are clinging to a
wildcard spot in the playoffs.</i>

41:25.524 --> 41:27.610
<i>And tonight, they're facing
the Boston Raiders</i>

41:27.735 --> 41:29.069
<i>with Ilya Rozanov back in action</i>

41:29.236 --> 41:31.280
<i>following the passing
of his father.</i>

41:31.405 --> 41:33.032
<i>Everyone's thoughts
and prayers</i>

41:33.157 --> 41:34.742
<i>go out to the Boston captain,</i>

41:34.867 --> 41:37.244
<i>who can't have
had an easy couple of weeks.</i>

41:37.369 --> 41:39.330
<i>But counting him out
would be a mistake.</i>

41:39.455 --> 41:41.081
<i>It sure would.</i>

41:41.207 --> 41:43.584
<i>'Cause few players respond
to adversity like Rozanov.</i>

41:45.711 --> 41:48.672
We still on
for tonight? After?

41:49.965 --> 41:51.509
1919.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.596
That's the code.
For the front door.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.348
I'll text it to you.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.683
Front door. Brave.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.185
Fuck you.

42:01.310 --> 42:02.728
Later.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.444
What was that about?

42:10.611 --> 42:12.488
Oh, I just offered
my condolences.

42:12.613 --> 42:15.366
Oh, yeah. That's nice.

42:15.491 --> 42:17.243
Fuck, I should have done that.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.410
What did he say?

42:18.536 --> 42:19.495
Told me to fuck off.

42:20.663 --> 42:21.956
Jesus, what a dick.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.291
He's not that bad.
It's mostly an act.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.834
A pretty convincing one.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.212
Yeah, well, let's make sure
we win this one, right?

42:28.337 --> 42:29.797
Fucking rights!

43:04.039 --> 43:06.625
Marleau, you motherfucker!

43:08.335 --> 43:10.963
<i>You hate to see that happen.</i>

43:11.088 --> 43:12.298
<i>It looked like a clean hit.</i>

43:12.423 --> 43:14.174
<i>Hollander just
did not see it coming.</i>

43:14.300 --> 43:18.053
<i>Ilya Rozanov still on the ice,
looking very concerned.</i>

43:18.178 --> 43:21.432
<i>Not even Rozanov wants to see
someone hurt like that.</i>

43:21.557 --> 43:23.309
<i>Here come the medics.</i>

43:26.270 --> 43:29.189
<i>It's unclear
if he's responsive or not.</i>

43:29.315 --> 43:30.316
One, two, three.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.026
Is he OK? Fucking tell me!

43:32.192 --> 43:35.070
Get to your bench, Rozanov.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

43:35.195 --> 43:37.615
<i>You know, you can say what
you will about this rivalry,</i>

43:37.740 --> 43:39.033
<i>these two have played...</i>

43:40.868 --> 43:43.329
<i>Obviously, a lot of
admiration there.</i>

43:43.454 --> 43:45.289
I need you to stay awake,
OK, Shane?

43:45.414 --> 43:46.415
Eyes open, buddy.

43:46.540 --> 43:48.792
OK. My parents...

43:48.917 --> 43:51.378
Your parents, your coach
is calling them, OK?

43:51.503 --> 43:52.880
OK.

43:53.005 --> 43:55.299
Tell him I'm fine, I'm OK.

43:55.424 --> 43:56.842
Tell who?

43:56.967 --> 43:58.594
He's gonna worry.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.346
Your coach
is calling your dad.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.181
Not him, Ilya.

44:02.306 --> 44:06.185
Who? Hey, Shane, you really
need to keep your eyes open, OK?

44:27.539 --> 44:29.291
Ilya!

44:34.755 --> 44:37.883
I, um, I just wanted to...

44:40.761 --> 44:42.763
Are you OK?

44:42.888 --> 44:45.766
Concussion and
a fractured collarbone.

44:45.891 --> 44:47.935
Out for the playoffs, but...

44:48.102 --> 44:50.896
- Could have been worse.
- Could have been worse.

44:51.021 --> 44:52.523
Marleau feels terrible.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.650
He did not mean to hurt you.

44:54.775 --> 44:57.778
I know. Part of the game.

44:57.903 --> 45:00.489
We all get our bell rung
eventually, right?

45:00.614 --> 45:01.949
Right.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.827
Hey.

45:04.952 --> 45:07.329
Hey!
- OK, OK...

45:07.454 --> 45:09.623
Shhh, shhh.

45:09.790 --> 45:13.293
Yes! Better.

45:14.753 --> 45:16.630
Mmm.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.340
You scared me.

45:20.300 --> 45:23.429
I'm sorry I didn't
text you last night.

45:23.554 --> 45:25.305
No, it's OK.

45:27.182 --> 45:29.518
I was excited
about last night.

45:29.643 --> 45:33.981
I'm mostly mad at Marleau
for fucking that up.

45:34.106 --> 45:36.150
He feels really bad.

45:37.317 --> 45:40.404
You know, I had a whole
plan to ask you something.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.323
Maybe it's better
if you just rest now.

45:43.490 --> 45:45.159
- I was gonna ask you...
- Hollander...

45:45.284 --> 45:48.203
Will you come
to my cottage this summer?

45:49.121 --> 45:50.664
Don't go to Russia.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.332
Come to my house.

45:52.458 --> 45:53.917
We'll have so much fun.

45:54.042 --> 45:55.919
It's so private.
No one will know.

45:56.044 --> 45:58.005
Hollander, you know
I can't do that.

45:58.172 --> 46:00.340
We could have
a week or even two.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.677
We'd be completely alone.

46:03.844 --> 46:05.387
Together.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.058
Maybe. Maybe.

46:12.478 --> 46:13.687
Oh, no.

46:13.812 --> 46:15.022
Uh-oh!

46:15.189 --> 46:17.024
You're not gonna
smother him with a pillow,

46:17.149 --> 46:18.025
are you, Mr. Rozanov?

46:18.192 --> 46:19.610
Ah, no. No, no, no.

46:19.735 --> 46:21.028
But good thinking.

46:21.153 --> 46:23.363
But no, I was just leaving.

46:23.489 --> 46:25.616
OK, bye-bye.

46:25.741 --> 46:26.950
Goodbye.

46:27.075 --> 46:29.870
Mmm. See you next season.

46:30.037 --> 46:31.622
Get well soon, Hollander.

46:31.747 --> 46:35.209
Thank you. I appreciate it.

46:37.377 --> 46:38.712
Hello!

46:38.837 --> 46:40.547
- Hello!
- Ah!

46:42.216 --> 46:43.467
<i>It's still in a sling,</i>

46:43.592 --> 46:45.803
but I can lose the thing
in a few days, I think.

46:45.928 --> 46:47.221
<i>How's jerking off?</i>

46:47.346 --> 46:49.681
Ma'am, I'm at my
parents' house, so...

46:49.807 --> 46:51.350
<i>So, constant? Endless?</i>

46:52.518 --> 46:53.936
Pretty much.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.604
Um, how are the reshoots going?

46:55.729 --> 46:56.855
<i>Fine.</i>

46:56.980 --> 46:58.482
I mean, this movie
makes no sense.

46:59.608 --> 47:00.692
It doesn't!

47:00.818 --> 47:02.027
<i>At least you're getting paid</i>

47:02.152 --> 47:03.070
<i>properly this time.</i>

47:03.195 --> 47:04.571
I miss being kidnapped.

47:04.696 --> 47:06.198
I regret shapeshifting.

47:06.323 --> 47:07.741
<i>My parents keep asking</i>

47:07.908 --> 47:09.910
if you're gonna
come by this summer.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.328
<i>Well, I still might!</i>

47:11.453 --> 47:13.163
<i>They can't keep me here
till September.</i>

47:13.288 --> 47:14.456
<i>I'm gonna lose my mind.</i>

47:14.581 --> 47:16.124
I don't think that's
what they mean.

47:16.250 --> 47:17.334
<i>Well, just tell them.</i>

47:17.459 --> 47:19.294
- Rose...
- <i>Just do it.</i>

47:19.419 --> 47:22.172
<i>Tell them I'm gay and you
got sick of being my beard.</i>

47:23.090 --> 47:24.424
I can't lie to them.

47:24.591 --> 47:25.592
Um...

47:25.717 --> 47:27.719
<i>More than I already have.</i>

47:27.845 --> 47:29.137
I think they'd love it.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.557
And then they'd have
to keep my secret.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.433
My big lesbian secret.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.478
Oh, God. I wish.

47:36.603 --> 47:37.980
Same.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.065
<i>They probably would love that.</i>

47:40.190 --> 47:41.608
Third period's starting.

47:41.733 --> 47:42.901
Coming!

47:43.777 --> 47:45.279
OK, I gotta go,

47:45.404 --> 47:47.614
but let me know what you decide
about Labor Day weekend.

47:47.739 --> 47:48.949
<i>I will. I love you.</i>

47:49.116 --> 47:50.868
<i>Rozanov coming up
the right wing</i>

47:50.993 --> 47:52.452
<i>with Hunter staying on him.</i>

47:52.619 --> 47:54.955
<i>Rozanov tries to push past him
with no luck.</i>

47:55.122 --> 47:57.291
He's playing hurt.
It's his ribs, I bet.

47:57.457 --> 47:59.501
- How do you know that?
- Am I right?

47:59.626 --> 48:00.586
I don't know.

48:00.711 --> 48:02.129
Your mother's a witch.

48:03.088 --> 48:04.715
OK, the Raiders have lost.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.300
Dinner to celebrate.

48:06.466 --> 48:07.217
- Dad!
- What?

48:07.342 --> 48:08.802
We don't hate him anymore?

48:08.927 --> 48:09.803
I can't keep up!

48:09.970 --> 48:11.305
No, we do, just...

48:11.430 --> 48:13.223
Rosanov went to see Shane
in the hospital.

48:13.348 --> 48:14.683
Oh, so now you like him.

48:14.808 --> 48:16.143
Well, now I hate him less.

48:17.102 --> 48:18.687
And good for Scott Hunter.

48:18.812 --> 48:20.314
Why good for Scott Hunter?

48:20.480 --> 48:22.149
I don't know.
It's his year.

48:22.316 --> 48:24.151
How can you possibly
know that?

48:24.276 --> 48:26.111
- She's a witch!
- Stop it with that.

48:26.236 --> 48:28.071
- Or what?
- Or I'll cast a spell.

48:57.142 --> 48:59.353
Turn off all the lights
when you go to bed.

48:59.478 --> 49:01.313
And stop staring at the screen.

49:01.438 --> 49:04.441
My head is fine,
and I'm a fully grown adult.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.851
<i>And in less than one minute,</i>

49:39.977 --> 49:41.687
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

49:41.812 --> 49:44.314

done what they set out to do,</i>

49:44.439 --> 49:46.316
<i>finally bringing the Cup

<i>After over a decade
in the wilderness,</i>

49:48.568 --> 49:50.696
<i>Scott Hunter
and his teammates taking...</i>

49:50.821 --> 49:51.863
I told you!

49:52.990 --> 49:54.074
Who are you texting?

49:54.241 --> 49:55.242
Hayden.

49:55.367 --> 49:56.535
Oh, how's the baby?

49:56.660 --> 49:57.995
Great!

49:58.120 --> 50:00.163
<i>...is finally

50:00.288 --> 50:02.290
<i>Fifteen seconds remaining.</i>

50:02.416 --> 50:03.959
<i>Marleau holds it
behind the net.</i>

50:04.084 --> 50:07.087
<i>Ten seconds remaining
as Marleau passes it.</i>

50:09.047 --> 50:11.133
<i>They're running out the clock.</i>

50:11.258 --> 50:13.260
<i>The New York crowd
is on its feet.</i>

50:13.427 --> 50:15.095
<i>They can't believe it!</i>

50:15.220 --> 50:16.888
<i>And there you have it!</i>

50:17.014 --> 50:19.641
<i>82 regular season games,
23 playoff performances,</i>

50:19.766 --> 50:22.102

50:22.269 --> 50:24.855
<i>for the first time in 28 years!</i>

50:24.980 --> 50:26.356
<i>Your 2017 champions!</i>

50:26.481 --> 50:28.942
<i>They've done it!
I cannot believe it.</i>

50:29.067 --> 50:32.612
<i>I cannot believe what
I am witnessing right now!</i>

50:39.619 --> 50:43.248
<i>Your champions
are the New York Admirals!</i>

50:43.373 --> 50:47.794
<i>The 2017 Champions!</i>

51:02.726 --> 51:04.186

51:07.522 --> 51:08.815

51:08.982 --> 51:10.609
I'm not sad.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.527

51:14.446 --> 51:16.281
Yes! Let's fucking go, bro!
