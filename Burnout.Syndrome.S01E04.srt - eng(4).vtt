Viewer discretion is advised.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.960
I want to do this awful job.

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.940
Give me a reason
why I should take you back.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.500
Be my model, and I’ll be your Mr. K.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.800
You get something out of this deal
as an employer,

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.600
and I get something as an employee.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.250
You have flirty eyes.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.979
Do you do this with everyone?

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.030
If I told you that you’re the only one
I do this with,

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:44.950
would you believe me?

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.420
Come see me right now.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.600
Otherwise, our deal is off.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.690
What do you want me for?

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.229
You’re sleeping with me tonight.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.330
Get in bed.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.950
Get in bed.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.200
What are you going to do?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.180
Isn’t it obvious?

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.000
What is?

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.900
Am I here to screw you?

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.300
Can you do that?

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.200
I’ll pay you extra for it.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.329
I’m not ready.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.700
I didn’t come prepared.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.500
You didn’t give me any heads up
so I didn’t expect it.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.700
There’s a bathroom.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.450
You’re free to use it to get ready.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.200
How much will you pay me for it?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.550
So money really can buy anything?

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.500
Well, not today.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.150
I only called you to sleep with me.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.900
I’ll pay you what we agreed on.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.250
Why must I sleep with you?

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.700
Are you a child?

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.900
Do you need someone to coddle you?

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.200
Here’s the thing.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.750
I fell asleep this afternoon.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.470
It happened to be the first time
I could sleep soundly without drugs.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.350
So I thought it might be you
who helped me sleep.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.400
Ugh.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.430
That had nothing to do with it.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.180
It did.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.000
I piled my bed with all these clothes
and I still wouldn’t fall asleep.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.610
So it must be you.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.550
I can’t sleep in my dirty clothes.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.800
I need a shower.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.000
I don’t want to wait.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.900
I’m going to bed now.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.250
Come sit here.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.100
You can take a shower when I fall asleep.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.050
What should I do

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.350
to lull you to sleep?

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.270
Talk to me.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.960
Ugh.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.750
I don’t want to talk to you.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.450
We’re only going to fight.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.769
You’re not exactly like other people,
you know?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.600
Why?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.650
What kind of man do you think I am?

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.900
You’re like a villain in a movie.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.159
That’s who you chose as your model?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.050
Look.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.630
You have to understand

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.870
emotions and art are unpredictable things.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.150
Good things may not inspire,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.700
but sometimes evil…

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.450
makes a better inspiration.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.500
Can I ask you something?

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.330
Why do you like my work?

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.950
Because your drawing

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.930
makes me see myself the way
I never did before.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.100
What do you hate about it?

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.850
It’s not exactly that there’s anything
I hate about it.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.250
It’s just that I want to know
more about him.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.180
Just keep being your evil self.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.700
I’ll come up with a way to portray it.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.850
I must seem very evil from
your point of view.

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.350
Is there any possibility

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.830
that you might like me?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.930
What?

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.380
Do you like me?

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.450
As an object of art, I do like you.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.380
You seem to be brimming with
contradictions.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.500
And as a human being?

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.600
What’s this ambiguous question?

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.600
Are you hitting on me?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.270
No.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.700
I just want to know how you feel about me.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.870
I don’t like you.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.930
Someone like you does more harm
than good for the world.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.530
Did you hear me?

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.040
Hey.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.170
Hey.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.700
Hey.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.900
Hey!

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.450
The way he’s deep asleep…

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.350
And he said he has insomnia.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.430
Hey.

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:38.850
How did you sleep last night?

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.400
Like I was dead.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.300
You hungry? Breakfast?

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.850
No.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.790
I want to go home.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.990
Good.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.380
I’m hiring you for another half a day.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.250
Go swimming with me.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.170
I can’t swim.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.500
It’s alright.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.870
I’ll teach you.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.350
As long as you pay.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.250
I’m gonna grab something to eat first.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.400
You didn’t get it last night,
did you, bud?

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.430
What do you mean?

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.900
He just left this morning.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.230
I see.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.450
If you’re just lying to me,
I’d believe you.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.150
But something else gave you away.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.600
-Whoops!
-Hey!

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.450
If you’re pacing the room like this,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.300
he left last night, didn’t he?

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.050
Get your nose out of my business,
you know-it-all.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.180
My poor buddy.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.650
Did your charms finally run out?

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.050
Why don’t you go and rub that off?

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.000
I don’t feel like it.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.100
Crap, Mawin.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.900
I feel really weird.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.400
I…

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.700
I was left hanging, wasn’t I?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:38.650
Hmm.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.050
I’m supposed to be irritated, right?

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.900
Hmm.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.000
But I feel…

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.370
I want to see him again.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.320
You’re in trouble.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.350
What?

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.000
For normal men, like me,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.450
we’ve felt like that multiple times.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.600
But for a god like you,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.600
this is probably the first time

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.450
that you’ve been ditched.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.300
What you’re feeling right now is
what I term ‘post-ditch disorder.’

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.700
You’ll miss them like crazy.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.730
You’ll want them really badly.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.600
All you do is think about them
all day, all night.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.470
You’re head over heels.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.430
That’s the symptoms.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.300
It sounds more like I’ve been cursed.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.830
What do I have to do?

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.250
You just have to get him at all costs.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.650
What are you staring at me for?

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.650
I’m just looking.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.810
What makes you want to
have a swim now?

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.870
My therapist suggested
I took up exercising

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.330
to help with my insomnia.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.000
What about you?

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.750
Do you know any swimming basics?

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.450
None.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.450
I’d say…

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.650
Not at all.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.600
It’s okay.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.550
Half of the world’s population
doesn’t know how to swim.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.050
But if you’re staying with me,

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.200
you need to be able to swim.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.050
Come on. I’ll teach you.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.200
Is it dangerous?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.000
I won’t let you die.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.980
You sure you know what you’re doing?

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:48.500
Alright.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.600
First of all,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.330
you need to breathe in
through your mouth,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.700
and out through your nose.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:57.970
Ready?

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.650
One.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.200
Two.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.350
Three.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.800
Hold on. Hold on.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:07.970
Let’s try it again.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.780
One, two, three.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.250
Let’s try again.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.900
You did it wrong.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.780
Take the air in through your mouth.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.500
when you’re under water,
breathe out through your nose.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.270
Let’s do it.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.070
One.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.300
Two.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.300
Three.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:49.570
It’s too hard.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.930
Can we do this some other time?

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.700
Don’t be discouraged.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.900
You know what?

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.120
I have a trick.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.180
This might sound nonsensical,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.050
but when people kiss,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.010
they often unknowingly hold their breath.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.050
Can I even trust you?

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.050
If you want to learn how to swim fast,
you gotta try.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.650
To kiss or to drown?

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.000
If you kiss me,
I’m charging you extra for it.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.490
This is still work, after all.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.250
Alright.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.970
You’ll do anything for money, won’t you?

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:27.830
Ready?

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:30.730
One.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.350
Two.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.850
Three.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.360
Hey.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.270
Let’s do it some other time.
I’ve had it today.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.100
Hey.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.820
Where are you going?

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.570
Come back and get this done.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.070
Hey.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:08.930
You can place it here.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.730
Yeah?

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.610
Hello.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.100
Can you…

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.250
Can you tell me something stressful,
or something…

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.700
Something sad?

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.000
Tell me now.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.450
What the hell’s going on now?

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.340
Just tell me.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.430
Come on!

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:26.700
Nope.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.110
Not unless you tell me
why you want me to.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.200
I… came for a swim with Koh.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.050
(And…)

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.330
And?

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.530
(And what?)

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.650
(Can you tell me already?)

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.050
And I happened to get aroused
and it won’t come down.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.140
(So just tell me already!)

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.340
Oh, you.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.100
You’re out of your mind, you know?

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.330
Why are you even calling me
about something like that?

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.830
Just go and jerk off.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Thank you.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.180
Your advice is immensely useless.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.220
You bitch.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.430
Hey.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.770
Hey.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:23.900
What?

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.400
What?

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.530
You okay?

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.030
You were gone for a while.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.550
It’s just…

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.370
My leg hurts.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.170
I don’t think I can swim.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.400
Let me see.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.560
No.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.700
You were probably just nervous.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.550
Why don’t you try it another time
and maybe you’ll calm down?

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.600
It’s alright. I’ll handle this.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:52.780
Okay.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.620
That’s it for today, then.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.870
How hard are you going to work, lady?

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.170
Are you going to take on
every job yourself?

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.700
Who survives on one job these days?

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.930
You know the curator job doesn’t pay well.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.500
I only do it because I want to.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.080
By the way, this is Ball.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.740
Mr. Ball, this is Jira.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.500
He’s a friend of mine.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.100
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.950
I’ve been a fan of yours.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.250
I was fortunate enough to see
one of your work with some flowers,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.700
and a man with a lotus tattoo
holding a lotus.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.460
I’m also working on
nude sketches right now.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.770
That piece of work was
from when I first started.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.420
I was trying to come out through my art,

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.430
but I just wasn’t really ready.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.850
I guess the message isn’t as clear as
the one in my work today.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.180
Thank you for bringing it up, though.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.900
Why don’t you come take a look
when this is done?

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.800
You like floral design, right?

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.450
Of course I will.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.300
Are you busy right now?

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.900
I have something I need your advice on.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:26.760
I came straight here from work.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:28.200
Of course.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.300
Take a breath.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:31.810
Let’s go have a seat.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.200
You’ve calmed down now?

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.100
I think you get like this because of Koh.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.470
You like him.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:47.930
I don’t like him.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.380
How could I fancy a jerk like him?

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.850
What a dream you’re living, huh?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.850
You have a boy at home and a boy at work.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.650
Ugh.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.270
I told you I’m not interested in him.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.000
I’m into Pheem.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:02.700
I’m kinda annoyed.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.350
Things were going well
when the jerk called me up.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.700
And I had to go to him.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.400
Don’t act like this wasn’t you.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.020
You had a choice,

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.950
and you chose to let him have his way.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.100
I had to do it.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.980
We had an agreement.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.600
You’re so full of excuses.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.300
I’ve seen it time and time again,
those that start off like this

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.130
always end up together,

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.300
together,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.050
together.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.680
Stop it!

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.100
Please.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.450
Can you get in your advisor mode already?

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:47.700
Honestly,

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:56.230
a muse doesn’t need to be involved
with their artist physically.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.700
Some artists are married,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.970
and don’t make their wives their muses.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.870
Take the Renaissance artists, for example.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.270
A muse can be anything.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.450
A beautiful lady, a princess,

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.070
a young boy,

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.570
anything is possible.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:23.740
But I do think you need to separate
work from desire.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.850
Koh is work.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.110
Pheem…

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:33.530
is desire.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.430
Is that it?

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:51.450
You had lunch?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.530
None of your business.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.430
You?

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.100
None of your business.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.240
Just say what you’re here to say.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.600
Save the prelude.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.600
There’s an award event by Next Tech
the day after tomorrow.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.850
Koh won an award for the Khao app.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.190
I want you to accept the award
in his place at the event.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:11.800
Alright?

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.050
I’m busy.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.600
Liar. I checked your schedule.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:18.290
Look at me.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.100
My schedule is none of your business.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.030
Let me ask you this.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.490
Why should I accept it for him?

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.120
Jerk.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.200
It’s good for you, you know?

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.570
There will be lots of people in the industry.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.550
You’ll get a lot of connections there.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:35.530
Just do it.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.600
Did you see the email from Next Tech
about the Khao app?

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.900
I already guessed a guy like you
wouldn’t show up.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.500
So I found someone to go in your place.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:47.470
No need.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.650
Just write a thank you note
like we usually do.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.550
It wouldn’t hurt to keep
a good relationship with them.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.200
Next Tech is full of big names, you know?

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.970
If we have any problems,
we can ask them for help.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.830
None of them will actually help
when the time comes.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:03.870
Just send someone in your place.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.850
This Khao app is your last saving grace.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.000
We need good PR

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.530
before you go and fuck things up
in the future.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:20.630
Okay.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.070
I’ll find someone.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.700
But don’t you dare tell anyone
at the event.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.150
I understand.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.030
You must be concerned for
your safety, per usual.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.900
Didn’t that therapist help you
crack this problem?

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.900
Not yet.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.400
Is that all?

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.950
No.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.500
I’m taking some photos of your place.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.500
The R&D department needs them.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.650
I told you I’d send them to you.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.250
I’d be damned if I trusted you.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.750
I told you last week and
you didn’t send me anything,

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.700
They were nagging me for it.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.400
Which part of the room do you need?

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.200
All over the place, I guess.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.200
They need to know where to place stuff

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.900
and measure it for
the facial expression scanner.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.050
Do whatever you want.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.850
Your favorite wine.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.130
Drink it.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.400
No!

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.800
You guys can’t freaking die!

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:10.240
Don’t die.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.140
Don’t die. Don’t die.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.100
Don’t die on me.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:39.900
Hello?

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:41.800
You busy?

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.930
I can talk.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.700
I’m watering my plants.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.100
I’ve been busy so they’ve been starving
these past few days.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.470
(Is it because of Koh?)

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:53.100
Yeah.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.120
He takes up too much of my time.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.700
Why did you call me?

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.470
Nothing.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.990
Just because.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.500
Is that okay?

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.570
I just want to hear your voice, you know?

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.570
You want to hear my voice?

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:08.930
Oh, no!

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.200
What?

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.600
Jira, what happened?

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.250
My orchid.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.570
It’s blooming!

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.800
I thought it was a matter
of life and death.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.100
Isn’t it strange?

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.400
I’d been watering it for a long time
and it refused to bloom.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.100
But once it’s starving,
it finally blossoms.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.200
I guess it’s got a fighting spirit
spurred by survival.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:40.670
(What do you mean?)

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:47.700
Well, the body is dying,
so it blooms to reproduce.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.000
(I see.)

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.950
It must be cool to be an orchid.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.540
To have the power to bloom
on the verge of death…

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.850
What a tough flower.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.100
Aren’t we all like that?

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.500
Yeah.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.380
What’s your next plan?

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.300
I didn’t know what to do at first,

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.750
but now that you called me,
I have an idea to sketch you.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.430
Are you for real?

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:23.340
(Hmm.)

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:25.950
Do you want me to sit for you?

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.230
No need.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.850
I’ll draw you from my memories.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.320
I remember all the good moments,
you know?

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.850
Wow, you must be a genius.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:37.430
Crap.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.750
Koh is calling me.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.100
(Doesn’t he know
when not to bother people?)

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:44.870
You have to take it.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.770
No, I don’t.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.460
Oh, okay.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.870
I should probably stop taking your time
so you can draw.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.100
Will you tell me when you’re done?

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.600
I want to see it for myself.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.790
Hey.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.170
What time do you think it is?

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.630
What’s going on?

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.120
I can’t sleep.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.650
Can you come see me?

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.700
What’s wrong?

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.100
(Headache.)

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.150
Did you throw up again?

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.410
No.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.780
I just can’t sleep.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:12.960
So hurry up and come here.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.700
You can’t keep doing this.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.100
I’m not going.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.570
The commute is exhausting, you know?

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.550
Then stay on the phone with me.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.000
Just say anything.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.870
I just want to hear your voice.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.700
My voice won’t help you.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:29.750
What are you doing?

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.670
Drawing.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.200
What are you drawing?

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:43.700
How about this?

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.650
I’ll talk to you while I paint,
so I don’t have to come over.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.570
Okay.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.230
Which part are you painting?

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.380
You look really good in your sleep
in the drawing.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:11.670
You know why?

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.170
Tell me.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.270
Because you look harmless.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.110
But when you’re awake,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.400
I freaking don’t like you.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:25.700
Too bad,

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.200
but I have a new job for you.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.270
You’re talking about work
when you’re trying to sleep?

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.240
Close your eyes.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:35.870
(Are your eyes closed?)

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:38.670
No.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.400
How’d you sleep
if you don’t close your eyes?

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:48.800
I’m closing them now.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.690
(So what’s happening next?)

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.340
(Tell me.)

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.950
From the drawing,

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.130
you’re lying naked
on a soft pile of laundry.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.500
No one can resist falling asleep on it.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.550
I’m naked again?

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.660
You’re always naked around me.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:16.730
(What else?)

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.050
You’re sentimental.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.000
You’re waiting for someone

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.700
to bring you into dreamland.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.100
Will someone finally come for me?

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:31.450
(No.)

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.950
Can’t you add that?

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.400
I want to see it.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.750
I’m drawing an angel…

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:12.780
He’s kissing you to bless you to sleep.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.200
Why is he helping me?

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.900
Because he knows you’re fragile,

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:33.900
unlike the vicious exterior you put up.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.580
Hey.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.120
Hey.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.060
Hey!

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.740
I didn’t know I could do that remotely.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:39.100
Pheem.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.500
Can I borrow your clothes?

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.460
I have a job interview.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.710
Pheem, you hear me?

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.940
Lend me your clothes!

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:52.660
Pheem?

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:57.440
Here.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.330
Try them on.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.000
What job interview are you heading out to?

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.850
Are there any IT job openings?

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.470
I didn’t see any.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.450
There’s this content analytics job.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.600
What’s that?

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.700
Well, it’s basically studying
viewers’ behavior

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:26.230
and researching content statistics
to see what people like to watch

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.400
to know what kind of films
or series to make.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.380
I see.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:31.900
Hold on.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.350
You know anything about films?

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:36.250
Nope.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.810
But I do work with data and statistics,
you know?

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:43.350
Come here.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:49.840
How do I look?

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.400
Aren’t you usually very self-assured?

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.270
What got into you that you need
my assurance today?

00:32:58.690 --> 00:32:59.200
Look.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.000
Isn’t it normal for a man to feel insecure
when leaving his safe zone?

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:09.500
Here. I have this.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.100
Hey. What’s that?

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.100
Give me your wrist.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:21.950
Wait.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.900
Isn’t that the same perfume you wore
the other day and got ditched?

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.980
I can’t lose out on this job, dude.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:30.700
Jerk. Don’t blame my perfume.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.050
Whether you get the job or not,
it depends on you.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.000
Would your perfume last till this evening?

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.850
I’ll show up at the award event
after I get this done.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.050
Why are you going?

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.040
Koh will be there.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.160
He will?

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:50.930
Yeah.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.470
I’m going anyway.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.170
Didn’t you say I need
to make some connections?

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.000
I’m here for Mr. Koh’s appointment.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.030
Can I have the keycard, please?

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.699
Please follow me.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.449
Where are we going?

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:24.900
You’re late, Mr. Jira.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.350
Mr. Koh asked to change
the location of this meeting.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.600
Over here.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.730
What time did I tell you to come
and what time did you come?

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:57.900
It’s all your fault.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.060
You stayed on the phone
almost until morning.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.170
Who’d be able to wake up?

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.200
Isn’t that good?

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.650
You got paid for overtime.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.150
I got to sleep well.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:11.200
Thanks.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.050
Whose company am I taking over today?

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.950
You’re accepting an award for mine.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.650
I won the Honorary Developer award
from Next Tech.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.700
Did you buy it?

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.700
Hey.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:28.780
This award can’t be bought with money.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:29.700
Take this seriously.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.950
Just repeat my words when the time comes.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.800
You gonna be done soon?

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.460
No.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.900
Hey.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:08.370
Why don’t you just get out properly?

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.350
I won’t dent the seat with my size.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:13.170
Listen.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:15.300
I love this car.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.100
So be gentle with it.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.380
Aren’t I amazing?

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.800
I didn’t even stain it.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.010
Stop it.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.180
Don’t be pushing buttons
on someone else’s car.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.300
You’re definitely the type to love
your car more than your wife.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.970
Mawin from Hive Tech.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:49.400
Please sign your name.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.150
Of course.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.300
Stop sniffing.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.500
Go.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.970
Your name, please.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.530
Korawic.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.000
Oh, you’re Mr. Koh Korawic.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.200
Please wait here for a moment.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.730
I’ll inform our staff.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.700
We didn’t know you were attending.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.920
Hello, Mr. Koh.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.170
We’re really glad to have you today.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.500
Will you please follow me to the lounge?

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.200
And the last of tonight’s biggest award…

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.500
(Khao application AR for farmers)

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:43.400
(connects farmers and allows them
to get answers about diseases in rice,)

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.590
(as well as other pants
and how to deal with them…)

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.330
So you do do something good, too.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.800
It’s an old project.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.500
I don’t need your compliment.

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.250
And the award for Honorary Developer
goes to…

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.500
Mr. Korawic Kitiwela from
the application Khao.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.550
Mr. Korawic, this way, please.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:12.400
Please, welcome Mr. Monton Kongpard,
the CEO of Next Tech, to give this award.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.590
A round of applause, please.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.250
Please stand for a photo.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:31.850
Thank you.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.820
Will Mr. Korawic say something
on this occasion?

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.350
Please give him a round of applause.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.880
Uhh…

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.000
Thank you for this award.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.500
Thank you so much for this award.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.920
I first started this application…

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.590
I first started this application…

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:58.350
-…as a part of my college project.
-…as a part of my college project.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.900
I didn’t expect it to be useful to people.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:03.980
It’s truly an honor.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.000
Everyone here is the best
in the IT industry.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.400
So I want to be straightforward

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.560
since the news that are
currently circulating

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:16.940
are a discredit to my past…

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:20.600
I know there are currently
certain news about me,

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.360
about my past.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.180
My identity.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.400
-(My identity.)
-And my transparency.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:26.700
My transparency.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.670
-(I take this opportunity to announce…)
-I take this opportunity…

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.240
to announce a new project
to reshape my image.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:35.400
-(It’s called the Hive Mind.)
-It’s called the Hive Mind.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.380
This project isn’t just an application
or a software.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.100
It’s the future.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.010
Both your future…

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.300
Both your future…

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:44.060
(…and mine.)

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.780
…and mine.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:48.600
I promise to take good care of anyone
who joins me on this journey.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:49.730
That is all.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.650
Bullshit!

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.200
(You’re all talk!)

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.170
You’ll only leave them out to dry
like piss and shit!

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.290
(Asshole!)

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.580
(You promise beautiful things
but you can’t keep your own word.)

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:10.210
(Shit.)

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.500
Let go of me!

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.350
Get out of there.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.750
I say get out of there!

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.500
Jira!

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.950
No photos, please.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.300
We’re really sorry, sir.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.730
-We’re truly sorry.
-It’s alright.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.660
Are you alright?

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.430
It’s alright.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:29.670
I think it’s urine.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.900
You’re only staining yourself.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.900
What are you doing?

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.100
I told you to leave!

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:34.780
-We’re sorry. We’re truly sorry.
-It’s alright.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.050
Get out!

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.450
What the hell was that all about?

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.450
I didn’t think something like that
would happen.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.050
Tell me who you are.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.670
Am I going to keep being
the target of harassment like this?

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.400
I’m sorry.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.730
Please calm down.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:25.500
We’ll talk in the car.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:26.700
What is there to talk about?

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.450
I just got washed in piss!

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:32.780
If that was going to happen, you should
have put it in the freaking contract.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:34.470
It’s my fault.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:35.010
Get in the car.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:35.930
I ain’t getting in the car.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.700
I don’t want to see you anymore.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.800
And I bet you don’t want to
smell piss on you.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:40.900
Let’s call it a day.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.700
Take it.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:43.220
Hey!

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:44.830
Let go!

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.750
Let go of me.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:50.830
I’m not letting you go.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.010
It’s dangerous outside.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:53.950
Come here.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:54.810
Get in the car.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.500
Where do you live?

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.330
I’ll give you a ride.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.100
Tell me your address.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:28.300
Just drive. I’ll let you know.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:32.900
I thought you loved your car.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.400
Why did you let me get in?

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.000
I do love it.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:49.850
But it doesn’t really matter.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:09.200
Just pull over right here.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:16.780
Here.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:20.700
Unlock the door.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:22.970
Which room is yours?

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.600
I’ll walk you to your door.

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:25.500
Why?

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:29.350
You think someone’s going to
throw piss at me again?

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:33.100
Okay.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:35.700
You can go.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:00.940
Hello.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:01.870
(Hey.)

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.800
(You’re home yet?)

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.200
Yes.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.530
Why are you calling?
I’m getting in the shower.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.300
O–Okay, alright.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.400
What’s this all about?

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.170
What is it?

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.350
I’m worried about you.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:19.000
Ugh!

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:58.700
I’ll give you one chance only.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:59.900
So let it all out.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.400
I won’t hold it against you.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.260
Are you sure you can take it?

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.380
The man you threw piss at wasn’t Koh.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.700
He’s my guy.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.410
Shit.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:12.370
Oh?

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:15.100
How did you get here?

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.350
I came because I was worried about you.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.900
I didn’t think you’d be busy.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:22.060
Are you upset and walking away

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:23.500
because you’re being jealous?
