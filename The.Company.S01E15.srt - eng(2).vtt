=Season 1=

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.900
=Episode 15=

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.780
(Guangling Residence)

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.060
(Sun Zhixuan, Stepmadam of Guangling)

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.199
I already said I do not want to go.

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.919
Why must you force me to meet
that so called heir?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.220
There is no need.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:25.919
(Somehow,)

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.360
(the very first moment
I saw the Princess,)

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.919
(I felt)

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.719
(that there was some kind
of connection between us.)

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.400
(To confirm my suspicion,)

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.759
(I followed the carriage)

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.960
(to the restaurant.)

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.919
This way, please.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.910
We look forward to serving you again.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.199
This way, please.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.719
Please come inside.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.080
The honored guests
are not eating this duck.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.390
You can split it among yourselves.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:05.360
Young lady.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.759
Young lady.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.319
Such a fine duck.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.280
Why throw it away?

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.039
The guests from Guangling Residence
will not eat it.

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.960
They said the Princess
has a cold constitution.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.879
She cannot eat duck.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.800
Otherwise, she will break out in rashes.

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.719
That steward even scolded me just now.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.120
(That child)

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.919
(has the same cold constitution as I do.)

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.960
(As soon as she eats duck,)

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.599
(rashes break out all over her body.)

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.759
All these years,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.360
there has been a question
weighing on my heart.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.840
At last,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.360
I found the maid

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.560
who once gave me
a bowl of water out of kindness.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.560
I knelt outside her door.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.599
Seeing how pitiful I was,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.919
she finally told me the truth.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.520
Back then,

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.520
my child did not die at all.

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.080
On the contrary,

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.000
the child was taken away by them

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.240
to replace the stillborn child

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.240
of the Madam of Guangling.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:18.639
How is she?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.680
She is fine.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.839
She just passed out.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.160
Look at this child.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.680
Why bring him before me?

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:27.240
The child of the person
who killed my sister

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.720
has no place in this world.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.399
Deal with it immediately.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.879
Why do I hear a baby crying?

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.839
A child?

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.839
This is my wife's child and mine.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.480
Master.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.920
This child is not...

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.800
He is.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.120
Give him to me.

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.879
He is my son.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.560
He is still alive.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.199
He is the flesh and blood
of my wife and me.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.519
You speak rightly.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.680
In that case,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.399
I am willing to take my sister's place

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.759
and raise this child.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.399
(After that,)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.120
(I slowly learned the truth)

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.279
(of what had happened)

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.319
(during the years I was away from Lin'an.)

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.040
(It turned out that Xuan
became the stepmadam.)

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.600
(She later bore children of her own,)

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.439
(one of them being the Princess's uncle.)

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:04.560
As for my poor son,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.160
he became an eyesore to her,

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.000
a thorn she could not tolerate.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:12.600
Only a few years
after the old prince passed,

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.560
my young child

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.439
also died far too early.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.959
Fortunately,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.560
he left behind his only bloodline,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.079
his one and only flesh and blood.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.680
That child is you, Your Highness.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.560
Come.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.240
(Once I understood all of this,)

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.959
(I knew)

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.959
(that if the stepmadam
learned I was still alive,)

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.959
(I would surely not survive.)

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:51.680
(So)

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.000
(I could only pretend to be mute,)

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.800
(and earn a living by roasting tea
for Guangling Residence.)

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:00.000
(All I ever wanted)

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:03.319
(was the chance, now and then,)

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.920
(from far away,)

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.600
(to catch a glimpse)

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.279
(of my little Princess,)

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.319
my precious granddaughter.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:19.839
So,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.399
you are my grandmother.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.360
All the tea I have drunk these years,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.040
and the camellias by my desk,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.920
they were all from you.

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.360
My child,

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:36.319
I have been useless.

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:38.959
I could do nothing for you.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.959
All I could manage,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.920
was to send you
one lovely bouquet each day.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:48.959
Thank you.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.480
If not for that
single bouquet of flowers,

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:56.279
I would never have held on this long.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.199
Silly child,

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:00.600
it is I who should thank you.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.120
If I had not seen you that day,

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:05.800
outside Guangling Residence,

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.000
I would have lost
all will to go on living.

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:12.639
You were the reason I stayed alive.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:16.079
I told myself I had to live on.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.240
I had to live long enough

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.079
to see you grow up,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.480
to see the day you married.

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:28.800
Only then would I die without regret.

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:32.559
But

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.720
I never imagined

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:37.159
they would treat you like this.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:39.360
My child,

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.799
you must not go back.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.360
You must never go back.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.240
Never return there again.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.039
Do you understand?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.639
Grandmother.

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:50.159
Lan.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.000
Lan.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.480
Grandmother.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.480
Let Lan lie down first.

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:54.159
Grandmother.

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:55.279
Please step outside.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.279
I just need to rest.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.480
Just let me rest.

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:00.600
I will stay.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.279
I will take care of her.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.399
Come.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.250
Grandmother, let me
tuck the blanket over you.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.320
My...

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.799
My precious granddaughter.

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:22.320
Good.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.000
Good.

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:27.159
I never imagined

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.799
we would witness Xia Zelan
in her final years.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.279
Boss.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.759
Please get up.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.559
Get up.

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:37.360
I am begging you.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.520
Let me stay with Lan a little longer.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.919
The Kun Blade has already been found.

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:43.919
Lan has suffered far too much.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:46.440
I cannot bear to leave her all alone.

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:49.960
Get up first.

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:53.200
That is right.

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:55.279
And Princess Yan Rong as well.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.080
Neither of them is truly out of danger.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.240
We cannot simply walk away.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.279
Thank you.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.679
You should go.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.559
Take Yan Rong

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.799
and leave this place.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.080
I am an old body, worn and sick.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:54.399
Let me face whatever comes.

00:10:56.799 --> 00:11:00.639
Do not worry about me.

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.440
Lan.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.240
In one lifetime,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.640
one must have something to hold on to.

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:11.720
If you know there is someone

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.360
whether you are together

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320
or apart,

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:20.440
no matter what road you walk,

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:23.799
who never stops thinking of you,

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.879
then in this lifetime,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.559
has one truly lived in vain?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.039
Let us go that way.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:16.399
I have lived here for so long,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.879
yet I never knew

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.679
there was a place like this.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.240
It feels so much like

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.080
the place where we
once lived for a long time.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.300
It was called the River of Oblivion.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.639
There was water,

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:39.320
there were flowers,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.840
even the leaves were crimson red.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.080
Along the horizon,

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.519
there was a band of sunset
that never seemed to fade.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:57.120
Do you think this place

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:00.600
might be a dream?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.879
Perhaps

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:13.159
it truly is a dream.

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:20.559
Lan.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:22.679
The Lan you once were,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.679
even when you knew we would part,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.919
you always faced it with a smile.

00:13:30.919 --> 00:13:32.840
People at Tianguang Market once told me

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.200
that every meeting there

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.399
was like a line of poetry.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.519
A lamp gives birth to fire,

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.000
dust scatters
like a carp borne on the wind.

00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:48.080
Yet you never agreed with that.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.720
You said,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.039
what binds us
through meeting and parting?

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:56.500
These Double Spring Buckle
worn around the wrist.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.639
Union means coming together,

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:01.879
parting means being apart.

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:05.720
Whether together or separated,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.799
with this pair of buckles,

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:10.240
to me,

00:14:10.679 --> 00:14:12.519
it was a promise to grow old together.

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:25.960
If one day

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:29.519
I were to leave
Tianguang Market for good,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.799
I would hope that at the very least,

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:36.120
I would not forget you.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:40.879
If you do not forget me,

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:42.639
you will be left wondering,

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.100
you will be left longing.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.390
Once obsession takes root,

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.799
the road ahead becomes hard to walk.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.480
Feng.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.000
Promise me this.

00:14:56.039 --> 00:14:58.000
Even if one day we end up far apart,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.960
and have other people by our sides,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.240
as long as we once crossed paths
and walked together,

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.320
there will be no regrets.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.590
This pair of Double Spring Buckles,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.320
I made them especially for you
when I came here.

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:32.240
I

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.440
was wondering
if I could give them to you.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.240
What binds us
through meeting and parting?

00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:16.600
These Double Spring Buckle
worn around the wrist.

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:45.720
Sir, your medicine.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.679
Thank you.

00:16:51.039 --> 00:16:51.639
Let us go.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.639
It seems Yan Rong was right.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.919
The Guangling Residence
wields immense power.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.500
Even if we get out
of the Guangling Residence,

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:02.879
with so many guards at the gates,

00:17:03.039 --> 00:17:04.480
we still cannot leave the city.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.119
In broad daylight, hiding like that

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.559
only makes you stand out more.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.519
Put your hand down.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.440
I am only doing this for everyone.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.119
By the way,

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.279
tell me,

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:20.519
do you think Xia Zelan
will remember Lu Feng?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.279
What do you think?

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.119
I do not know.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.440
Before meeting Granny Xia,

00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:29.440
I hoped she would remember.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.480
Even though we did not
stay long at Tianguang Market,

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:36.200
I could feel what lay between them.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.359
I used to scold Lu Feng
for being unreliable,

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:40.960
but he truly changed.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.839
If those who care for each other
can reunite, that is for the best.

00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:46.880
It is just that...

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.480
Just that never expected Xia Zelan

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.839
to have endured so much on her own,

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:52.060
and to even have a granddaughter.

00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:52.720
Right?

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.200
Grandmother. That is enough already.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.319
Stop working and come eat.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.640
Coming.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.319
You are back.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.079
Granny Xia.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.400
What are you doing?

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.119
Come and eat.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.079
Lan is much better today.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.519
Do not just stand there. Come eat.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.039
That is wonderful.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:14.359
I am starving.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:14.920
Come.

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:16.160
Come.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:16.799
Sit down.

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:19.640
I do not have any fine ingredients here.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.180
I just made do with what I had.

00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:22.920
Eat more, all of you.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.279
This is already very generous.

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:25.759
Here.

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:26.839
Eat.

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.079
Thank you, Grandmother.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.960
You should eat more too.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.440
Grandmother,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.880
your cooking is truly wonderful.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.039
Really?

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.279
That makes me very happy.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.240
Take your time eating.

00:18:59.319 --> 00:19:00.880
I will go get some seasoning.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.839
Eat slowly.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.160
I truly did not expect

00:19:16.359 --> 00:19:17.799
Lan to be in such good spirits today,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.240
and to prepare so many dishes.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:21.000
Yes.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.680
This dish is cooked just right.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.480
Yan Rong, try this.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.359
Thank you.

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:28.039
If only we could eat
Grandmother's cooking every day.

00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:30.559
Did Granny Xia spend the entire day?

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:33.160
Just to prepared this meal for us.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.680
You eat first.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:42.610
I will go check on her.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.559
Lan.

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:00.440
Lan.

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:01.359
What is wrong?

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:02.079
Grandmother.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.240
Grandmother.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.680
Promise me.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.559
You must,

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.279
no matter what,

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:37.880
take Rong,

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.599
and leave.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.920
All right?

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200
Grandmother.

00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:47.000
I promise.

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:53.920
Why

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.319
did you leave before me?

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.559
It took me so long to get here.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.559
I finally found you again.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.799
And now you...

00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:15.880
It is all right.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.839
I

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.880
remember everything now.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.279
At last...

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.440
At last...

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.440
I

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.960
met

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.880
you.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.960
Grandmother.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.519
Grandmother.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.920
Lan.

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:06.240
Xuan.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.519
Zhiyun.

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:12.440
Xuan.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.880
Do not come closer.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.160
Do not come closer.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.480
Stay back.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.920
All these years,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.400
you plotted against Master,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.000
and countless concubines
and their children.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.160
No.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.079
I did not.

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:28.920
Zhixuan.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.119
You were too greedy.

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:33.720
You ruined me,

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:36.839
and you ruined yourself as well.

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:59.000
I heard the authorities reopened
the Guangling Residence case.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.839
Those concubines' children
were all killed by her.

00:25:01.839 --> 00:25:03.680
She even murdered her own sister.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.920
Serves her right.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.599
Move it.

00:25:05.599 --> 00:25:06.400
Right away.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.290
Do not block the road.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.079
What is happening up ahead?

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.200
Mr. Lei.

00:25:12.319 --> 00:25:13.400
It is a peddler's cart.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.400
Watch the rear.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.359
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.519
You.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.279
Get lost.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.480
At once.

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:26.359
Stop.

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:29.960
What are you carrying in that cart?

00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:31.519
Sir..

00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:33.119
Just ordinary goods.

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:41.160
Ordinary goods?

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:46.559
Then why do you smell
of Western Regions incense?

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.599
I travel all over the land.

00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:51.480
It is easy to pick up scents.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.000
Look up.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.480
It is you.

00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:07.799
Stop him.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.839
Stop him.

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:09.640
Hurry.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:10.740
Proceed with the funeral as planned.

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:12.000
Do not delay the hour.

00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:12.559
Yes.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.759
Is Her Highness inside?

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:46.920
What Her Highness?

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.240
You are the one who abducted
Her Highness before.

00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:51.359
You have the wrong person.

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:04.279
Do not move.

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.039
Take this back.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.279
He will not wake up, will he?

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.640
Given his build,

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.780
that dose will keep him out
for a full day and night.

00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:27.079
Still,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.160
three of us against one man

00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:32.519
does feel a little dishonorable.

00:27:35.599 --> 00:27:37.000
This was far too dangerous.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.000
It must not happen again.

00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:39.240
Then the Princess

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.640
should have made it
out of the city safely, right?

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.500
(Lin'an City)

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.980
(Lin'an City)

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.740
(Yashe)

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.559
Boss,

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:08.319
thank you for letting me
see Lan one last time.

00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:12.880
You also helped me recover
what I was looking for.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.480
I owe you my thanks as well.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.130
What do you plan to do next?

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.599
Now that Lan is gone,

00:29:23.119 --> 00:29:24.640
what plans could I possibly have?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.200
I will find a place

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:28.759
and live out the rest of my life
in quiet peace.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.920
In her lifetime,

00:29:32.599 --> 00:29:33.759
being able to see you again

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.519
means she surely left with no regrets.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.680
Yes.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.720
Life lasts only a few short decades.

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:45.200
To have shared a love so unforgettable
means the life was not lived in vain.

00:29:50.079 --> 00:29:51.279
Do not worry.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.120
About what happened this time,

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.240
I will not tell anyone.

00:29:56.079 --> 00:29:57.839
Please take good care
of yourself, Mr. Lu.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.279
Focus on your writing.

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:00.960
Produce more fine work.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.480
Thank you.

00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:16.359
Let's go.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.279
Tuanzi must be
anxiously waiting at home.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.720
Do you think there are really coincidences
in this world?

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:33.039
What do you mean?

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.119
We had just gotten news
about the Kun Blade,

00:30:36.759 --> 00:30:38.519
and Lu Feng showed up right after.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.799
How could that be such a coincidence?

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:42.799
Exactly.

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:44.519
It really is too perfect.

00:30:44.599 --> 00:30:46.480
Yes, far too perfect.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.920
Let me be honest with you.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.400
About Lu Feng, actually...

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.799
Once a coincidence is explained,
it stops being one.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.559
Luckily, nothing bad came of it.

00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:01.700
I will just pretend I know nothing.

00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:06.319
I think you have changed.

00:31:07.319 --> 00:31:07.920
What?

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.920
You are not like you used to be.

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:13.640
Back then, you would never have agreed
to let Lu Feng go to the past with us.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.950
You might even have sent him
straight to Tianguang Market.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.640
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.790
I have no idea what you mean.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.400
Look at you,

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.839
playing dumb now.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.100
Did you learn that from me?

00:31:22.119 --> 00:31:23.400
As if I need to.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.440
No, really, you are much better
like this now.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.000
You are witty and actually warmhearted.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.920
If only you could raise my pay,
that would be perfect.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.240
What?

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.400
I cannot hear you.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.359
What are you doing?

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480
What are you doing?

00:32:06.039 --> 00:32:06.920
I am working out.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.079
After what happened last time,
I finally understood something.

00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:11.000
Without a strong body,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.460
you cannot handle sudden dangers.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.990
That is true.

00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:16.440
Still, you should train more seriously.

00:32:17.799 --> 00:32:18.839
Then what are you doing?

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.039
Me?

00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:24.240
I am enjoying the wind.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.559
Enjoying the wind?

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.680
What is there to enjoy about that?

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.759
Does the future not have wind?

00:32:35.079 --> 00:32:35.759
It does.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.160
But everything there is simulated.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.519
Simulated?

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.440
So with a snap of the fingers,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.400
you can make it snow,

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.279
rain,

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:46.359
or strike lightning?

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:48.480
Yes.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.359
All of it is man-made.

00:32:52.039 --> 00:32:53.400
That sounds impressive,

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.480
but if you live
in something unreal for too long,

00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:58.799
you stop noticing
the value of what is real.

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:01.720
The scent of flowers,

00:33:02.359 --> 00:33:03.200
the soft breeze,

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.759
falling leaves and gentle rain,

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:10.119
only when you truly feel them

00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:13.319
do you realize how beautiful they are.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.079
Recently, a villager uncovered
a pair of uniquely styled jade bracelets

00:33:24.079 --> 00:33:27.000
while digging on his own homestead.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.200
He immediately
contacted the authorities.

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:31.160
After experts examined the site

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:32.640
and made a preliminary assessment,

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:35.480
the bracelets were dated
to the Qinglong period.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.559
As no large ancient tombs
were found nearby,

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:40.000
the identity of their original owner
remains unknown.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.119
However, their craftsmanship
is extremely rare,

00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:44.519
making this a first-ever discovery
in the area.

00:33:44.839 --> 00:33:47.519
Experts believe the craftsmanship
behind this pair of jade bracelets

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:48.840
would have been nearly impossible

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.990
given the level of industrial technology
at the time.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.440
They can only be described
as masterfully wrought,

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.590
with extraordinary ingenuity.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.880
Some specialists further suggest

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.680
that the bracelets
appeared in this region

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.720
through long-distance commercial trade.

00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:00.359
As for their exact place of origin,

00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:02.920
experts will continue
with follow-up analysis and research.

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:05.359
Next, we bring you a brief update.

00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:12.840
Lan.

00:36:53.159 --> 00:36:53.920
Lan.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.760
Have I been too fragile lately?

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.360
I keep drowning myself in drink.

00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:09.719
I miss you so much.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.760
You still remember me.

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:22.599
That is enough for me.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.119
Since

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.880
you have already returned
to your own world,

00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:32.039
you should live your life well.

00:37:40.159 --> 00:37:40.760
But I…

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.719
Feng.

00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:45.400
I have fulfilled my dream.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.280
I became a chef.

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:51.119
In this lifetime,

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:52.920
I have no regrets.

00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:54.920
And you?

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.079
Have you realized your own aspirations?

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.400
Promise me.

00:38:12.239 --> 00:38:14.079
Live your life with sincerity,

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:15.440
all the way to the end,

00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:18.280
just like I did.

00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:36.239
Lan.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.679
Promise me.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.000
Live your life with sincerity,

00:38:57.159 --> 00:38:58.519
all the way to the end,

00:38:59.159 --> 00:39:00.199
just like I did.
