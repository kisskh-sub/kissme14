Hey, Class 1 is playing dodgeball.
Hurry up.

00:00:32.112 --> 00:00:33.113
Sounds fun.

00:00:33.113 --> 00:00:34.347
Hey, who do you think will win today?

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.034
(Sammin High School 2-1)

00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:29.703
Hey.

00:01:45.018 --> 00:01:46.252
Thank you.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.323
Hey, what's that?

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.396
(Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji.)

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.765
"Min Ji, I like you."

00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:00.734
"From Min Ji?"

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:02.001
What?

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:05.004
Which Min Ji?

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:07.207
(Song Min Ji)

00:02:07.707 --> 00:02:11.544
(Yoon Min Ji)

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:15.014
(Kim Min Ji)

00:02:17.016 --> 00:02:18.318
(Yoon Min Ji, Kim Min Ji, Song Min Ji)

00:02:19.018 --> 00:02:21.921
(Min Ji, Min Ji, Min Ji)

00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:23.757
But all three said it wasn't them?

00:02:23.757 --> 00:02:24.657
Yes, sir.

00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.427
So someone here is lying.

00:02:27.427 --> 00:02:29.095
We need to do handwriting analysis...

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:31.264
and identify the culprit.

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:32.766
Don't be ridiculous.

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:34.000
Hyun Woo.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.669
If you studied that hard,
you'd get into Seoul National University.

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.538
Sir.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.273
Forget it.

00:02:40.573 --> 00:02:42.175
Second period is electives, right?

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:43.510
Yes.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.644
All right, let's go.

00:02:44.644 --> 00:02:45.912
Yes.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.089
Hey, Yoon Min Ji, is that really not you?

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.558
No.

00:02:58.858 --> 00:02:59.692
Really?

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:01.661
It wasn't me either.

00:03:02.462 --> 00:03:03.730
Then you wrote it, Kim Min Ji, didn't you?

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:07.367
It wasn't me either.

00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:11.037
Maybe someone was just messing around.

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:12.672
Is that so?

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:15.175
Just be honest
and say you wrote it because you like me.

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.711
Hey, class will start soon.
Get back to your seat.

00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.546
Why? Are you nervous?

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:20.914
You're nervous, right?

00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:22.015
No, I'm not nervous.

00:03:22.282 --> 00:03:24.551
- Not at all.
- You are, aren't you?

00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:26.086
You're nervous.

00:03:26.786 --> 00:03:27.787
I'm really not.

00:03:29.122 --> 00:03:30.090
Stop lying.

00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:36.863
I'm home.

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:38.798
How was school?

00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:47.440
What's going on?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.486
Why did I write that there?

00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:32.285
They said it'd come off with liniment.
Why won't it come off?

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:37.590
Why did I use a permanent marker?

00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:45.465
(Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji.)

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:49.602
Hey, who did this?

00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:51.071
Did they try to erase it?

00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.706
It's completely smeared.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.475
Why? What is it?

00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:57.010
Looks like someone tried to remove that.

00:04:57.977 --> 00:05:00.213
Really?

00:05:01.247 --> 00:05:02.248
That's funny.

00:05:05.852 --> 00:05:06.686
Kim Min Ji.

00:05:08.488 --> 00:05:09.823
It really wasn't you, right?

00:05:10.957 --> 00:05:13.660
I told you it wasn't me.
How many times do I have to say it?

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.863
Fine. Don't shout.

00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:21.901
I mean, it's got to be
either Song Min Ji or Yoon Min Ji.

00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:24.404
I see.

00:05:24.404 --> 00:05:27.340
There was something going on between them
ever since they were class and vice pres.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.875
You know me. I've got good instincts.

00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:34.614
- Really?
- Who likes who?

00:05:34.614 --> 00:05:35.849
Song likes Yoon, probably.

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.117
No way.

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:38.852
It was Yoon who wrote it to Song,
I'm telling you.

00:05:38.852 --> 00:05:41.554
Song's super popular with the guys
because she's pretty.

00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:43.723
Yeah, that makes the most sense.

00:05:43.723 --> 00:05:45.792
- They do look good together, though.
- Right.

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:46.960
What if they're already dating?

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.994
Already?

00:05:49.462 --> 00:05:52.499
Song Min Ji totally looks
like the lead in a teen romance.

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:53.366
Exactly.

00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:56.469
It's Smart Min Ji and Pretty Min Ji.
This is straight out of a web novel.

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.105
Then what about Kim Min Ji? "Friend 1?"

00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:01.508
Hey, she's out of the picture.

00:06:03.676 --> 00:06:06.212
- It's obviously Yoon Min Ji.
- It's Song Min Ji, for sure.

00:06:06.212 --> 00:06:07.814
Let's bet.

00:06:07.814 --> 00:06:09.549
Okay, ice cream bet?

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:10.683
- Deal.
- Okay.

00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:11.918
- Song Min Ji, raise your hand.
- Me.

00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:13.019
Then three of us vote for Song Min Ji.

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:14.521
- Two for Yoon Min Ji.
- Yoon Min Ji.

00:06:14.754 --> 00:06:17.357
But Kim Min Ji...

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:20.260
No one, right?

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.428
Who's that?

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:22.562
Hey.

00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:24.597
- That's harsh.
- Just kidding.

00:06:25.865 --> 00:06:28.134
- She's not here, right?
- Get out.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:33.807
Yeah.

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:36.976
The handsome and smart
class president Yoon Min Ji...

00:06:36.976 --> 00:06:40.847
and the pretty and kind
vice president Song Min Ji...

00:06:40.847 --> 00:06:41.915
do look perfect together.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.150
Not smart,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.786
not even pretty,
and just ordinary Kim Min Ji is...

00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:48.154
Min Ji.

00:06:48.788 --> 00:06:50.990
Min Ji, do you want to eat lunch with me?

00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:53.126
Everyone else is going to the snack bar.

00:06:54.094 --> 00:06:55.161
Okay.

00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:56.096
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:06:56.096 --> 00:06:58.798
Yes! I'm having lunch with Min Ji.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.335
- Isn't that Song Min Ji?
- Her?

00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:03.203
Yeah.

00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:07.207
How far has that doodle story spread?

00:07:07.207 --> 00:07:09.509
Everyone keeps asking you
if you wrote it too, right?

00:07:10.977 --> 00:07:13.947
No, they don't ask me.

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:15.648
Really? Why not?

00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:20.553
So that's why you kept
getting called out today.

00:07:20.553 --> 00:07:22.088
But it really wasn't me.

00:07:22.555 --> 00:07:26.059
I think people are making a bigger deal
because Yoon Min Ji is popular.

00:07:26.393 --> 00:07:27.327
Him?

00:07:28.194 --> 00:07:31.898
He's popular?

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.367
I see.

00:07:35.402 --> 00:07:37.771
You didn't know?
He's been popular since elementary school.

00:07:39.372 --> 00:07:40.473
Really?

00:07:41.307 --> 00:07:43.576
I see. Why though?

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.813
Well, he looks decent, gets good grades,

00:07:46.813 --> 00:07:47.981
and he's good at sports.

00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:50.650
And also, people say he smells nice.

00:07:53.386 --> 00:07:54.421
I see.

00:07:55.755 --> 00:07:56.589
Okay.

00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:17.310
Hey, Kim Min Ji.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.211
Yeah?

00:08:18.978 --> 00:08:19.846
Me?

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.381
Why?

00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:22.916
That doodle.

00:08:24.217 --> 00:08:25.151
Did you write it?

00:08:25.552 --> 00:08:26.486
No.

00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:30.657
I said it wasn't me.

00:08:32.492 --> 00:08:35.195
Why do you think it's me?
This is ridiculous.

00:08:36.062 --> 00:08:36.996
Really?

00:08:38.098 --> 00:08:39.366
And you.

00:08:39.632 --> 00:08:41.601
Ease up on the cologne.

00:08:42.235 --> 00:08:44.137
What kind of student wears
that much cologne?

00:08:44.137 --> 00:08:45.105
How arrogant.

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:47.607
Cologne?

00:08:50.243 --> 00:08:51.544
It's fabric softener.

00:08:57.283 --> 00:08:58.318
Ease up on that.

00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:00.053
It's not good for you.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.521
Well,

00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:03.523
okay.

00:09:04.324 --> 00:09:05.458
I'll tell my mom.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.594
Bye.

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:10.663
Hey, wait...

00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:23.843
(Talk GPT,
What do you think of the name Kim Min Ji?)

00:09:24.244 --> 00:09:28.882
(The name Kim Min Ji
is a very common Korean name.)

00:09:28.882 --> 00:09:30.350
Common...

00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:34.220
Common...

00:09:36.523 --> 00:09:37.590
Mom.

00:09:38.324 --> 00:09:39.159
Yeah?

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.728
Why did you name me Min Ji?

00:09:44.597 --> 00:09:46.066
The name consultant recommended it.

00:09:47.167 --> 00:09:50.236
Didn't you have another name?
Something more unique?

00:09:50.236 --> 00:09:53.006
If a name's too unique,
it's uncomfortable.

00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:55.975
Simple is better.

00:09:58.278 --> 00:09:59.646
I want to change my name.

00:10:01.715 --> 00:10:03.083
Why all of a sudden?

00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:04.184
Just.

00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:07.654
I want at least my name to be special.

00:10:20.734 --> 00:10:23.103
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:25.572
All right, open your books to page 12.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.078
(Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji.)

00:10:32.278 --> 00:10:33.847
You still haven't caught the culprit?

00:10:33.847 --> 00:10:36.516
You're curious too, aren't you?

00:10:36.516 --> 00:10:38.385
All three still say it wasn't them, sir.

00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:40.587
Then some other kid
must've been fooling around.

00:10:40.587 --> 00:10:41.521
What are you talking about?

00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:43.790
We said it wasn't us either.
Do a forensic investigation.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.426
Yeah, do it.
That handwriting analysis thing.

00:10:46.426 --> 00:10:47.494
Okay.

00:10:47.494 --> 00:10:50.196
Sir, we made an ice cream bet.
Do you want in?

00:10:50.196 --> 00:10:52.132
A bet? Keep it among yourselves.

00:10:52.132 --> 00:10:53.466
Who did you bet on?

00:10:54.034 --> 00:10:56.069
Me? I picked Song Min Ji.

00:10:56.703 --> 00:10:58.171
Including me, seven picked Song.

00:10:58.171 --> 00:10:59.072
That doodle.

00:10:59.906 --> 00:11:00.940
I wrote it.

00:11:03.443 --> 00:11:04.310
What?

00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:05.845
Wait a minute.

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:08.415
Then the Min Ji you like is...

00:11:09.282 --> 00:11:10.216
Song?

00:11:11.818 --> 00:11:14.721
Knock it off.

00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:15.688
What's going on here?

00:11:16.489 --> 00:11:19.359
All right, quiet. That's enough.

00:11:19.359 --> 00:11:22.328
Calm down, guys,
and deal with the rest yourselves.

00:11:22.862 --> 00:11:24.964
Let's get back to class. Page 12.

00:11:24.964 --> 00:11:27.400
"Until the peonies bloom..."
Hey, flowers bloomed here too.

00:11:28.134 --> 00:11:29.369
No.

00:11:29.369 --> 00:11:32.539
Let's read together.
"Until the peonies bloom," one, two.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.076
Until the peonies bloom,

00:11:36.076 --> 00:11:40.146
I will still be waiting for my spring.

00:11:49.723 --> 00:11:52.892
Why would he tell a lie like that?

00:11:54.327 --> 00:11:55.295
Hey, Yoon Min Ji.

00:11:55.628 --> 00:11:57.864
Our sixth-grade class is meeting up today.
Do you want to come?

00:11:58.331 --> 00:11:59.833
Are you going?

00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:00.934
Yeah, I am.

00:12:03.336 --> 00:12:04.337
Okay, then.

00:12:04.337 --> 00:12:05.205
Okay.

00:12:10.377 --> 00:12:14.080
Is he really trying to get close
to Min Ji?

00:12:15.582 --> 00:12:16.416
Darn it.

00:12:25.692 --> 00:12:26.993
Should I ask why he did that?

00:12:29.195 --> 00:12:30.964
But we're not even that close.

00:12:46.246 --> 00:12:47.147
Min Ji.

00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:49.082
You should get some rest.

00:12:51.684 --> 00:12:52.619
Sorry.

00:12:52.852 --> 00:12:53.686
It's okay.

00:12:53.686 --> 00:12:56.389
- Hey, you're with me.
- What?

00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:57.824
- Just do it.
- Do what?

00:12:57.824 --> 00:12:58.658
Come on.

00:13:19.446 --> 00:13:20.680
Are you okay?

00:13:21.648 --> 00:13:22.716
Thanks.

00:13:24.317 --> 00:13:25.218
Yeah.

00:13:26.453 --> 00:13:28.455
Hey, watch where you throw the ball.

00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:30.990
- Do you want some help?
- Me?

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:33.860
I'm fine.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.462
Hold your hands out.

00:13:36.563 --> 00:13:37.731
No, I'm okay.

00:13:37.731 --> 00:13:38.965
No, you're not.

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:43.303
Stand with your feet a little wider
than your shoulders,

00:13:44.137 --> 00:13:47.707
and when the ball comes,
think of meeting it.

00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:49.609
I really am fine.

00:13:49.609 --> 00:13:50.977
So put your hand here...

00:13:52.312 --> 00:13:54.147
- like this.
- Okay.

00:13:55.882 --> 00:13:57.016
I'll try it myself.

00:13:57.584 --> 00:13:59.619
Okay.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.492
No, not like that.

00:14:05.492 --> 00:14:07.961
When the ball comes, catch it with...

00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:09.329
No, it's okay, I've got it.

00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:36.222
I'm really fine.
You didn't have to follow me here.

00:14:37.257 --> 00:14:38.391
I felt bad.

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:41.961
Liar. You just wanted to skip class.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.165
You got me.

00:14:49.803 --> 00:14:50.670
Hey.

00:14:51.237 --> 00:14:52.072
Yeah?

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:54.908
Well, you know...

00:14:56.176 --> 00:14:59.713
I eased up on the fabric softener.

00:14:59.713 --> 00:15:00.647
The smell...

00:15:01.948 --> 00:15:02.982
No.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.019
That's not it.

00:15:06.686 --> 00:15:07.520
Then?

00:15:10.957 --> 00:15:12.792
The doodle.

00:15:13.827 --> 00:15:16.563
Did you really write it?

00:15:19.466 --> 00:15:20.767
That.

00:15:23.803 --> 00:15:25.905
Everyone was making
such a big deal out of it,

00:15:26.239 --> 00:15:27.874
so I just said that
because it was annoying.

00:15:29.609 --> 00:15:30.677
I see.

00:15:31.411 --> 00:15:32.679
Okay.

00:15:33.747 --> 00:15:34.714
I thought...

00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:37.484
You thought...

00:15:38.718 --> 00:15:39.819
what?

00:15:43.156 --> 00:15:45.558
That you liked Min Ji.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.495
Really?

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:54.234
I think I will.

00:15:56.736 --> 00:15:57.604
What?

00:15:57.837 --> 00:16:00.473
I think I might actually
start liking her after this.

00:16:06.713 --> 00:16:07.680
I see.

00:16:09.716 --> 00:16:12.619
Really?

00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:16.056
So that's why you lied.

00:16:16.056 --> 00:16:18.124
I see.

00:16:18.124 --> 00:16:19.059
That makes sense.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.029
You two really look good together.

00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:30.136
The bell rang. I should go.

00:16:30.503 --> 00:16:31.337
No...

00:16:51.524 --> 00:16:54.694
All right, who wants to come up
and solve these two problems?

00:16:58.631 --> 00:16:59.566
No one?

00:17:00.734 --> 00:17:03.903
Then let's have the Min Jis come up
and solve them.

00:17:04.938 --> 00:17:05.972
Yes.

00:17:09.376 --> 00:17:11.177
No, not you, Kim Min Ji.

00:17:11.177 --> 00:17:12.545
The class president
and vice president Min Jis.

00:17:24.357 --> 00:17:25.291
Why?

00:17:26.426 --> 00:17:27.994
Why not me?

00:17:29.729 --> 00:17:30.430
What?

00:17:32.732 --> 00:17:34.901
Why does everyone keep saying it's not me?

00:17:36.136 --> 00:17:38.171
You call them
Smart Min Ji and Pretty Min Ji.

00:17:38.171 --> 00:17:39.305
But why am I...

00:17:40.573 --> 00:17:41.908
just Kim Min Ji?

00:17:43.476 --> 00:17:46.413
Why do you all act
like I don't even exist?

00:17:48.481 --> 00:17:50.650
Why do you act the same too, ma'am?

00:18:12.772 --> 00:18:14.207
(Sammin 2nd Year, Class 1)

00:18:14.207 --> 00:18:15.575
(@KimMinJi I have something to say.)

00:18:15.742 --> 00:18:18.144
Crying Min Ji, I'm sorry.

00:18:18.144 --> 00:18:20.814
I'll never call you Kim Min Ji again.

00:18:20.814 --> 00:18:24.017
Yeah, Crybaby Min Ji, sorry.

00:18:24.017 --> 00:18:27.187
Guys, stop joking
and let's actually decide on one.

00:18:27.187 --> 00:18:28.888
How about Our Min Ji?

00:18:28.888 --> 00:18:30.390
Peerless Beauty Min Ji.

00:18:37.397 --> 00:18:39.699
Why did I cry there?

00:18:40.367 --> 00:18:42.268
- Who's crying?
- What?

00:18:44.037 --> 00:18:46.072
Nobody.

00:18:46.072 --> 00:18:48.775
Right. About changing your name.

00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:50.443
Did you decide on a name?

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:51.745
Yeah.

00:18:52.078 --> 00:18:53.813
Well, I've got two.
Tell me what you think.

00:18:54.748 --> 00:18:57.384
Option one is Yeon Woo.

00:18:57.384 --> 00:18:58.518
Yeon Woo.

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:02.489
Why are you here alone?
You should be with me.

00:19:07.527 --> 00:19:10.630
Yeon Woo and Eun Woo
are pretty common these days, right?

00:19:11.197 --> 00:19:13.867
Yeah. You said you hate common names.

00:19:14.768 --> 00:19:16.736
And you said unique ones
are uncomfortable.

00:19:17.837 --> 00:19:19.205
- Then,
- Yeah.

00:19:19.205 --> 00:19:20.206
option two is...

00:19:21.808 --> 00:19:24.377
Yu Ju. What do you think? Pretty, right?

00:19:25.412 --> 00:19:27.781
Ms. Han Yu Ju, come here.

00:19:28.014 --> 00:19:28.848
Yes.

00:19:33.586 --> 00:19:34.454
Right.

00:19:35.255 --> 00:19:36.389
Kim...

00:19:37.757 --> 00:19:40.326
Ye Ppi. How about this?

00:19:48.501 --> 00:19:50.870
Mom, I'm being serious right now.

00:19:52.472 --> 00:19:56.242
I think the problem isn't the name.

00:20:01.614 --> 00:20:04.617
Min Ji, watch the vlog I just uploaded.

00:20:04.617 --> 00:20:05.618
You have to watch it.

00:20:11.024 --> 00:20:12.792
Why should I watch this?

00:20:12.792 --> 00:20:14.494
(Min Ji iamMINZI)

00:20:18.064 --> 00:20:18.898
Ta-da.

00:20:19.632 --> 00:20:22.035
It's been a while
since I wore a school uniform, right?

00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:26.706
I'm on my way to meet my classmates
from sixth-grade after ages.

00:20:26.706 --> 00:20:28.508
There's another friend
in my current class...

00:20:28.508 --> 00:20:30.744
who was also in the same class back then.
He's Yoon Min Ji.

00:20:30.744 --> 00:20:34.114
So now, with him
and two other girl friends...

00:20:34.114 --> 00:20:35.315
Do we really need to add this?

00:20:35.315 --> 00:20:36.683
Yeah, because I like it.

00:20:36.683 --> 00:20:37.717
Why?

00:20:37.717 --> 00:20:39.085
It's kind of cute.

00:20:39.285 --> 00:20:40.687
Hey, are you guys still not done?

00:20:40.687 --> 00:20:41.654
Why are you laughing?

00:20:42.922 --> 00:20:44.691
What are you doing after this is over?

00:20:44.691 --> 00:20:46.226
- What should we do?
- Take photos?

00:20:46.226 --> 00:20:47.260
Let's take photos.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.595
What's your MBTI?

00:20:48.595 --> 00:20:50.864
- ISFJ?
- You were a J type?

00:20:50.864 --> 00:20:51.998
I want to go up there.

00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:54.501
Come a little closer.

00:20:54.501 --> 00:20:56.036
Good. This looks nice.

00:20:58.204 --> 00:20:59.072
Yeah.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.341
They look good together.

00:21:02.642 --> 00:21:04.010
You two look good together.

00:21:04.711 --> 00:21:05.779
Satisfied?

00:21:05.779 --> 00:21:07.447
I don't want to leave.

00:21:07.447 --> 00:21:09.315
Right.
Yoon Min Ji, I have something to ask.

00:21:09.315 --> 00:21:10.917
Everyone, focus on Min Ji.

00:21:10.917 --> 00:21:12.118
- What is it?
- What is it?

00:21:12.118 --> 00:21:13.353
- Min Ji?
- Min Ji?

00:21:13.353 --> 00:21:14.454
All right.

00:21:14.454 --> 00:21:15.755
Yoon Min Ji.

00:21:15.755 --> 00:21:17.724
Is it true that you have a crush on me?

00:21:18.124 --> 00:21:19.492
What? No way.

00:21:19.492 --> 00:21:20.760
No way. This is ridiculous.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.896
Hey, stop it. Don't film.

00:21:22.896 --> 00:21:26.232
Didn't you say you wrote
"Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji?"

00:21:30.203 --> 00:21:31.304
I don't want to watch.

00:21:47.187 --> 00:21:48.154
You're early.

00:21:49.756 --> 00:21:50.623
Yeah.

00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:53.793
I'm on duty this week.

00:21:54.961 --> 00:21:56.296
You're early too.

00:21:58.932 --> 00:21:59.599
Yeah.

00:22:03.837 --> 00:22:07.407
I always come early. Every day.

00:22:08.975 --> 00:22:11.277
That's impressive.

00:22:41.841 --> 00:22:43.810
Do you watch Song Min Ji's vlogs?

00:22:46.513 --> 00:22:47.580
Sometimes.

00:22:49.282 --> 00:22:52.652
Did you see the one uploaded yesterday?

00:22:58.992 --> 00:22:59.859
Yeah.

00:23:03.963 --> 00:23:04.898
That's it?

00:23:07.767 --> 00:23:08.568
What is?

00:23:09.502 --> 00:23:11.171
Yoon Min Ji.

00:23:15.675 --> 00:23:18.144
You little punk. I watched the vlog.

00:23:19.546 --> 00:23:20.580
What happened?

00:23:20.847 --> 00:23:22.182
Did you confess properly?

00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:25.585
What are you talking about?

00:23:28.455 --> 00:23:31.124
All of you guys watched my vlog.

00:23:31.124 --> 00:23:32.959
So why didn't you guys hit like?

00:23:32.959 --> 00:23:34.060
Because we're jealous.

00:23:36.429 --> 00:23:38.498
So? Are the two dating?

00:23:39.966 --> 00:23:41.201
Who knows.

00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:43.236
What, is it an open ending?

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.071
Hey, what is it? Tell me.

00:23:45.071 --> 00:23:46.940
The bell rang, guys.

00:23:50.677 --> 00:23:52.679
Let's start class. Page 7.

00:24:11.664 --> 00:24:12.499
What are you doing?

00:24:13.967 --> 00:24:14.801
Nothing.

00:24:15.802 --> 00:24:16.669
Here.

00:24:17.704 --> 00:24:19.773
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

00:24:21.474 --> 00:24:22.308
Min Ji.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.513
Should I set the vlog to private?

00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:28.848
Why?

00:24:29.315 --> 00:24:32.285
You don't look like you're in a good mood,

00:24:33.253 --> 00:24:35.255
and you cried back then too.

00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:40.260
Actually,

00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:42.195
I'm...

00:24:42.796 --> 00:24:45.799
jealous of you and Yoon Min Ji.

00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:47.567
Really? Why?

00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:50.603
You two feel like special Min Jis,

00:24:51.337 --> 00:24:53.873
but I don't think I am.

00:24:54.407 --> 00:24:56.910
It feels natural that everyone...

00:24:57.811 --> 00:24:59.212
just overlooks me.

00:24:59.746 --> 00:25:00.680
Hey.

00:25:01.548 --> 00:25:05.585
Min Ji, you've never wanted
to change your name before, have you?

00:25:06.386 --> 00:25:07.887
Of course, I have.

00:25:07.887 --> 00:25:08.755
Did you know?

00:25:08.755 --> 00:25:11.024
In middle school,
my nickname was "Bad Min Ji."

00:25:12.392 --> 00:25:13.293
Why?

00:25:13.293 --> 00:25:16.563
There was another Min Ji in my class
who was super pretty...

00:25:16.563 --> 00:25:17.797
and really kind too.

00:25:17.797 --> 00:25:19.999
So I suddenly became Bad Min Ji.

00:25:20.867 --> 00:25:21.701
That's ridiculous.

00:25:24.738 --> 00:25:26.406
If I go to college,

00:25:26.406 --> 00:25:28.842
and there's an even prettier Min Ji,
what will they call me then?

00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:32.812
So Min Ji,

00:25:34.013 --> 00:25:37.350
no matter what people call us,
let's not care.

00:25:41.688 --> 00:25:42.756
And...

00:25:43.456 --> 00:25:46.326
to at least one person, you're definitely
a special Min Ji right now.

00:25:47.494 --> 00:25:49.162
Who? My mom?

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.365
You didn't watch my vlog, did you?

00:25:52.665 --> 00:25:53.533
I did.

00:25:56.403 --> 00:25:57.437
I watched it,

00:25:58.338 --> 00:26:00.740
but I didn't finish it.

00:26:01.808 --> 00:26:02.642
I'll watch it.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.111
Make sure you like.

00:26:05.378 --> 00:26:06.212
Okay.

00:26:06.579 --> 00:26:07.480
I'll go now.

00:26:08.248 --> 00:26:09.182
Thanks.

00:26:23.963 --> 00:26:25.565
Everyone, focus on Min Ji.

00:26:25.565 --> 00:26:26.733
- What is it?
- What is it?

00:26:26.733 --> 00:26:27.967
- Min Ji? Why?
- Min Ji?

00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:29.135
All right.

00:26:29.135 --> 00:26:30.370
Yoon Min Ji.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.338
Is it true that you have a crush on me?

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.475
- No way.
- No way. That's ridiculous.

00:26:35.475 --> 00:26:37.510
Hey, stop it. Don't film.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.247
Didn't you say you wrote
"Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji?"

00:26:41.247 --> 00:26:43.183
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:47.187
Why do you think
that Min Ji has to be you?

00:26:47.721 --> 00:26:49.089
What?

00:26:49.089 --> 00:26:50.023
What are you talking about?

00:26:51.157 --> 00:26:52.759
You like Kim Min Ji, don't you?

00:26:53.393 --> 00:26:54.327
Who is Kim Min Ji?

00:26:54.327 --> 00:26:56.496
Guys, there's another Min Ji in our class.

00:26:56.496 --> 00:26:57.397
What are you talking about?

00:26:58.565 --> 00:27:00.233
You like Kim Min Ji, don't you?

00:27:01.701 --> 00:27:04.270
Why do you think
that Min Ji has to be you?

00:27:10.744 --> 00:27:13.213
But he said
he might start liking Min Ji...

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.389
I thought you liked Min Ji.

00:27:23.223 --> 00:27:24.157
I see.

00:27:29.496 --> 00:27:30.930
I think I will.

00:27:32.432 --> 00:27:33.333
What?

00:27:36.069 --> 00:27:38.571
I think I might actually
start liking her after this.

00:27:39.773 --> 00:27:42.242
I always come early. Every day.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.881
They said it comes off with liniment.
Why won't it come off?

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:27.353
What are you doing here alone?

00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:29.122
Why?

00:28:31.357 --> 00:28:32.192
Why?

00:28:34.728 --> 00:28:36.329
What are you doing here?

00:28:36.496 --> 00:28:38.765
I was heading to the classroom.

00:28:40.133 --> 00:28:42.135
The bell's about to ring.
Aren't you going in?

00:28:45.805 --> 00:28:46.639
I am.

00:28:48.641 --> 00:28:50.543
I'll go first.

00:28:54.814 --> 00:28:56.383
That doodle. It was me.

00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:07.227
Really?

00:29:08.595 --> 00:29:09.429
I didn't know.

00:29:11.297 --> 00:29:13.066
You already knew everything.

00:29:15.235 --> 00:29:17.537
Well, I only saw you trying to erase it.

00:29:18.872 --> 00:29:20.473
- What?
- Then...

00:29:20.974 --> 00:29:24.110
which Min Ji do you like?

00:29:28.548 --> 00:29:31.651
That Min Ji might not be me, that's why.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:34.988
Tell me.

00:29:37.757 --> 00:29:39.259
If you've got nothing else to say,

00:29:40.293 --> 00:29:41.127
I'm going.

00:29:54.374 --> 00:29:55.275
It's you.

00:30:03.583 --> 00:30:05.385
By the way, that doodle.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.755
You were erasing it so seriously.

00:30:08.755 --> 00:30:10.790
You were desperately trying to erase it.

00:30:12.025 --> 00:30:15.595
And you said Song Min Ji
and I looked good together,

00:30:16.696 --> 00:30:18.531
and what else did you say?

00:30:19.065 --> 00:30:20.233
That I have a crush.

00:30:35.815 --> 00:30:36.750
Who...

00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:39.219
do you like?

00:30:44.758 --> 00:30:46.693
I like you, Yoon Min Ji.

00:30:51.297 --> 00:30:52.232
Kim Min Ji likes me?

00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:03.243
Call me.

00:31:06.046 --> 00:31:06.880
Why?

00:31:08.314 --> 00:31:09.382
Just call me.

00:31:19.292 --> 00:31:21.394
(Cute Min Ji)

00:31:45.552 --> 00:31:46.486
Min Ji.

00:31:47.087 --> 00:31:48.021
I like you.

00:31:48.421 --> 00:31:49.355
From. Min Ji.

00:32:13.065 --> 00:32:15.490
(Min Ji, Min Ji, Min Ji)

00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:17.006
