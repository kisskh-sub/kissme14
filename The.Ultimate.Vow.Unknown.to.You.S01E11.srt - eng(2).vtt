00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.549
Am I

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.948
a demon to you?

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:18.750
Are you not?

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.509
If

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.789
you're determined to see me as one,

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:43.470
then I'll be a demon.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.182
Kill me or punish me

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.950
as you wish.

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:51.909
Cui Di isn't dead.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.149
But her life

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.789
is in your hands.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.870
If you take your own life,

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:59.830
I'll make her die with you.

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:02.629
Don't touch her.

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:04.445
Despicable.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.389
Your Highness.

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:34.349
What is it?

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.550
You asked me to investigate
the massacre of Young Lady Shen's family.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.109
We've found something.

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:51.829
Heng Dao,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.430
I need to see someone.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.349
Your Reverence,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.949
please grant me a medicine.

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.069
Everything in this world
follows cause and effect.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.345
You're asking for

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.139
the Oblivion Powder?

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.509
Yes.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.470
I want a medicine
that makes one forget pain.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:16.990
Be it pain

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.629
or joy,

00:03:19.337 --> 00:03:22.099
they are trials given by Heaven.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.781
But I can't bear to see her suffer.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.069
I'd rather

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.269
she forget everything.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.710
Have you ever considered this?

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.949
What you call forgetting

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.069
is taking away her life.

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.750
I just don't want her to hate me.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.789
In one's life,

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.795
joy, sorrow, reunion, and parting

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.430
are all bound by fate.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.270
To forcefully erase her memories

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.470
is to sever her karmic ties.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.629
Please, Your Reverence.

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.549
This medicine will erase all her pain.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.829
Only the most beautiful moments

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.270
will remain.

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.270
But do you know

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:10.789
your desire

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.429
for brief comfort

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.920
goes against

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.949
Heaven?

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.870
The law of cause and effect

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.628
will bring its retribution.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:22.269
Even if it leads to endless ruin,

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.149
I'd still do it without regret.

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.109
Poor foolish child.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.407
Poor foolish child.

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.995
Love is the most hurtful thing of all.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.870
Of all the world,
what is it that which they call love?

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.069
To pledge to each other
their life and soul?

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.708
Oh, merciful Buddha.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:45.549
Your Highness,

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.629
Young Lady Shen hasn't eaten all day.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:49.989
I'll take care of her.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.670
Yes.

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:52.230
Where is Cui Di?

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.407
If you don't eat,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.382
Cui Di will have to starve with you.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.820
If you starve for one day,

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:00.509
she starves for one day.

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:02.550
If you seek death,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.557
she'll die with you.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.190
Get a good rest.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.190
If you want her to suffer less,

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:44.350
there are things

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:46.870
you must never bring up again.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.469
I understand.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:55.709
Her life

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:58.469
depends on a single thought of yours.

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:13.829
Ru.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.469
There, there.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.509
Don't be afraid.

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:02.269
You're just ill.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.029
If you have proper rest,

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.350
you'll recover.

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:16.350
Who did this

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.790
to you?

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:20.910
The wound is so deep down to the bone.

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:23.709
If you don't believe me,
I can carve my heart out for you.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.110
Fine. Go ahead.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.750
You should just die.

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:43.220
I want to watch you fall into hell.

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:45.029
Scars will heal.

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:47.469
As long as you stay by my side,

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.389
this pain means nothing.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.708
From now on,

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:52.829
let's live well together, all right?

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.629
Che, does it really not hurt?

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.550
I'll blow on it for you.
