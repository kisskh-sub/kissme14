00:38.206 --> 00:39.344
You can do this.

00:40.551 --> 00:41.655
You can do this.

00:46.931 --> 00:49.172
This is the oldest you've ever
been,

00:50.137 --> 00:51.827
and you'll never be this young
again.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.241
You're going on in one minute.

01:58.344 --> 01:59.689
Better shake your ass, girl.

02:46.310 --> 02:47.793
Welcome to Risqué!

02:48.827 --> 02:50.241
Feeling Swollen?

02:50.689 --> 02:52.586
Remember, Tuesday's two-for-one

02:53.000 --> 02:54.482
complimentary lap dances.

03:16.068 --> 03:16.931
Hey, baby.

03:19.586 --> 03:21.241
- Hey there, Jess.
- Hey, Pete.

03:21.724 --> 03:23.931
- Another day another dollar,
right? -You know it, hon.

03:56.137 --> 03:59.689
<i>Welcoming to the stage,</i>
<i>Risqué's queen bee,</i>

04:00.275 --> 04:01.448
<i>Jessica.</i>

04:18.275 --> 04:19.896
Hey, can I get a whiskey sour?

04:34.965 --> 04:38.103
- Hey, you got my beers?
- Hey! Yeah, of course.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.413
So, how is?

05:40.827 --> 05:42.689
Still looking fucking sexy,
Jess.

05:43.448 --> 05:44.344
Still?

05:45.137 --> 05:47.241
Really? Fuck off, Billy.

05:47.724 --> 05:50.275
I'm just sayin', for an O.G.
veteran like yourself,

05:50.793 --> 05:51.862
you're still hot as shit.

05:52.241 --> 05:53.344
It's a compliment.

05:53.689 --> 05:54.896
Gotta take it as such.

05:56.551 --> 05:58.068
If your Uncle didn't own this
joint

05:58.172 --> 06:00.793
and kept you employed
out of some sad sense of pity,

06:00.896 --> 06:03.620
God knows what freeway overpass
you'd be living under.

06:04.241 --> 06:06.172
Okay, nasty. Very nasty.

06:06.275 --> 06:09.379
But? I'm a key piece
of my Uncle's vast operation.

06:09.931 --> 06:11.482
You always misjudge me, Jess.

06:11.896 --> 06:13.862
One day you'll eat
every one of those words.

06:15.379 --> 06:17.344
Highly doubtful.

06:18.137 --> 06:20.448
Okay, well, I'm a mover and
shaker, baby! And?

06:21.896 --> 06:24.103
you're gonna regret not fucking
me when you had the chance.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.103
Now, you've made me nauseous.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.275
Hey, girl, you're late.
Karl was on the prowl for you.

06:31.379 --> 06:32.517
Fuck him.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.448
Just had to stomach
another delusional rant

06:34.551 --> 06:35.689
from Big Boy Billy.

06:37.137 --> 06:38.517
What a fucking loser.

06:39.206 --> 06:40.896
He's a crazy pig.

06:44.034 --> 06:45.344
My God, you did not.

06:45.758 --> 06:47.000
Those shoes, girl.

06:48.344 --> 06:49.724
I can't believe you bought 'em.

06:50.137 --> 06:51.827
I'll go get our drinks,
sweetie.

06:53.896 --> 06:54.896
I did.

06:56.172 --> 06:58.551
And I love 'em. Do you love
'em? You gotta love 'em.

06:58.655 --> 07:00.551
Yeah, I love 'em. How much?

07:00.931 --> 07:03.000
- You don't want to know.
- I gotta know.

07:03.827 --> 07:04.724
Three hundred.

07:06.655 --> 07:10.068
Six hundred? and 50 plus tax.

07:11.655 --> 07:12.862
Okay. You know how we hate

07:12.965 --> 07:15.068
that whole "irresponsible
stripper" stereotype?

07:15.517 --> 07:16.448
Yeah.

07:17.034 --> 07:19.448
You are not really helping to
dispel it.

07:19.724 --> 07:22.344
Dispel it. I don't know what
that means.

07:22.689 --> 07:25.241
But I'm wearin' Louboutins,
<i>chica!</i>

07:31.655 --> 07:33.862
- You know what I was thinking?
- What?

07:34.310 --> 07:36.482
We need to calculate
your birth path number.

07:37.172 --> 07:38.517
I thought we did that last
time.

07:38.620 --> 07:39.689
No, you cunt.

07:39.931 --> 07:41.172
That was your name number.

07:41.275 --> 07:42.482
It's totally different.

07:42.965 --> 07:44.965
Now, we need to add the digits
of your birth date

07:45.068 --> 07:47.413
and then keep reducing
until we reach a final number

07:47.517 --> 07:50.206
- which will be your birth
number. -Sounds confusing.

07:50.689 --> 07:51.793
Well, yeah, it is.

07:52.344 --> 07:54.655
Unless you're trained? and I'm
trained.

07:54.758 --> 07:55.827
So, it's easy.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.000
All right, let's start with
your birthday.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.000
Well, it's?

08:00.586 --> 08:02.103
Shelby, what the fuck?!.

08:02.206 --> 08:03.172
No.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.000
Move Your Ass!

08:05.103 --> 08:06.793
"Eyes Wide Shut" in two minute!

08:06.896 --> 08:08.724
- Already? Shit!
- Let's go.

08:09.034 --> 08:11.103
I don't know how you understand
what the hell she's said.

08:11.206 --> 08:12.137
Yeah, it's a gift.

08:12.517 --> 08:13.586
BRB.

08:13.689 --> 08:14.586
What?

08:16.068 --> 08:17.379
Be right back.

08:17.482 --> 08:18.551
Clever girl.

08:18.655 --> 08:20.379
God, you're such a geezer.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.344
And what century are you living
in, mate?

08:23.551 --> 08:25.034
Missing you already.

08:25.275 --> 08:26.517
Laters.

08:33.379 --> 08:34.793
I see Roger's back.

08:34.896 --> 08:36.241
Yeah, I think he's hot.

08:36.689 --> 08:37.689
No, you don't.

08:37.793 --> 08:38.931
You think his money is hot.

08:39.034 --> 08:41.862
I don't know. I've grown fond
of the silver fox.

08:41.965 --> 08:44.068
What can I say? He is good to
me.

08:44.172 --> 08:46.517
I told you it's a mistake to
date clients.

08:46.620 --> 08:49.586
And the rumor is he's still
married.

08:49.689 --> 08:51.413
And isn't his wife's family

08:51.517 --> 08:52.517
like super connected?

08:52.620 --> 08:54.758
Just buzz. Don't mean it is
true.

08:54.862 --> 08:56.448
Like mafia connected.

08:56.551 --> 08:57.655
Remember <i>Godfather?</i>

08:57.758 --> 08:59.517
James Caan protecting his
sister.

09:01.344 --> 09:02.655
Stay away from that guy

09:02.758 --> 09:04.137
or have bullet in brains.

09:04.517 --> 09:06.689
I keep telling her, but she not
listens.

09:06.793 --> 09:10.413
Guy, brain, listen. There's no
"s", babe.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.448
In brain.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.137
Up ass.

09:13.517 --> 09:14.793
What I give fucks.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.379
All spell dead.

09:16.827 --> 09:18.310
I actually understood some of
that.

09:18.586 --> 09:19.689
<i>Danke!</i>

09:20.068 --> 09:21.206
Learn that from Bianka.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.068
- Who?
- One of the new girls, Bianka.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.758
I think she's German.

09:26.413 --> 09:27.793
I think Hungarian.

09:28.137 --> 09:31.206
Heard she killed two guys
outside of a biker bar in Berlin.

09:35.482 --> 09:36.620
Slit their throat,

09:36.724 --> 09:37.655
ear to ear.

09:37.758 --> 09:39.034
I hear four.

09:45.241 --> 09:47.000
Well, rumor or not, that chick

09:47.103 --> 09:49.689
is clearly one badass bitch.

09:49.793 --> 09:50.862
Just in here.

09:51.310 --> 09:52.379
Jess?

09:53.068 --> 09:54.137
this is Jeanie.

09:54.689 --> 09:55.793
Take her under your wing.

09:56.137 --> 09:59.000
Enlighten her with your many
years of?

09:59.275 --> 10:00.517
stripper wisdom.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.034
Pig.

10:07.310 --> 10:09.862
- Jeanie?
- Yeah, like Jeanie in a bottle.

10:09.965 --> 10:11.517
I make men's wishes come true.

10:14.034 --> 10:15.206
Never say that again.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.275
Okay.

10:17.172 --> 10:19.310
Stay on my heels and take
notes. Okay?

10:19.896 --> 10:21.000
Yes, ma'am.

10:21.275 --> 10:23.206
And don't ever call me ma'am.

10:23.310 --> 10:24.689
- Okay.
- Never.

10:24.793 --> 10:25.758
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:27.551 --> 10:29.448
All right, you horny bastards?

10:30.482 --> 10:34.310
Kubrick himself called it
scintillating.

10:35.413 --> 10:36.689
Give it up for Risqué's

10:36.793 --> 10:38.655
exclusive extravaganza.

10:39.103 --> 10:42.137
Eyes Wide Shut.

11:36.620 --> 11:37.517
Hey, new guy.

11:38.586 --> 11:39.724
Where you from again?

11:39.965 --> 11:42.000
Small town down south,
you probably wouldn't know it.

11:42.103 --> 11:43.482
- Hey, Jeanie?
- I-- I moved around.

11:43.586 --> 11:44.896
Where you been, girl?

11:45.517 --> 11:46.655
All righty.

11:49.241 --> 11:50.241
Hey, sweetie.

11:50.344 --> 11:51.586
I'm Big Boy Billy.

11:51.689 --> 11:53.551
My uncle started Club Risqué

11:53.655 --> 11:54.758
and I'm head of security.

11:54.862 --> 11:57.000
I'm also vice president
of the organization.

11:57.103 --> 12:00.620
I thought Karl owned the place.

12:00.724 --> 12:02.310
No, he's just a manager.

12:02.413 --> 12:03.655
He does like day to day,

12:03.758 --> 12:05.965
but Karl told me
you are one sexy little Jeanie.

12:06.068 --> 12:08.758
You heard right, Big Boy Billy.

12:09.931 --> 12:12.068
Can I-- Can I tell you what I
dream of Jeanie?

12:12.896 --> 12:14.137
Yes, you can.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.862
Billy's a creep looking to fuck
anything that walks through here.

12:18.965 --> 12:20.241
Said he was a V.P.

12:21.172 --> 12:22.206
Yeah, sure.

12:23.586 --> 12:25.586
He sits in his little security
there,

12:25.827 --> 12:28.448
jacking off and pretending
he's the reincarnation

12:28.551 --> 12:30.034
of Hugh fucking Hefner.

12:30.586 --> 12:31.862
First word of advice,

12:32.551 --> 12:33.965
please take this to heart.

12:34.068 --> 12:35.413
- Steer clear.
- Thank you.

12:35.517 --> 12:37.172
Jess, right?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.103
Yeah.

12:40.413 --> 12:41.379
Or Jessica.

12:42.103 --> 12:43.344
Just not Jessie.

12:44.206 --> 12:45.241
I hate Jessie.

12:45.448 --> 12:46.620
Hi, I'm Jeanie.

12:47.275 --> 12:49.689
You want to come joining me and
Shelby in Champagne room?

12:49.793 --> 12:51.620
Couple of coked up high
rollers.

12:51.724 --> 12:53.172
Could be a few good C notes
each.

12:55.758 --> 12:56.965
I like C notes.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.517
Who doesn't, Jessie?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.620
She's so friendly.

13:05.172 --> 13:07.206
Rumor is she killed six guys

13:07.310 --> 13:09.310
outside some biker bar in
Berlin.

13:42.793 --> 13:44.448
Well, now, shake those tits.

13:45.137 --> 13:47.344
Shake it for Tommy and he'll
make it rain.

13:47.724 --> 13:49.413
You want the rain, don't you,
baby?

13:50.344 --> 13:51.551
Sure, sweetie.

13:51.655 --> 13:52.931
Make it rain.

14:01.379 --> 14:03.068
No touching, remember?

14:03.172 --> 14:05.517
Don't get all spikey with me,
baby. Loosen up.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.758
Spikey. I like that.

14:10.137 --> 14:12.172
But this ain't a whore house,
remember?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.068
Could have fooled me.

14:14.931 --> 14:15.896
Oi!

14:16.000 --> 14:17.517
Get off her, you asshole.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.482
That asshole's probably gonna
sue.

14:30.724 --> 14:33.206
- Not probably, will.
- My uncle will not be happy.

14:33.310 --> 14:34.827
Shut the fuck up, Billy.

14:34.931 --> 14:36.655
What happened to the eye in the
sky?

14:36.896 --> 14:39.482
- Where the fuck were you?
- I'll deal with Billy later.

14:39.586 --> 14:41.241
And I'm pretty sure
his uncle won't be happy

14:41.344 --> 14:42.896
to hear he was fucking off
again.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.034
Jessica warned him twice.

14:46.068 --> 14:47.275
He's lucky I was tired.

14:48.413 --> 14:50.517
You two, done for the night. Go
home.

14:52.793 --> 14:54.310
Jess. Not you.

14:54.413 --> 14:55.482
You stay.

14:57.551 --> 14:58.896
Go on. Get the fuck.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.724
All right, twat.

15:02.655 --> 15:03.724
Take a seat.

15:12.896 --> 15:13.862
You're fired, Jess.

15:13.965 --> 15:14.931
What?

15:15.586 --> 15:16.724
You're 38 years old.

15:16.827 --> 15:18.586
You don't drink with the
customers anymore.

15:18.689 --> 15:20.000
Guy touches you, you freak out.

15:20.103 --> 15:21.551
And to be honest,

15:21.655 --> 15:24.379
you don't generate enough
business to justify keeping you here anymore.

15:24.482 --> 15:27.275
Karl, that is bullshit, and you
know it.

15:27.379 --> 15:29.275
I've been here ten years

15:29.379 --> 15:30.448
and I am just as hot

15:30.551 --> 15:33.206
- as any one of those girls out
there. -Come on, Jess.

15:33.310 --> 15:36.344
You're not as hot as those
girls out there. Not anymore.

15:36.448 --> 15:37.965
I mean, how much longer do you
think

15:38.068 --> 15:39.896
you can keep doing this for,
anyway?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.379
As long as I fucking have to.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.827
I'm doing you a fucking favor.

15:43.172 --> 15:44.793
Shit, you could be
half those girls' mother,

15:44.896 --> 15:45.827
for Christ's sakes.

15:45.931 --> 15:46.896
Fuck you.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.206
- Fuck me? Fuck you.
- What?

15:49.310 --> 15:51.482
Like one of those girls
on your massage table.

15:51.586 --> 15:53.344
I hear you're hung
like a fucking light switch.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.379
You always did have
such a big fucking mouth

15:58.482 --> 15:59.551
on you, didn't you?

16:01.275 --> 16:05.344
And you are always an insecure,
narcissistic piece of shit.

16:06.655 --> 16:10.482
And you're a pathetic,
delusional fucking loser.

16:10.586 --> 16:12.103
Get the fuck outta my club,
Jess.

16:12.517 --> 16:13.862
It's not your club,

16:13.965 --> 16:16.137
it's his fucking uncle's club.

16:21.724 --> 16:22.827
Fucking whore.

17:41.793 --> 17:43.241
- Hey, you.
<i>- Thank God.</i>

17:43.344 --> 17:45.862
I've been like freaking out
trying to get a hold of you.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.275
I heard what that cock sucker
did to you last night.

17:48.827 --> 17:51.896
Well, there were several
cocksuckers there last night.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.034
I mean, Karl, <i>the</i>cocksucker.

17:54.275 --> 17:56.517
He probably did me a favor, to
be honest.

17:56.620 --> 17:58.620
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.

17:58.724 --> 18:01.620
Let's go hit some balls
tomorrow over at The Bay Club.

18:01.724 --> 18:03.379
I don't know if I'm up for it,
babe.

18:03.482 --> 18:06.482
Come on. You can pretend
they're Karl's balls.

18:08.103 --> 18:09.413
Well, when you put it that way.

18:09.517 --> 18:10.862
<i>I'll meet you around 3:00.</i>

18:10.965 --> 18:13.172
Perfect. And don't be sad,
okay?

18:13.275 --> 18:14.862
'Cause that's gonna misalign
your chakras.

18:14.965 --> 18:16.034
<i>And nobody wants that.</i>

18:16.137 --> 18:18.172
Everything's gonna be okay.
Trust me.

18:18.827 --> 18:20.000
Love ya.

18:20.482 --> 18:21.448
I love you.

18:28.827 --> 18:30.827
Damn it. Fucker, bastard.

18:31.655 --> 18:32.793
This is hard.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.827
This is not fun. Who thinks
this is fun?

18:36.034 --> 18:37.689
I understood every other word.

18:37.793 --> 18:38.758
She said,

18:38.862 --> 18:40.413
"Damn it. Fucker bastard."

18:40.517 --> 18:42.000
"This is odd. This is not fun."

18:42.103 --> 18:43.689
"Who thinks this is fun?"

18:44.517 --> 18:46.344
Personally, I'm having a blast.

18:48.379 --> 18:49.275
Fore!

18:50.206 --> 18:51.206
Hey!

18:51.448 --> 18:53.241
That's the third club I've
lost.

18:53.344 --> 18:55.827
- Are you sure you're a lefty,
babes? -Who knows?

18:57.758 --> 18:59.103
Babe, I meant to tell you.

18:59.206 --> 19:02.448
I ran your horoscope last night
and it was freaky good.

19:03.034 --> 19:04.000
Hit me.

19:05.034 --> 19:06.517
Major changes lie ahead,

19:06.862 --> 19:08.137
but be aware of the waxing
moon.

19:08.620 --> 19:10.310
Major changes?

19:10.827 --> 19:13.655
It also said you will reconnect
with someone from your past

19:13.758 --> 19:15.655
when Mercury the messenger
turns retrograde

19:15.758 --> 19:18.172
in your eighth house of deep
sharing.

19:18.689 --> 19:20.413
Major change already happened.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.586
Karl, the cocksucker, fired
her.

19:22.793 --> 19:25.206
Someone needs to take that
prick out.

19:25.413 --> 19:27.172
Yeah, but then we'd end up
with Big Boy Billy.

19:27.275 --> 19:29.586
And to be honest with you, I
don't know which prick's worse.

19:29.689 --> 19:31.827
This job makes you more crazy
every day.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.793
Guys grabbing our tits,

19:35.172 --> 19:36.482
slapping our asses.

19:36.793 --> 19:38.034
Reeking of B.O.

19:38.137 --> 19:40.724
- That's what I can't stand.
- So many pricks.

19:41.344 --> 19:42.724
But the money's so good.

19:42.827 --> 19:44.275
Totally addicting.

19:44.379 --> 19:48.103
You keep saying to yourself,
just one more year and I'm out.

19:48.206 --> 19:50.310
Six more months and I'm done.

19:50.517 --> 19:53.862
And suddenly you wake up
and somehow, you're 40.

19:54.379 --> 19:55.655
Who 40?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.034
- Jessica's 40.
- Almost 40.

19:58.137 --> 20:00.310
No. Come on. What?

20:00.724 --> 20:02.896
You don't look it, Jess. You
look hot.

20:04.344 --> 20:05.517
But I feel it.

20:06.724 --> 20:09.551
All the assholes,
I've wasted my life with.

20:10.724 --> 20:13.448
Fifty shitty boyfriends,
two shitty marriages.

20:13.551 --> 20:15.827
I should have a million dollars
in a bank account by now.

20:15.931 --> 20:17.758
And somehow, I have almost
nothing to show

20:17.862 --> 20:19.620
for 20 years of shaking my ass

20:19.724 --> 20:22.482
in front of those sad horny
fuckers.

20:22.586 --> 20:24.275
You were taking care of your
mother for years

20:24.379 --> 20:26.137
and it all just gets eaten up
somehow.

20:26.241 --> 20:28.344
God, I'm 30.

20:29.275 --> 20:32.000
What have I got to show
for ten years of this shit?

20:33.344 --> 20:35.068
Brain dead big dick Darren

20:35.448 --> 20:38.034
who sits in my apartment that I
pay for,

20:38.275 --> 20:40.103
playing video games all day.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.034
Then what else are we gonna do?

20:42.448 --> 20:45.034
Working at McDonald? Sushi
chef?

20:45.724 --> 20:48.448
Executive assistant to Apple
CEO?

20:48.724 --> 20:50.586
I'm starting to understand her
better.

20:50.896 --> 20:53.896
Now, I think my days on the
pole are finally over.

20:54.931 --> 20:56.724
I don't know
why I'm so depressed about it.

20:56.827 --> 20:58.827
'Cause change is scary, <i>chica.</i>

21:00.000 --> 21:01.586
Even if it's for the best.

21:04.344 --> 21:05.655
<i>Kishi kaisei.</i>

21:05.758 --> 21:06.689
Come again.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.000
It means to come out of bad
situation

21:12.379 --> 21:14.137
and make a glorious return

21:14.241 --> 21:15.965
in one sudden burst.

21:18.448 --> 21:20.241
Now, that I totally understood.

21:27.103 --> 21:28.068
<i>Kishi kaisei.</i>

21:40.206 --> 21:41.034
Fuck.

21:57.275 --> 21:58.172
Hi.

22:00.724 --> 22:02.793
I'm not really interested in
company.

22:02.896 --> 22:04.896
Jessica. It's-- It's Michael.
Mike.

22:06.275 --> 22:07.413
Mike?

22:07.517 --> 22:08.793
From the club. Mike.

22:09.724 --> 22:13.344
No, I-- I'm-- I'm the barback.
Some of the girls call me Mikey.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.206
- Right.
- Right.

22:16.310 --> 22:17.241
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:17.344 --> 22:18.862
I get that a lot, you know?

22:18.965 --> 22:20.620
People not remembering me too
much.

22:21.379 --> 22:22.482
I'm sorry.

22:23.620 --> 22:26.172
I just had a rough couple of
days.

22:26.275 --> 22:29.793
I heard. Everyone's heard.
Karl's?

22:31.172 --> 22:32.275
not a good person.

22:33.275 --> 22:34.551
He's an asshole.

22:35.344 --> 22:37.103
What goes around comes around,
right?

22:39.206 --> 22:40.172
He'll get his.

22:41.344 --> 22:42.689
You really believe that?

22:43.482 --> 22:44.517
I?

22:46.517 --> 22:47.551
I guarantee it.

22:49.655 --> 22:50.758
Karma?

22:51.413 --> 22:53.137
No, I don't trust karma.

22:54.551 --> 22:55.827
Can I get you another drink?

22:58.965 --> 23:00.724
Sure. Why not?

23:02.241 --> 23:03.172
Garçon.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.172
I'm boring you with my boring,
pathetic life story.

23:19.275 --> 23:20.758
No, far from it.

23:21.517 --> 23:23.034
How long have you worked at the
club?

23:23.137 --> 23:24.172
A few months.

23:24.275 --> 23:27.137
And what brought you
to glorious Reno, Nevada?

23:27.241 --> 23:28.068
I'm?

23:29.206 --> 23:31.034
I'm hoping for a fresh start, a
new life.

23:32.413 --> 23:34.103
I could go for that too.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.137
Listen, Mikey.

23:39.241 --> 23:40.896
Please. Just Mike.

23:42.034 --> 23:44.379
Mike, I should get going.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.517
I've got a long night ahead of
me

23:46.620 --> 23:49.482
of lamenting my past,
fearing my future, and?

23:50.137 --> 23:52.310
Bleary-eyed insomnia ahead of
me.

23:54.586 --> 23:55.758
What if I told you

23:55.862 --> 23:58.241
there was a way to give Karl
what he's got coming

23:58.344 --> 24:01.448
and a very bright and happy,
insomnia-free future for you?

24:03.827 --> 24:05.000
I'm listening.

24:05.827 --> 24:07.068
Look, I can't talk about it
here.

24:07.172 --> 24:09.103
Maybe we could go somewhere
a little more private.

24:10.655 --> 24:13.310
Sure. Maybe, another time.

24:13.413 --> 24:14.517
- No. Not--
- Yeah.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.137
Wait. Look, listen, I?

24:18.034 --> 24:19.862
I may not believe in karma,
but?

24:19.965 --> 24:22.448
I do believe things happen for
a reason, Jessica.

24:22.551 --> 24:24.482
Look, I know you're going
through a rough patch,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.448
but think about this.

24:26.793 --> 24:28.827
Today is the oldest you've ever
been?

24:29.689 --> 24:31.068
and you'll never be this young
again.

24:32.965 --> 24:34.000
Here's my number

24:34.206 --> 24:35.620
and it's worth the listen.

24:35.724 --> 24:36.827
I promise.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.862
You're not as hot
as those girls out there.

25:01.965 --> 25:02.862
Not anymore.

25:03.448 --> 25:04.931
<i>I'm a mover and shaker, baby!</i>

25:05.137 --> 25:07.448
You're gonna regret not fucking
me when you had the chance.

25:07.758 --> 25:10.275
<i>How much longer do you think</i>
<i>you can keep doing this for</i> <i>anyway?</i>

25:10.379 --> 25:12.206
<i>As long as I fucking have to.</i>

25:36.206 --> 25:38.137
"Today is the oldest you've
ever been,

25:38.241 --> 25:40.068
and you'll never be this young
again."

25:45.034 --> 25:46.896
That's about enough
to make your head explode.

25:52.586 --> 25:53.724
All right, Mikey.

25:54.862 --> 25:57.000
Better not be another crazy nut
job.

26:27.310 --> 26:28.275
Howdy.

26:28.724 --> 26:30.655
I-- I-- I didn't think you'd
call,

26:30.862 --> 26:32.655
but I'm sure glad you did.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.517
Well, I didn't think you could
afford a place like this.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.689
Yeah. Come on in.

26:38.172 --> 26:40.793
Well? to be totally
transparent?

26:42.620 --> 26:43.655
I'm renting it.

26:44.137 --> 26:46.965
I had a little cash put aside.

26:50.827 --> 26:52.103
Can I get you something to
drink?

26:52.620 --> 26:53.655
How about a water?

26:54.241 --> 26:55.413
That's easy enough.

26:56.103 --> 26:57.620
One water coming up.

26:59.137 --> 27:00.379
Extra cold.

27:01.517 --> 27:02.862
I like my water cold.

27:05.655 --> 27:08.586
- So? this plan of yours?
- Right.

27:10.034 --> 27:10.965
Okay.

27:12.620 --> 27:15.172
I didn't come to work at the
club as some lowly barback.

27:15.793 --> 27:18.793
I came to work at the club to
check out a story I had heard.

27:18.896 --> 27:21.793
Specifically about our friend
Karl.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.206
Such a douche bag.

27:24.655 --> 27:26.862
I've heard for years
he's run coke through the club.

27:27.172 --> 27:28.137
Maybe?

27:28.241 --> 27:29.620
but that's peanuts

27:30.034 --> 27:32.413
compared to the millions in
hard cash

27:32.517 --> 27:33.758
that run through that joint.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.206
Millions?

27:36.137 --> 27:37.379
Where did you hear that?

27:37.655 --> 27:38.689
Where else?

27:39.931 --> 27:40.827
Prison.

27:42.517 --> 27:44.344
Folsom State Prison,
California.

27:46.586 --> 27:47.931
<i>You went to prison?</i>

27:48.862 --> 27:51.275
<i>I was the getaway driver on a</i>
<i>robbery that went busto.</i>

27:51.379 --> 27:53.206
<i>Ended up in a cell</i>
<i>with two guys from Memphis</i>

27:53.310 --> 27:54.586
<i>who'd been working here in</i>
<i>Reno.</i>

27:54.689 --> 27:56.896
<i>And they told me a story.</i>

27:57.000 --> 27:59.379
Every third Saturday of every
third month.

27:59.689 --> 28:01.655
Two to three million dollars
gets?

28:01.758 --> 28:03.000
Sometimes four.

28:03.310 --> 28:04.655
Could be as much as four.

28:04.965 --> 28:07.827
Sometimes four gets flown out
to the Cook Island.

28:08.068 --> 28:08.931
Cook Island?

28:09.034 --> 28:10.689
In the motherfucking South
Pacific.

28:10.793 --> 28:12.448
Right. Like the musical.

28:12.551 --> 28:14.620
My nigga, are you a fag?

28:14.827 --> 28:16.172
Me? No.

28:16.275 --> 28:19.620
Then how would you
reference a musical like a fag?

28:19.965 --> 28:21.551
Pretty fucking faggot, Mike.

28:22.689 --> 28:24.000
Just joking around.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.793
I ain't got no problem with a
fag.

28:25.896 --> 28:27.103
My cousin's a fag.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.758
I just don't think they make
for the best criminals.

28:30.758 --> 28:33.103
Now, focus please.

28:33.206 --> 28:36.931
The money gets pooled at a
strip joint called Club Risqué.

28:37.275 --> 28:40.413
And that's the first time
I heard the word Risqué.

28:41.275 --> 28:42.275
Go on.

28:43.068 --> 28:45.620
- What money?
- Cash. Tons of it

28:45.724 --> 28:48.137
from? two casinos, four drug
houses,

28:48.241 --> 28:50.448
six liquor stores,
and even a family-owned bank.

28:50.551 --> 28:52.758
And they give it to a strip
club.

28:52.965 --> 28:56.310
The manager, this sour-pussed
jack-off,

28:56.413 --> 28:58.758
my man called him Sweaty Pig.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.137
Damn.

29:00.413 --> 29:02.137
Who thought Sweaty Pig
was a good nickname?

29:02.241 --> 29:03.793
Man, what's that matter?

29:04.137 --> 29:05.413
I'm just curious. That's all.

29:05.758 --> 29:06.965
Shit.

29:07.586 --> 29:08.827
Sweaty Pig works like an agent.

29:09.172 --> 29:10.551
He pulls the money at the club,

29:10.655 --> 29:12.068
flies them off to the Cooks,

29:12.172 --> 29:14.172
deposits them into separate
accounts,

29:14.275 --> 29:15.517
takes a fee for his service.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.137
Five percent or so, I've been
told.

29:17.241 --> 29:19.344
Ten percent or so, I been told.
Ten percent.

29:19.448 --> 29:20.413
What does that matter?

29:20.517 --> 29:22.413
Motherfuckers gotta know the
details, man.

29:22.517 --> 29:23.482
Shoot.

29:24.758 --> 29:26.655
So, why would they tell you all
this?

29:27.172 --> 29:28.413
We were cellies.

29:28.896 --> 29:31.448
They were both lifers and I had
a year left on my sentence.

29:31.551 --> 29:32.655
So, we made a deal.

29:32.758 --> 29:35.448
If I could figure out a clean
way to snatch the dough,

29:35.551 --> 29:38.586
I hand over 20 percent to the
boys' families in Memphis.

29:40.793 --> 29:42.068
So, you came to Reno

29:42.172 --> 29:44.793
to steal the money on that
third Saturday.

29:44.896 --> 29:46.827
Got out and made a bee-line
for the one place

29:46.931 --> 29:48.655
that just might change my life
forever.

29:52.586 --> 29:53.758
Risqué.

29:57.172 --> 29:58.344
Do you have a beer?

30:00.275 --> 30:02.206
Okay, so how do you know
what they told you

30:02.310 --> 30:05.862
wasn't the rantings
of some delusional cons.

30:06.379 --> 30:07.517
Why would they lie to me?

30:07.793 --> 30:09.103
There's nothing in it for them.

30:09.379 --> 30:11.068
Besides, I've spent the last
four months

30:11.172 --> 30:13.206
checking out the tale
and from what I can tell?

30:13.586 --> 30:14.965
it's dead on legit.

30:16.379 --> 30:18.344
<i>Right around midnight</i>
<i>on that third Saturday,</i>

30:18.448 --> 30:20.655
<i>the third month at the Eldorado</i>
<i>and the Peppermill</i>

30:20.862 --> 30:22.689
<i>men dump what looks like</i>
<i>laundry</i>

30:22.793 --> 30:24.344
<i>into a nondescript laundry</i>
<i>truck.</i>

30:29.068 --> 30:31.482
<i>Same goes liquor stores and</i>
<i>the bank.</i>

30:41.379 --> 30:44.034
<i>I tracked an address</i>
<i>to a small house in the burbs</i>

30:44.137 --> 30:46.310
<i>where they must combine it</i>
<i>into one shipment.</i>

30:47.344 --> 30:48.551
<i>And then the next night,</i>

30:48.965 --> 30:50.172
<i>Karl arrives,</i>

30:50.931 --> 30:52.827
<i>he parks his car in his usual</i>
<i>spot,</i>

30:53.620 --> 30:54.965
<i>gives his key to the valet.</i>

30:59.137 --> 31:01.620
<i>And right on cue,</i>
<i>this tall muscular guy</i>

31:01.724 --> 31:02.862
<i>takes it straight to the club</i>

31:02.965 --> 31:05.827
<i>and enters Karl's</i>
<i>AKA Sweaty Pig's office.</i>

31:07.689 --> 31:09.448
My God. I know that guy.

31:09.551 --> 31:10.689
I know him.

31:10.793 --> 31:11.931
He's been coming in for years.

31:12.206 --> 31:13.827
At Folsom, they told me there's
a safe,

31:13.931 --> 31:15.448
a-- a big wide floor safe

31:15.551 --> 31:17.034
right under Karl's chair.

31:17.413 --> 31:19.448
<i>At exactly 4:15 on Sunday</i>
<i>morning,</i>

31:19.551 --> 31:21.068
<i>another man enters the club,</i>

31:21.172 --> 31:23.275
<i>picks up the cash and dumps it</i>
<i>into a waiting car.</i>

31:24.655 --> 31:26.000
<i>They load it onto a jet?</i>

31:27.344 --> 31:28.689
<i>and the money goes, bye bye.</i>

31:29.862 --> 31:31.068
<i>Clean,</i>

31:31.172 --> 31:32.206
<i>no taxes.</i>

31:32.551 --> 31:35.275
<i>Nice vig to Karl</i>
<i>and everyone's happy, happy.</i>

31:35.482 --> 31:36.448
Wait a minute.

31:36.793 --> 31:39.931
How the fuck did those two guys
at Folsom know about all this?

31:40.034 --> 31:42.413
How the fuck do you guys
know about all this?

31:42.517 --> 31:44.413
You're looking at the original
bagmen on the job.

31:44.689 --> 31:45.896
You're shitting me.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.724
Until this asshole got greedy.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.034
Talked me into robbing an
Indian casino

31:51.137 --> 31:52.931
- in Palm Springs.
- We would've made it out clean.

31:53.034 --> 31:54.793
Except this trigger happy
motherfucker shot two guards.

31:54.896 --> 31:56.448
'Cause your dumb ass
wasn't paying attention.

31:56.551 --> 31:58.965
I was damn sure payin'
attention to you shooting them mother fuckers!

31:59.379 --> 32:00.655
- Shit.
- Shit.

32:02.206 --> 32:03.724
Shit.

32:08.620 --> 32:09.620
Great guys.

32:09.724 --> 32:11.241
Holy shit.

32:16.896 --> 32:18.068
I have to say?

32:19.068 --> 32:20.206
I'm impressed.

32:24.896 --> 32:27.068
But why tell me all this?

32:28.172 --> 32:30.793
What can I do? I don't even
work there anymore.

32:32.655 --> 32:33.965
I need a partner.

32:34.068 --> 32:35.310
I can't do this alone.

32:36.103 --> 32:38.413
The-- The key is to rob good
old Karl,

32:38.517 --> 32:40.172
AKA Sweaty Pig. Blind.

32:40.275 --> 32:42.172
Make damn sure no one knows
who pulled it off.

32:42.275 --> 32:43.586
This isn't Karl's money.

32:43.689 --> 32:44.827
This is drug dealers' money.

32:44.931 --> 32:46.586
Casinos' money. Banks' money.

32:47.172 --> 32:49.551
I don't wanna spend
the rest of my life in paradise

32:49.655 --> 32:51.034
looking over my shoulder.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.586
That's not paradise.

32:54.241 --> 32:56.310
I can't believe
I didn't know you at the club.

32:57.206 --> 33:00.275
It's like I didn't recognize
you at all.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.137
I've been a background player a
long time.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.965
Now, it's my turn to be the
star.

33:06.206 --> 33:07.965
Finally, get the girl in last
reel.

33:10.206 --> 33:11.620
Metaphorically, of course.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.620
So, you in, Jess?

33:23.793 --> 33:24.862
I don't know.

33:26.793 --> 33:28.379
Solves your current problem

33:28.482 --> 33:31.241
and any future problem
in the same bold move.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.344
<i>Kishi kaisei.</i>

33:39.482 --> 33:40.344
What?

33:44.241 --> 33:46.172
It's? Japanese.

33:46.827 --> 33:48.275
It means something like?

33:49.965 --> 33:52.034
to come out of a bad situation

33:52.137 --> 33:55.517
and make a glorious return
in one sudden burst.

34:03.586 --> 34:04.931
What would you need from me?

34:05.034 --> 34:06.275
Well, not just you.

34:06.965 --> 34:09.448
We'd need three or four other
girls from the club

34:09.551 --> 34:10.448
to pull it off.

34:10.758 --> 34:12.034
Girls we can trust.

34:12.344 --> 34:14.000
Girls you can trust.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.137
<i>Hola,</i>sweetie.

34:23.241 --> 34:24.344
Hi, Carmen.

34:24.448 --> 34:26.482
<i>I was just going to call you</i>
<i>and check in.</i>

34:26.586 --> 34:27.689
Everything all right?

34:28.551 --> 34:29.724
Turn that shit down.

34:29.827 --> 34:31.482
The sound is everything in this
game.

34:31.586 --> 34:32.862
Take this shit in the bedroom.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.689
Yes. Great. Amazing.

34:40.793 --> 34:43.448
- Did you get laid?
<i>- Even better.</i>

34:44.137 --> 34:46.724
I think it's time for a slumber
party at my house.

34:50.655 --> 34:53.172
You wanna hear a crazy ass
stripper story?

34:53.275 --> 34:54.689
'Cause I've got a doozy.

34:55.724 --> 34:57.241
When I first moved here, right?

34:57.931 --> 34:59.551
I worked in Phoenix

35:00.137 --> 35:02.689
with this girl named Busty
Betty.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.517
And she has? I'm not
exaggerating, okay?

35:05.827 --> 35:07.931
Triple H tits.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.172
<i>It's crazy.</i>

35:13.275 --> 35:14.482
<i>Yeah, it was wild.</i>

35:15.137 --> 35:17.551
<i>Anyway, one night she's</i>
<i>dancing for this old fart.</i>

35:17.655 --> 35:20.551
<i>I mean, the guy had to be at</i>
<i>least at 80, right?</i>

35:20.655 --> 35:22.931
And she straddles him on the
chair

35:23.034 --> 35:25.620
<i>and pushes his head down,</i>
<i>so he is staring right at her.</i>

35:26.931 --> 35:27.965
You know the type,

35:28.068 --> 35:29.586
we all know the type. Come on.

35:29.689 --> 35:31.551
<i>And everyone's cheering on the</i>
<i>old dude,</i>

35:31.655 --> 35:33.275
<i>and he's like in total heaven.</i>

35:33.379 --> 35:35.793
<i>Best night of his fricking</i>
<i>life, kind of thing, right?</i>

35:35.896 --> 35:39.310
And then, Betty just decides to
slap her left tit

35:39.586 --> 35:40.689
down on his face.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.344
<i>And I mean, hard enough to</i>
<i>break his nose,</i>

35:43.448 --> 35:44.689
<i>pop out his dentures,</i>

35:44.793 --> 35:47.206
and knocked the poor bastard
totally unconscious.

35:47.310 --> 35:49.206
Like, boom, lights out.

35:49.310 --> 35:51.034
Bon voyage, mate. You have a
nice life.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.000
Shit.

35:59.172 --> 36:00.344
Did you invite Bianka?

36:02.827 --> 36:03.758
I did.

36:04.206 --> 36:07.413
I wasn't aware Germans were the
silk jammy sleepover type.

36:09.275 --> 36:10.310
I'm now.

36:13.275 --> 36:14.310
You all know Bianka.

36:16.034 --> 36:17.000
<i>Danke!</i>

36:17.862 --> 36:20.724
That's "Thank you".

36:21.827 --> 36:23.103
"Guten Abend" is correct.

36:25.137 --> 36:27.172
Very impressive.

36:27.482 --> 36:29.689
How-- How did you learn
Japanese?

36:29.793 --> 36:31.827
I spent three years stripping
in Tokyo.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.517
Hated the men there.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.137
Small dicks,

36:36.482 --> 36:37.689
no tips.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.034
What the fuck?

36:41.137 --> 36:42.793
- Awful.
- Okay.

36:42.896 --> 36:45.931
You have got to be the coolest
chick

36:46.034 --> 36:49.689
I think I've ever met.
Like, seriously, shit.

36:50.655 --> 36:52.482
Would you like something to
drink?

36:54.482 --> 36:55.344
Vodka.

36:56.379 --> 36:57.965
Cliché, I know.

36:58.206 --> 37:00.379
So, you said you wanted
to talk to me about something.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.482
I must warn you I'm not into
shoes

37:06.586 --> 37:07.827
or boys or clothes

37:07.931 --> 37:09.172
or makeup or shopping

37:09.275 --> 37:10.689
or any of the other bullshit

37:10.793 --> 37:12.310
that strippers normally spew on
about.

37:13.586 --> 37:14.758
What are you into?

37:17.241 --> 37:19.724
Muscle cars,
real men who know how to fuck,

37:19.827 --> 37:22.206
Italian furniture from the
Renaissance,

37:22.310 --> 37:25.172
French films from the '60s? and
Kafka.

37:25.275 --> 37:26.310
<i>The Chase?</i>

37:27.724 --> 37:28.758
He's a writer.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.965
Well, I only read astrology
books, so.

37:32.275 --> 37:33.620
I can imagine.

37:33.724 --> 37:35.931
Yeah, you're a little intense.

37:36.241 --> 37:39.034
Okay. I can just cut right to
the chase.

37:40.413 --> 37:41.310
So?

37:42.379 --> 37:44.689
you guys all know Mike the
barback at the club?

37:45.758 --> 37:47.172
- Vaguely.
- Nothing.

37:47.275 --> 37:49.724
Short, lonely.

37:50.206 --> 37:51.517
Sad eyes.

37:51.620 --> 37:53.827
- Yeah, that's him. -You made me
drive all the way up here

37:53.931 --> 37:55.655
to talk to me about that loser?

37:55.758 --> 37:56.758
Not him,

37:57.034 --> 38:00.379
but something really amazing
he just told me.

38:02.206 --> 38:03.517
What I'm about to tell you

38:03.862 --> 38:05.758
can never leave this room.

38:06.379 --> 38:07.482
Agreed?

38:07.724 --> 38:08.896
I'm in whatever it is.

38:09.896 --> 38:10.862
Okay.

38:12.620 --> 38:13.655
She agrees.

38:13.758 --> 38:14.827
So do I.

38:17.965 --> 38:18.862
Now, spill.

38:29.206 --> 38:30.517
Who would have thunk it?

38:31.379 --> 38:33.310
I couldn't sleep all night.

38:33.620 --> 38:35.103
I think it makes sense.

38:36.068 --> 38:38.793
- I'm out.
- What? You said you were in?

38:39.689 --> 38:42.275
Yes, in. No out. I'm in. In.

38:43.344 --> 38:44.724
Karl told me

38:45.310 --> 38:46.551
he had a place in Aspen.

38:46.655 --> 38:49.379
Told me he had an apartment
in Manhattan.

38:50.172 --> 38:52.586
He say to me he has one in
Paris.

38:53.172 --> 38:55.551
What? Big Boy Billy spews the
same shit.

38:55.655 --> 38:59.068
He's a millionaire.
He's gonna be a billionaire.

38:59.172 --> 39:01.068
Little Donald Trump wannabe?

39:01.758 --> 39:03.103
with worse hair.

39:04.724 --> 39:07.689
I'd believe Karl over
that sad cunt Billy any day.

39:10.620 --> 39:12.965
And now, straight from United
Kingdom.

39:13.448 --> 39:14.862
Risqué's own,

39:15.241 --> 39:16.448
Shelby.

39:16.551 --> 39:18.482
Okay. I'm up. BRB.

39:18.586 --> 39:19.896
- Okay.
- Buh-bye.

39:24.655 --> 39:26.862
Yeah. Let's go, Shelby.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.034
Interesting sleepover.

39:43.206 --> 39:44.413
It was my first.

39:51.206 --> 39:52.206
Are you in?

39:58.034 --> 39:59.448
You are up on the main stage.

40:05.827 --> 40:07.896
Don't want Karl to get angry
now

40:08.000 --> 40:10.793
if he catches us talking
like little loudmouth birdies,

40:10.896 --> 40:11.896
do we?

40:18.965 --> 40:20.689
Dumb Mexican.

40:21.551 --> 40:23.448
German Hooker.

40:44.965 --> 40:46.000
My God.

41:04.310 --> 41:06.137
It's looking very CSI, Mike.

41:06.448 --> 41:07.344
I know, right?

41:07.448 --> 41:08.517
Wait, wait.

41:08.620 --> 41:10.448
So, this all happens
during Eyes Wide Shut?

41:10.551 --> 41:12.758
Yes. No one can ever know
who pulled this off.

41:12.862 --> 41:15.275
That's the key. Just like <i>The</i>
<i>Sting.</i>

41:15.689 --> 41:16.689
A bee sting?

41:16.965 --> 41:20.241
No singer Sting. "Every Breath
You Take."

41:20.965 --> 41:22.241
No, I think he means

41:22.344 --> 41:24.620
like the movie <i>The Sting,</i>
right?

41:25.000 --> 41:26.586
Robert Redford. Paul Newman.

41:26.689 --> 41:27.862
The salad dressing bloke?

41:27.965 --> 41:30.310
Forget it. The key is to pull
off the heist

41:30.413 --> 41:31.620
and walk away clean.

41:33.344 --> 41:35.034
Do you really think this could
work?

41:35.137 --> 41:38.068
It's a better plan than I
thought this guy could come up with.

41:39.344 --> 41:40.793
Run through it again, please,
Mike.

41:40.896 --> 41:41.862
Okay.

41:41.965 --> 41:43.413
So, couple of minutes

41:43.517 --> 41:45.655
before the Eyes Wide Shut
number starts,

41:45.758 --> 41:47.344
Jessica enters the club

41:47.551 --> 41:49.448
and joins you guys in the
dressing room.

41:50.793 --> 41:53.620
<i>And no one even knows I'm there</i>
<i>because of the masks.</i>

41:53.827 --> 41:54.862
<i>Brilliant.</i>

41:55.517 --> 41:57.862
<i>You run through the show</i>
<i>staying on stage.</i>

41:59.103 --> 42:02.206
<i>When the girls all head into</i>
<i>the audience for the private</i> <i>dances,</i>

42:03.000 --> 42:04.827
<i>that's when you guys break off.</i>

42:06.620 --> 42:09.137
Kiko and Shelby make their way
to the eye in the sky.

42:11.896 --> 42:13.862
<i>While Jessica, Bianka and</i>
<i>Carmen</i>

42:14.379 --> 42:15.931
<i>head toward Karl's office.</i>

42:16.241 --> 42:17.275
<i>God, let's hope</i>

42:17.379 --> 42:19.896
the astrophysics spectrum
arrives with emphasis,

42:20.000 --> 42:21.448
which to be fair,

42:21.551 --> 42:24.172
it should 'cause Venus unites
with Ceres at four degrees of Capricorn.

42:24.275 --> 42:25.275
What?

42:25.379 --> 42:26.896
That's the sign of success.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.655
Money, you know?

42:28.758 --> 42:29.862
High finance.

42:30.310 --> 42:32.724
Trust me, we're gonna want the
whole bloody universe on our side.

42:32.827 --> 42:34.068
It's actually critical.

42:34.172 --> 42:35.965
What's critical is that you and
Kiko get

42:36.068 --> 42:37.413
Big Billy Boy put away.

42:37.620 --> 42:39.413
If he pushes that security
button,

42:39.517 --> 42:42.000
all the emphasis of Venus
sitting on Capricorn's dick

42:42.103 --> 42:43.344
is not going to mean shit.

42:43.689 --> 42:44.931
Rude.

42:45.137 --> 42:46.103
Go on.

42:46.206 --> 42:47.482
Billy boy's a horny bastard,

42:47.586 --> 42:49.068
<i>so just start dancing for him.</i>

42:53.103 --> 42:55.413
<i>Get him back in the chair</i>
<i>and slap the cuffs on him.</i>

42:55.827 --> 42:57.517
<i>Well, that'll be a piece of</i>
<i>piss.</i>

42:58.758 --> 43:01.724
<i>I get a sense </i>
<i>Karl can't stand that fat fuck.</i>

43:01.965 --> 43:04.586
<i>He's just stuck with him</i>
<i>'cause he is the owner's</i> <i>nephew.</i>

43:04.827 --> 43:06.000
<i>At that moment,</i>

43:06.103 --> 43:07.655
<i>Bianka will stand guard</i>

43:07.758 --> 43:09.000
at the door to Karl's office

43:09.103 --> 43:10.586
as Jessica and Carmen burst in.

43:14.448 --> 43:15.758
What the fuck?

43:16.068 --> 43:17.482
<i>Wait, hold up.</i>

43:17.586 --> 43:19.448
You want me to stand guard?

43:20.206 --> 43:22.620
while Jessica and Carmen hit
the room?

43:22.931 --> 43:24.068
What were you thinking?

43:24.172 --> 43:25.344
I know guns.

43:25.448 --> 43:26.862
I know how to shoot a gun.

43:26.965 --> 43:29.482
I've shot many guns. I know
that the?

43:29.586 --> 43:31.000
Hold on, Tupac.

43:31.344 --> 43:33.206
We're not actually gonna shoot
the guns, right?

43:33.689 --> 43:36.000
No. No, not if everything goes
as planned.

43:36.103 --> 43:39.172
The last thing we want is some
O.K. Corral bullshit shoot 'em up.

43:39.379 --> 43:40.413
But we might.

43:41.310 --> 43:44.034
Well, I've never even held a
gun before.

43:44.551 --> 43:45.586
I've been shot at,

43:45.793 --> 43:47.000
but never shoot one.

43:47.379 --> 43:49.517
My ex used to put one by my
vagina.

43:53.310 --> 43:55.137
Listen, I was an army
reservist.

43:55.241 --> 43:56.103
Went to Iraq.

43:56.206 --> 43:57.827
I'll teach you guys how to
handle a gun.

43:57.931 --> 43:59.896
- Okay? -But will they have
bullets in them?

44:00.275 --> 44:01.206
Maybe I'll carry mace.

44:01.310 --> 44:03.344
Yeah. Fuck it.
I'm just gonna bring my own.

44:03.586 --> 44:05.068
I think that's a good idea.

44:05.172 --> 44:07.172
I'm not sure if I trust this
one with live ammo.

44:07.275 --> 44:10.000
Well, maybe I don't bloody
trust you running around with a live gun.

44:10.103 --> 44:11.000
You know?

44:11.206 --> 44:13.068
What with being German and all?

44:13.827 --> 44:16.068
- I'm Hungarian.
- Whatever.

44:16.172 --> 44:17.758
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean?

44:18.034 --> 44:19.206
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

44:19.310 --> 44:21.310
Okay. Ladies, how about we
listen

44:21.413 --> 44:22.896
to what Mike has to say?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.275
Well, listen, I think Jess
deserves

44:25.379 --> 44:27.241
a little payback on Karl.

44:27.344 --> 44:31.620
His office smells like dog
farts and Old Spice. I'll stand guard.

44:31.724 --> 44:33.586
Okay, perfect. Problem solved.

44:40.689 --> 44:41.965
What the fuck?

44:47.517 --> 44:48.517
Fuck!

44:51.620 --> 44:53.655
<i>Bianka will hold the shotgun</i>
<i>on Karl,</i>

44:53.758 --> 44:55.862
<i>while Jess pulls up the carpet</i>
<i>under his chair</i>

44:55.965 --> 44:57.034
<i>to reveal the safe.</i>

44:57.241 --> 44:58.724
<i>Jess will then take the</i>
<i>combination</i>

44:58.827 --> 45:00.000
<i>and open the safe.</i>

45:00.413 --> 45:01.758
<i>Just a second.</i>

45:01.862 --> 45:03.793
How do I get the combination?

45:04.068 --> 45:06.344
I mean, why would he just give
it up?

45:06.448 --> 45:07.448
Well.

45:07.551 --> 45:09.482
When a man has a shotgun
leveled at his head

45:09.586 --> 45:11.137
and another one at his balls,

45:11.241 --> 45:13.034
he'll do exactly what we tell
him to do.

45:13.793 --> 45:15.793
- Precisely.
- I'm glad we switched.

45:16.034 --> 45:17.586
Good to have Bianka in the
room.

45:18.551 --> 45:20.000
Once that safe slides open,

45:20.103 --> 45:21.206
time is of the essence.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.931
<i>So, don't just stand there</i>
<i>slack-jawed</i>

45:25.034 --> 45:26.275
<i>staring at the millions.</i>

45:29.241 --> 45:31.379
<i>Just start stuffing the cash</i>
<i>into the robes,</i>

45:31.482 --> 45:33.931
<i>which will have extra-large</i>
<i>pockets sewn inside.</i>

45:35.103 --> 45:36.275
<i>Once in the hallway,</i>

45:36.379 --> 45:37.965
<i>you'll see a trash cart,</i>

45:38.068 --> 45:40.000
<i>which I've strategically</i>
<i>placed there.</i>

45:43.275 --> 45:44.448
And one by one?

45:46.448 --> 45:49.034
<i>drop the robes filled with the</i>
<i>cash?</i>

45:49.758 --> 45:50.793
<i>into the bin.</i>

45:52.931 --> 45:54.241
<i>Jess, you hop in.</i>

45:54.896 --> 45:56.620
<i>Just before the show finishes,</i>

45:57.275 --> 45:58.931
<i>you guys are back dancing?</i>

46:00.310 --> 46:02.379
<i>and I'm just an innocent</i>
<i>barback,</i>

46:02.482 --> 46:03.965
<i>wheeling out the trash?</i>

46:04.793 --> 46:06.000
<i>and Jess?</i>

46:06.724 --> 46:08.275
<i>and no one's the wiser.</i>

46:10.034 --> 46:12.000
But what happens when someone
finally finds Karl?

46:12.310 --> 46:13.379
or Big Boy Billy?

46:13.482 --> 46:14.517
Nothing happens.

46:14.896 --> 46:17.068
- They'll call the cops.
- And what's he gonna tell him?

46:17.275 --> 46:18.758
"Someone stole the illegal drug
money,

46:18.862 --> 46:20.586
I've been illegally flying
to the Cook Islands

46:20.689 --> 46:22.448
and depositing in offshore
accounts for years?"

46:22.655 --> 46:23.689
Hell no.

46:24.034 --> 46:25.241
He'll question all you girls,

46:25.344 --> 46:27.551
but almost 20 of you are in the
show

46:27.655 --> 46:28.965
and all wearing the masks.

46:29.068 --> 46:30.034
He'll be fucked.

46:30.344 --> 46:31.482
Maybe dead.

46:31.586 --> 46:32.551
Karma.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.310
What goes around comes around.

46:34.965 --> 46:36.172
So?

46:36.275 --> 46:37.413
thems my thoughts.

46:37.689 --> 46:39.758
It might need a nip and tuck
here and there, but?

46:41.517 --> 46:42.586
I know it can work.

46:42.689 --> 46:44.655
And when do you think we can
leave town?

46:44.758 --> 46:45.758
Not right away.

46:46.172 --> 46:47.551
One can quit, then another,

46:47.655 --> 46:49.310
might take six months
to get everybody out.

46:49.793 --> 46:51.206
Don't wanna raise any
suspicions.

46:51.310 --> 46:53.275
We shouldn't go around
like stupid strippers

46:53.379 --> 46:56.862
spending our money
on fancy cars and big houses.

46:56.965 --> 46:59.413
Exactly. Think of <i>Goodfellas.</i>
Lesson learned.

46:59.517 --> 47:00.896
Who?

47:01.586 --> 47:03.724
Scorsese? DeNiro? Pesci?

47:05.241 --> 47:06.206
Nothing?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
I'm out.

47:08.103 --> 47:09.034
She means in.

47:09.137 --> 47:10.068
Count me in.

47:10.551 --> 47:11.758
I like it so far.

47:11.862 --> 47:13.344
You had me at hello.

47:13.655 --> 47:15.551
For God's sake, tell me you
know what that's from.

47:15.655 --> 47:16.793
<i>Goodfellas?</i>

47:16.896 --> 47:17.965
Unbelievable.

47:18.068 --> 47:19.137
Well, I don't fucking know.

47:19.241 --> 47:21.000
Well, listen, we have one shot

47:21.103 --> 47:23.275
and there is zero, and I mean
zero

47:23.379 --> 47:24.862
room for error.

47:25.172 --> 47:26.413
No, we got this.

47:34.931 --> 47:35.862
To Mike.

47:37.344 --> 47:39.586
The happiest best time surprise

47:39.689 --> 47:43.034
that has come into my life
in a really long time.

47:44.068 --> 47:45.862
<i>Kishi kaisei!</i>

47:46.655 --> 47:48.586
<i>Kishi kaisei!</i>

47:58.068 --> 47:59.448
What will be my cut?

47:59.965 --> 48:01.965
70% to me. 20% to you

48:02.068 --> 48:03.448
and 10% to Franz to drive the
car.

48:04.103 --> 48:05.034
Okay.

48:05.137 --> 48:06.275
To get this straight?

48:06.551 --> 48:08.689
We wait outside the club
and when they exit,

48:08.793 --> 48:10.000
we rob them, yes?

48:13.241 --> 48:14.241
Yes!

48:27.379 --> 48:29.896
No!

48:31.862 --> 48:32.931
Or?

48:33.344 --> 48:34.551
we rob and kill?

48:39.448 --> 48:40.482
Going somewhere?

48:40.586 --> 48:42.103
Easy. Okay?

48:48.068 --> 48:49.206
Rob and kill.

48:49.310 --> 48:50.448
Leave no witnesses.

48:50.793 --> 48:51.965
Make it a clean job.

48:52.551 --> 48:55.793
Okay, then I want half,
plus ten percent for Franz.

48:56.344 --> 48:57.965
Sixty-five percent for me,

48:58.068 --> 49:00.034
and 35 for you and Franz.

49:00.137 --> 49:01.793
I don't give a fuck how you
split it.

49:04.137 --> 49:05.068
Sorry, brother.

49:05.310 --> 49:06.965
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

49:09.172 --> 49:10.137
Deal.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.379
You have a lot of nerve.

49:27.241 --> 49:29.965
Your father owes 150,000 to
Yakuza.

49:30.793 --> 49:33.758
50 to Murakumi-gumi, 50 to
Masuya-Kai?

49:34.586 --> 49:37.172
Not including what he owes to
Hashiya-Kai.

49:37.551 --> 49:39.000
Hashiya-Kai has already been
paid

49:39.965 --> 49:41.344
by Hiryoshi Sano.

49:41.448 --> 49:43.620
Only the principal. Not the
interest.

49:44.931 --> 49:46.275
When this is over?

49:47.206 --> 49:49.344
my father and my family will be
set free.

49:49.758 --> 49:51.000
Yes, of course.

49:52.827 --> 49:55.689
Now, you understand
what is going to happen.

49:56.241 --> 49:57.275
Yes.

49:59.551 --> 50:00.862
Will it be painless?

50:19.724 --> 50:21.172
They won't know what hit them.

50:29.310 --> 50:32.206
Sweet Scooby-Doo van
you got yourself there, Mike.

50:32.517 --> 50:34.413
Thanks. I call it the plan van.

50:35.379 --> 50:37.344
- The plan van.
- Plan van.

50:37.448 --> 50:39.448
- Okay, everybody, let's focus.
- Right.

50:39.758 --> 50:41.724
So, the stage show?

50:42.379 --> 50:44.206
<i>it lasts a total of five</i>
<i>minutes,</i>

50:44.310 --> 50:45.206
<i>24 seconds.</i>

50:46.344 --> 50:47.758
<i>And then the private dances</i>

50:47.862 --> 50:49.344
<i>are about four minutes longer.</i>

50:50.379 --> 50:53.137
<i>So let's say ten minutes total</i>
<i>that the girls are in costume.</i>

50:53.241 --> 50:54.310
It tight.

50:55.586 --> 50:57.689
- I-- I mean loose.
- No, tight is right.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.551
So, we need to make our move

50:59.655 --> 51:01.310
before the private dances.

51:01.413 --> 51:03.689
Maybe Jess and you never
even joined the stage show.

51:03.793 --> 51:05.482
Me and Kiko can pull out early.

51:05.586 --> 51:07.931
I left early last week
to go hang out with Roger.

51:08.034 --> 51:10.103
Nobody noticed anything. The
blind twats.

51:10.310 --> 51:11.689
Yeah. And if anyone asks,

51:11.793 --> 51:13.137
we just say

51:13.241 --> 51:14.965
we didn't get picked for a
dance.

51:15.068 --> 51:16.482
So exciting.

51:17.241 --> 51:18.655
Like, water movie.

51:19.068 --> 51:20.034
<i>Waterworld?</i>

51:20.137 --> 51:21.724
Fuck, no water.

51:24.068 --> 51:24.965
Ocean movie.

51:25.586 --> 51:26.931
She means <i>Ocean's Eleven.</i>

51:27.034 --> 51:28.724
- Did they get away with it?
- I think so.

51:28.827 --> 51:31.275
I didn't see <i>Ocean's Twelve</i>or
<i>Thirteen</i>though, so I'm not sure.

51:31.379 --> 51:33.931
I think I saw <i>Thirteen,</i>
but it could have been <i>Eight.</i>

51:34.034 --> 51:36.206
- The one with the girls.
- That's too unrealistic.

51:36.310 --> 51:38.103
Look, we're getting
a little off base here.

51:38.206 --> 51:40.172
If you guys don't feel ready,
we can push,

51:40.275 --> 51:42.724
you know, keep meeting and
working on it.

51:42.827 --> 51:44.827
We only have one chance
and it has to be perfect.

51:44.931 --> 51:47.344
No, I think we should do it
now.

51:47.448 --> 51:50.137
I mean, if we wait, if we hold
out we might not follow through.

51:50.241 --> 51:51.206
I think we're ready.

51:51.310 --> 51:52.862
I'm so sick of the fucking
club.

51:54.068 --> 51:56.137
- She said let's do it.
- Okay.

51:56.551 --> 51:58.206
Go home, get some sleep

51:58.310 --> 51:59.482
and then pack your bags

51:59.586 --> 52:01.896
'cause tomorrow we start some
real training at the house.

52:02.344 --> 52:03.689
We got the gear and the guns.

52:03.793 --> 52:04.758
Holy shit.

52:04.862 --> 52:06.517
We're really doing this, aren't
we?

52:06.724 --> 52:08.413
<i>Kishi kaisei,</i>bitches!

52:09.448 --> 52:11.241
<i>Kishi kaisei!</i>

52:45.551 --> 52:46.758
All right, ladies.

52:46.862 --> 52:48.275
Time is short,

52:48.862 --> 52:51.068
so let's get down to business.

53:06.517 --> 53:08.827
Okay. But right after dinner,
we get to work.

53:08.931 --> 53:10.000
Yes, sure.

53:12.758 --> 53:13.931
Toast!

53:18.275 --> 53:21.000
I've got buttery nipples!

53:24.034 --> 53:25.137
All righty.

53:26.241 --> 53:28.241
Right after dessert or whatever
this is,

53:28.344 --> 53:29.551
we hit the books. Agreed?

53:30.344 --> 53:32.482
- Agreed!
- Agreed!

53:34.344 --> 53:37.068
This isn't exactly what I meant
by hitting the books.

53:37.172 --> 53:38.482
Oy, pass it over.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.068
But?

53:40.448 --> 53:42.275
who am I to argue with my
partners?

53:43.241 --> 53:47.310
Mike, did you ever in your
wildest dreams

53:47.413 --> 53:51.793
think that you'd be getting
high in a jacuzzi with five strippers

53:51.896 --> 53:55.413
in a backyard of a
ten-million-dollar mansion in Tahoe?

53:56.068 --> 53:59.034
Sure, in my wildest dreams.

53:59.137 --> 54:01.655
I just? never thought
it would actually happen.

54:01.758 --> 54:02.931
Your turn, Mike.

54:03.551 --> 54:05.689
Have you ever had a lap dance,
Mike?

54:08.206 --> 54:09.068
No.

55:34.379 --> 55:36.137
You can touch.

55:55.655 --> 55:57.000
Did you have fun last night?

55:57.310 --> 55:58.310
Fun is?

55:59.758 --> 56:00.758
too cheap.

56:00.862 --> 56:02.758
Just? It doesn't do it justice.

56:03.310 --> 56:05.517
Thanks, Jess. You know, for
everything.

56:05.724 --> 56:07.275
You're the one I should be
thanking.

56:07.931 --> 56:09.482
I'm really grateful we met when
we did.

56:09.724 --> 56:12.241
Well? to be honest, we have met
before.

56:12.344 --> 56:14.137
- What?
- I didn't want to say anything.

56:14.241 --> 56:15.310
What do you mean? When?

56:16.344 --> 56:17.586
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

56:18.379 --> 56:19.379
Akela-B.

56:21.034 --> 56:22.103
The Coyotes.

56:23.068 --> 56:24.137
Principal White.

56:24.551 --> 56:25.965
West Central High?

56:26.482 --> 56:28.551
What do you mean?

56:29.379 --> 56:30.586
Holy shit.

56:34.551 --> 56:35.862
I have no memory of you.

56:36.586 --> 56:38.586
We had five classes together.

56:38.689 --> 56:39.724
My God.

56:40.137 --> 56:42.000
I wasn't very popular.

56:42.482 --> 56:43.931
Some guy you'd pass in the hall

56:44.034 --> 56:45.482
on your way to cheerleading
practice.

56:45.586 --> 56:47.344
But everybody knew Jessica
Collins.

56:48.103 --> 56:50.034
God. I'm so sorry.

56:50.344 --> 56:51.206
Come on.

56:51.310 --> 56:52.965
Why didn't you say something
sooner? I?

56:53.482 --> 56:55.793
I-- I came to Risqué for the
plan

56:55.896 --> 56:58.413
and I was surprised
when I saw you working there.

57:00.172 --> 57:02.689
I guess everyone else back home
would be surprised too.

57:02.793 --> 57:05.034
I was gonna say something right
away, but it felt sort of,

57:05.137 --> 57:06.724
I don't know, stalkerish, and?

57:07.310 --> 57:09.103
I thought maybe
you didn't want anyone to know.

57:10.482 --> 57:12.344
Cheerleader turned aging
stripper.

57:12.448 --> 57:13.689
It's pretty pathetic. I know.

57:13.793 --> 57:15.482
No, no, come on.

57:16.448 --> 57:17.379
It's just?

57:18.448 --> 57:19.517
it's just life.

57:22.827 --> 57:24.172
Maybe this is fate,

57:25.137 --> 57:26.068
destiny.

57:27.103 --> 57:30.137
All roads have led to this
moment and the chance for us to be

57:30.827 --> 57:32.758
king and queen of our own
little prom.

57:36.034 --> 57:37.793
- This is what day looks like.
- Wow.

57:38.206 --> 57:39.206
God.

57:39.310 --> 57:40.827
It's good place to bury a body.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.655
Christ, it's so early.

57:46.034 --> 57:47.172
It's 2:00 p.m.

57:47.862 --> 57:49.551
Yeah. Well, I'm just not a
morning,

57:49.965 --> 57:52.172
afternoon, or early evening
person.

58:00.827 --> 58:02.241
I assume you know how to use
it.

58:07.034 --> 58:08.172
You assumed correctly.

58:09.655 --> 58:11.000
You fucking badass.

58:11.103 --> 58:12.448
All right. Easy there, Harley
Quinn.

58:15.965 --> 58:17.068
For me?

58:21.275 --> 58:22.965
This thing's way too small.

58:23.068 --> 58:24.551
Let me have Carmen's.

58:25.275 --> 58:27.344
You think you can handle this,
Shelbita?

58:27.827 --> 58:30.068
You bet your ass, Carmenita.

58:32.724 --> 58:34.482
They'll be locked and loaded
before the heist,

58:34.586 --> 58:36.137
but here's how you load it.

58:37.103 --> 58:38.172
Real easy.

58:42.206 --> 58:43.482
I'm just thinking out loud
here,

58:43.586 --> 58:46.413
but maybe we shouldn't go in
with them loaded.

58:46.517 --> 58:49.241
But the idea here is to never
actually fire the guns.

58:49.448 --> 58:51.310
- Okay?
- Okay. Cool. Sounds good.

58:51.413 --> 58:53.241
If they see you carrying that
bad boy,

58:53.344 --> 58:54.517
the odds are a lot better.

58:54.620 --> 58:56.000
No one's gonna want to take any
chances.

58:56.103 --> 58:58.275
He's right, Shelby.
You look like super scary

58:58.379 --> 58:59.482
holding that thing.

59:00.482 --> 59:03.448
Now, I'm the bad ass German
motherfucker.

59:03.689 --> 59:04.689
Hungarian.

59:04.793 --> 59:05.793
Same shit.

59:06.448 --> 59:07.931
Take a shot, Shel.

59:12.586 --> 59:13.793
No, I can't do it.

59:14.379 --> 59:15.310
Look.

59:16.620 --> 59:17.827
Just try.

59:18.275 --> 59:20.448
What? It's not gonna hurt.
Right, Mike?

59:20.689 --> 59:22.551
- No.
- No. It's not that.

59:22.758 --> 59:24.000
I don't wanna shoot a tree.

59:25.413 --> 59:26.448
Come again.

59:27.793 --> 59:30.344
Trees are living, breathing
creatures.

59:30.586 --> 59:31.551
Fun fact,

59:31.655 --> 59:33.793
did you know there is a tree in
the Amazon

59:33.896 --> 59:35.137
whose roots reach over two
miles?

59:36.103 --> 59:37.931
What is this, fucking <i>Avatar?</i>

59:39.068 --> 59:40.241
Maybe I don't need a gun.

59:40.344 --> 59:42.413
Okay, don't shoot the trees.
Okay?

59:42.517 --> 59:45.344
But let's at least get
comfortable holding them and moving around, okay?

59:45.448 --> 59:46.448
All right.

59:50.172 --> 59:51.172
Ready. Okay?

59:51.827 --> 59:54.068
- It's kinda big.
- Just switch it. Yeah.

59:58.172 --> 59:59.448
Oi, you lot,

59:59.551 --> 01:00:00.827
does this look sexy

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:01.793
next to my boobs?

01:00:05.724 --> 01:00:06.793
What happened?

01:00:08.034 --> 01:00:09.310
You shoot Mikey.

01:00:09.896 --> 01:00:10.965
Are you sure?

01:00:11.413 --> 01:00:12.517
No.

01:00:13.482 --> 01:00:15.517
My God. Holy fuck.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.965
I didn't mean, I just?

01:00:17.068 --> 01:00:19.448
I literally just fell over,
right? And then, boom,

01:00:19.551 --> 01:00:20.862
I didn't even pull the trigger.

01:00:20.965 --> 01:00:22.344
Calm down. Shelby. Just calm
down.

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:23.620
Hey,

01:00:23.724 --> 01:00:24.793
can you hear me?

01:00:27.862 --> 01:00:28.862
What did she say?

01:00:30.965 --> 01:00:32.620
She asked if was going to die.

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:35.551
Should have read his horoscope
before we come up here.

01:00:40.344 --> 01:00:42.482
<i>Coyotes</i>

01:00:43.137 --> 01:00:46.965
<i>- Go, you mighty Coyotes</i>
<i>- Go, you mighty Coyotes</i>

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.896

01:00:49.724 --> 01:00:51.448

01:00:55.965 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah.

01:00:57.482 --> 01:00:59.379
I will see you in class, Jess.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.965
Mike, stay with me. Hey, look
at me.

01:01:02.448 --> 01:01:03.689
We need you. Don't die on us.

01:01:05.482 --> 01:01:07.827
Just have a rest. Okay.

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.793
What were you singing?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.689
It was our high school fight
song.

01:01:30.034 --> 01:01:31.655
You went to high school with
him?

01:01:32.034 --> 01:01:33.689
I didn't even remember him.

01:01:34.827 --> 01:01:36.172
Now, I'll never forget him.

01:01:37.379 --> 01:01:39.206
That's some freaky shit.

01:01:39.724 --> 01:01:40.793
What are we gonna do?

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:44.172
Well, we can just stand here
all day and do nothing.

01:01:44.655 --> 01:01:46.068
Shall we just leave him here?

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.655
No,

01:01:47.758 --> 01:01:50.034
I'm not just gonna leave him
out here like this.

01:01:50.379 --> 01:01:52.724
Maybe we should just go tell
the police,

01:01:52.827 --> 01:01:53.862
I mean?

01:01:54.137 --> 01:01:55.620
was a total freak accident.

01:01:55.827 --> 01:01:57.034
Good idea. Yes.

01:01:57.137 --> 01:01:59.275
We go and tell the police that
you accidentally shot a man

01:01:59.379 --> 01:02:01.931
whilst we were planning to rob
a club, armed.

01:02:05.103 --> 01:02:06.965
I-- I can't go to jail.

01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.482
Okay. Well?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.620
we can't just leave him out
here to rot in the middle of fucking nowhere, so?

01:02:13.103 --> 01:02:15.068
I think we should just bury
him.

01:02:15.689 --> 01:02:17.344
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:17.448 --> 01:02:18.793
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:24.275
<i>If you're up there watching</i>
<i>all this, Mike,</i>

01:02:24.862 --> 01:02:26.655
I'm glad we found each other
again.

01:02:27.758 --> 01:02:29.517
I'm sorry we're gonna miss the
prom.

01:02:31.379 --> 01:02:32.379
Like you said?

01:02:33.379 --> 01:02:34.724
it's just life, I guess.

01:02:36.241 --> 01:02:37.241
And I am?

01:02:38.068 --> 01:02:39.379
real sorry

01:02:40.241 --> 01:02:41.689
for shooting you, Mike.

01:02:43.103 --> 01:02:45.034
Although, I swear

01:02:45.137 --> 01:02:47.172
this had to do with a transit
in your eighth house

01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:49.689
when Saturn converged with
Venus within the moon nodes

01:02:49.793 --> 01:02:51.275
and nothing to do with me,

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:54.310
or that bloody, stupid,
malfunctioning gun.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:56.862
which you did give me, Mike,
so?

01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:58.896
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

01:02:59.689 --> 01:03:02.137
That was from <i>Point Break?</i>

01:03:04.103 --> 01:03:05.137
but you knew that.

01:03:05.344 --> 01:03:06.448
Amen.

01:03:16.482 --> 01:03:19.689
And I thought this was really
it. You know?

01:03:20.206 --> 01:03:23.034
Like a real way
to change our lives forever.

01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:24.758
I needed the money.

01:03:26.241 --> 01:03:27.724
I don't know what I do now.

01:03:28.724 --> 01:03:30.344
Go back to work, I guess.

01:03:30.965 --> 01:03:32.310
Back to the grind.

01:03:34.068 --> 01:03:36.344
At least you guys have
something to go back to.

01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:38.034
I'm fucked.

01:03:38.137 --> 01:03:40.379
No, I can't go back to the club
now.

01:03:40.827 --> 01:03:43.344
I already had a whole new life
planned.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.103
Who says we have to?

01:03:48.068 --> 01:03:49.068
What do you mean?

01:03:51.172 --> 01:03:53.586
Why can't we go ahead
with what we had planned?

01:03:55.655 --> 01:03:57.241
And how do we do that?

01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:59.586
Because we all know what to do.

01:04:00.724 --> 01:04:02.551
And Jessica can take Mike's
part.

01:04:02.758 --> 01:04:04.241
I'll get the coats out of the
club.

01:04:04.344 --> 01:04:05.689
No one's gonna miss me

01:04:05.793 --> 01:04:06.965
because I'm not even there.

01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:10.172
Wait, do you really think
we can still pull this off?

01:04:12.931 --> 01:04:14.206
I think we have to.

01:04:14.931 --> 01:04:17.068
Mike's dead, and if we turn
back now,

01:04:17.275 --> 01:04:18.551
he died for nothing.

01:04:19.448 --> 01:04:20.827
I couldn't stomach that.

01:04:23.241 --> 01:04:24.517
<i>Kishi kaisei.</i>

01:04:33.448 --> 01:04:35.000
<i>- Kishi kaisei.</i>
<i>- Kishi kaisei.</i>

01:05:02.137 --> 01:05:03.172
Babe.

01:05:03.482 --> 01:05:04.551
Not right now, babe.

01:06:55.172 --> 01:06:56.275
Shit.

01:06:58.206 --> 01:07:00.310
Not this bloody gun as well.

01:07:03.655 --> 01:07:05.310
- The deal is off.
- It can't be off.

01:07:05.413 --> 01:07:06.758
The deal is off.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.655
Need to cancel the heist.

01:07:09.758 --> 01:07:11.793
Yakuza will not be pleased.

01:07:14.862 --> 01:07:16.000
Taxi.

01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:25.413
Damn, Nina.

01:07:31.896 --> 01:07:34.206
You wanna swipe right on Big
Boy Billy, baby?

01:07:35.793 --> 01:07:37.379
My God.

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:49.068
Right on time.

01:07:53.379 --> 01:07:55.620
My heart's pounding out of my
chest.

01:07:57.551 --> 01:07:59.620
We gotta stay cool.

01:07:59.724 --> 01:08:00.689
Agreed.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:01.827
What?

01:08:04.068 --> 01:08:05.137
Stay cool, sister.

01:08:23.275 --> 01:08:24.586
Jeanie in a bottle,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.034
in the Eyes Wide Shut show.

01:08:32.344 --> 01:08:33.655
You can do this.

01:08:35.137 --> 01:08:36.275
You can do this.

01:08:38.379 --> 01:08:40.586
This is the oldest you've ever
been,

01:08:41.482 --> 01:08:43.275
and you'll never be this young
again.

01:09:07.724 --> 01:09:09.000
We're going on in one minute.

01:09:16.689 --> 01:09:18.862
<i>All right, you horny bastards.</i>

01:09:20.482 --> 01:09:23.827
<i>Kubrick himself called it</i>
<i>dazzling.</i>

01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:26.103
<i>Give it up for Risqué's</i>

01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:28.413
<i>exclusive extravaganza.</i>

01:09:28.517 --> 01:09:31.517
<i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

01:10:03.724 --> 01:10:04.862
Yeah.

01:10:07.275 --> 01:10:09.310
Hello, hello, ladies.

01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:11.482
Y'all ready for a little Big
Boy Billy sex sandwich?

01:10:12.827 --> 01:10:14.310
Yo. Yo. What the fuck is this?

01:10:15.275 --> 01:10:16.241
Come on.

01:10:17.482 --> 01:10:18.551
What?

01:10:21.758 --> 01:10:24.482
"This is no joke."
"We don't want to hurt you,

01:10:24.586 --> 01:10:26.206
but play the hero and you will
die."

01:10:28.206 --> 01:10:29.413
So, what, there's no twofer?

01:11:00.241 --> 01:11:01.310
Carmen, all good?

01:11:01.689 --> 01:11:04.068
Yeah. Kiko and Shelby
are tying up Big Boy Billy.

01:11:04.448 --> 01:11:05.379
Bianka?

01:11:11.655 --> 01:11:13.241
What are you doing here?
Fucking show's on.

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:16.586
You gotta be kidding me.

01:11:22.758 --> 01:11:23.793
We good?

01:11:24.137 --> 01:11:25.413
He not going anywhere.

01:11:29.344 --> 01:11:31.034
We are really fucking doing
this.

01:11:31.137 --> 01:11:32.931
Yeah. It's all happening, baby.

01:11:35.586 --> 01:11:37.034
Who the fuck are you?

01:11:42.344 --> 01:11:44.172
At Folsom, they told me there's
a safe,

01:11:44.275 --> 01:11:45.965
a big, wide floor safe

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:47.448
<i>right under Karl's chair.</i>

01:11:50.586 --> 01:11:51.724
Where's the floor safe?

01:11:51.827 --> 01:11:53.620
Floor safe? What fucking floor
safe?

01:11:53.724 --> 01:11:55.103
The floor safe with the money.

01:11:55.379 --> 01:11:57.551
The money from the Peppermill
and the Eldorado,

01:11:57.655 --> 01:12:00.206
the liquor store, the drug
house. Cook Islands!

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:01.551
Ring a bell, asshole?

01:12:01.655 --> 01:12:02.896
Cook, what?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.103
I have no fucking clue
what you are talking about.

01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:06.310
The big, black bag.

01:12:06.413 --> 01:12:07.724
The big man with the black bag

01:12:07.827 --> 01:12:09.551
every third Saturday of the
month.

01:12:09.931 --> 01:12:11.000
You mean Harvey?

01:12:11.724 --> 01:12:13.862
He is my chiropractor, you dumb
bitch.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:17.724
Boy, do I need an adjustment?

01:12:17.827 --> 01:12:19.137
Let's fucking go.

01:12:22.275 --> 01:12:23.517
What the fuck?

01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:27.448
Jess, you are fucking dead!

01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:33.551
There's gotta be a floor safe.
Where's the safe?

01:12:33.655 --> 01:12:35.413
Millions from the Peppermill

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.413
and the Eldorado that you put
on a plane.

01:12:37.517 --> 01:12:39.689
A private plane to the Cook
Islands!

01:12:39.793 --> 01:12:40.896
Where is it?

01:12:41.413 --> 01:12:44.172
Listen to me, you desperate
piece of shit.

01:12:44.758 --> 01:12:46.517
Do you know how much fucking
uglier

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.896
this makes you look?

01:12:48.689 --> 01:12:49.758
There's a wall safe

01:12:49.862 --> 01:12:51.551
in Big Boy Billy's office.

01:12:51.655 --> 01:12:52.655
On a good night,

01:12:52.758 --> 01:12:54.551
it holds around 30 grand.

01:12:55.172 --> 01:12:56.655
Is that what you want, Jess?

01:12:56.758 --> 01:12:58.758
You desperate piece of nothing.

01:12:58.862 --> 01:13:00.068
Thirty grand.

01:13:01.241 --> 01:13:02.827
He said it was right here.

01:13:03.758 --> 01:13:05.034
Why would he say it was here?

01:13:11.586 --> 01:13:12.896
Some loser

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:17.172
puked up some silly sack
of crazy bullshit

01:13:17.275 --> 01:13:19.000
probably hoping to get laid.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:20.172
I'm sure you would.

01:13:20.413 --> 01:13:23.379
And you stupid fucking bitches
bought it.

01:13:29.068 --> 01:13:29.965
Shit.

01:13:30.068 --> 01:13:31.034
It's gotta be here.

01:13:31.724 --> 01:13:33.000
He said it was here.

01:13:38.379 --> 01:13:39.517
What'd she say?

01:13:40.655 --> 01:13:41.827
We're fucked.

01:13:48.206 --> 01:13:49.758
She said the deal was off.

01:13:50.068 --> 01:13:52.689
Don't trust her. Want to see
for myself.

01:14:03.655 --> 01:14:05.310
She said the deal was off.

01:14:06.137 --> 01:14:08.310
I don't trust that bitch.

01:14:13.413 --> 01:14:15.206
It was all bullshit, Jess.

01:14:15.482 --> 01:14:17.379
He was just in love with you.

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:20.000
Some creepy loser from high
school.

01:14:20.793 --> 01:14:21.724
No.

01:14:22.241 --> 01:14:23.551
No. What would be the point?

01:14:23.655 --> 01:14:25.965
Why would he do that? He
wouldn't do that.

01:14:27.103 --> 01:14:29.655
Crazy. Crazy. He crazy.

01:14:29.758 --> 01:14:31.379
Yeah. He's fucking delusional,
all right?

01:14:31.482 --> 01:14:33.448
Even worse than that asshole,
Big Boy Billy.

01:14:33.551 --> 01:14:35.241
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:14:35.931 --> 01:14:36.827
Wait.

01:14:38.758 --> 01:14:40.310
I know Mike was telling the
truth.

01:14:40.413 --> 01:14:41.275
I know it.

01:14:42.482 --> 01:14:43.827
We have to go, Jess.

01:14:48.965 --> 01:14:51.206
<i>Someone needs to take that</i>
<i>prick out.</i>

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:53.241
Yeah, but then we'd end up
with Big Boy Billy.

01:14:53.344 --> 01:14:55.620
And to be honest with you,
I dunno which prick's worse.

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:59.655
Still looking fucking sexy,
Jess.

01:14:59.758 --> 01:15:00.724
<i>Fuck him.</i>

01:15:01.034 --> 01:15:02.931
Just had to stomach
another delusional rant

01:15:03.034 --> 01:15:03.965
from Big Boy Billy.

01:15:04.793 --> 01:15:06.482
He's a crazy pig.

01:15:08.275 --> 01:15:09.896
<i>Es un cerdo loco!</i>

01:15:26.206 --> 01:15:28.965
<i>I'm just saying for an O.G.</i>
<i>veteran like yourself,</i>

01:15:29.068 --> 01:15:30.517
<i>you still hot as shit.</i>

01:15:30.896 --> 01:15:32.034
<i>It's a compliment.</i>

01:15:32.517 --> 01:15:33.655
<i>Gotta take it as such.</i>

01:15:33.758 --> 01:15:35.413
If your Uncle didn't own this
joint

01:15:35.517 --> 01:15:37.931
and kept you employed
out of some sad sense of pity,

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:40.344
God knows what freeway
underpass you'd be living under.

01:15:40.758 --> 01:15:43.241
Nasty, very nasty. But?

01:15:43.827 --> 01:15:45.827
I'm a key piece
of my Uncle's vast operation.

01:15:46.103 --> 01:15:47.448
I'm a mover and shaker, baby!

01:15:47.551 --> 01:15:50.000
And you're gonna regret not
fucking me when you had the chance.

01:15:50.827 --> 01:15:52.310
Now, you've made me nauseous.

01:15:56.655 --> 01:15:57.655
Hey, girl.

01:15:57.758 --> 01:15:59.379
You're late.
Karl was on the prowl for you.

01:15:59.482 --> 01:16:00.482
Fuck him.

01:16:00.586 --> 01:16:02.551
Just had to stomach
another delusional rant

01:16:02.655 --> 01:16:03.655
from Big Boy Billy.

01:16:03.758 --> 01:16:05.551
<i>This sour-pussed jack-off,</i>

01:16:05.655 --> 01:16:08.379
that my man called him, Sweaty
Pig.

01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:36.862
What if Mike had it wrong
'cause they got it wrong?

01:16:37.103 --> 01:16:38.034
Who?

01:16:38.137 --> 01:16:39.172
His cellmates.

01:16:39.517 --> 01:16:41.000
What kind of a nickname is
Sweaty Pig?

01:16:41.103 --> 01:16:42.241
What's that matter?

01:16:42.655 --> 01:16:44.000
What if it's Billy?

01:16:44.103 --> 01:16:45.724
- What?
- That makes no sense.

01:16:45.827 --> 01:16:47.655
We know it wasn't that big guy
with the beard.

01:16:47.758 --> 01:16:48.827
We know that for sure.

01:16:48.931 --> 01:16:51.310
But? there was this nerdy
looking guy.

01:16:53.793 --> 01:16:56.000
Shit. Yeah, with a backpack,
right?

01:16:56.344 --> 01:16:58.137
He's the mule with the cash.

01:16:58.241 --> 01:17:00.034
That's why he makes so many
trips here.

01:17:00.137 --> 01:17:01.206
He never got a dance.

01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:02.448
He never watched the show.

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:04.068
Because he wasn't there for the
show.

01:17:04.172 --> 01:17:05.517
He was there to see Billy.

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.724
I always just assumed he sold
him drugs.

01:17:08.379 --> 01:17:10.310
That safe is in Big Boy Billy's
room.

01:17:10.724 --> 01:17:11.827
I know it.

01:17:12.034 --> 01:17:13.655
He's the sweaty fucking pig.

01:17:14.034 --> 01:17:15.068
Sorry. The what?

01:17:19.724 --> 01:17:20.965
Jesus.

01:17:35.034 --> 01:17:36.000
My God.

01:17:40.172 --> 01:17:41.310
How did you know?

01:17:41.413 --> 01:17:42.310
Who told you?

01:17:43.586 --> 01:17:44.448
An old friend.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:47.551
Jessica.

01:17:47.758 --> 01:17:50.413
Big Boy Billy, AKA the Sweaty
Pig.

01:17:50.758 --> 01:17:52.413
What? Who said that?

01:17:52.896 --> 01:17:54.896
Never mind. The combination.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.689
- Now.
- Fuck you.

01:17:56.793 --> 01:17:58.103
We have no time for this shit.

01:18:00.413 --> 01:18:01.448
Fuck!

01:18:02.862 --> 01:18:04.275
You fucking bitch!

01:18:04.379 --> 01:18:05.620
You're dead.

01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:06.655
You're all dead.

01:18:06.758 --> 01:18:08.103
First one's in your stomach,

01:18:08.206 --> 01:18:09.724
the next one's in your throat,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.793
and the last one will be in
your head.

01:18:13.034 --> 01:18:14.000
The combination.

01:18:15.379 --> 01:18:17.655
Seventeen, 34, 45, 11.

01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:31.068
I know Mike wasn't lying.

01:18:31.655 --> 01:18:33.137
My God. You did it, Jess.

01:18:35.448 --> 01:18:36.689
Let's go, girls.

01:18:36.793 --> 01:18:38.068
Money. Money.

01:18:38.172 --> 01:18:39.827
Let's go. Let's grab it.

01:18:39.931 --> 01:18:41.344
I can't believe it.

01:18:41.586 --> 01:18:43.827
- Whoa!
- Pass me more cash.

01:18:43.931 --> 01:18:45.206
Okay. No!

01:18:47.172 --> 01:18:48.172
Okay.

01:18:50.103 --> 01:18:52.689
Give me more. Give me more.

01:18:52.793 --> 01:18:54.862
Bags. In the dressing room.
Come on.

01:18:54.965 --> 01:18:56.103
You bet, <i>chica.</i>

01:18:56.206 --> 01:18:57.793
- Yeah. Right with you.
- Let's move ass.

01:18:57.896 --> 01:18:59.448
Kiko, Carmen, Shelby.

01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:00.896
I know those voices.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.310
You won't get away with this.

01:19:02.724 --> 01:19:04.862
None of you will.
My uncle will hunt you down.

01:19:12.172 --> 01:19:13.068
Shit.

01:19:15.758 --> 01:19:17.482
You are the only one who knows
who we are.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:18.517
Fuck.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.586
Just you.

01:19:19.689 --> 01:19:21.172
Okay. Okay. Listen, listen,

01:19:21.275 --> 01:19:22.413
I take it all back.

01:19:22.517 --> 01:19:24.206
I hate my fucking uncle. Okay?

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:25.827
I won't say a word. I swear.

01:19:25.931 --> 01:19:26.862
Gun!

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:31.758
Christ.

01:19:31.862 --> 01:19:33.517
You're one cold, cool German
bitch.

01:19:34.448 --> 01:19:35.551
<i>Danke.</i>

01:19:35.655 --> 01:19:37.689
Girls, let's stash the guns
in Karl's office.

01:19:37.793 --> 01:19:39.068
- Come on.
- Good idea.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.482
Yeah, right with you.

01:19:55.517 --> 01:19:57.413
Stop. What the fuck are you
doing here?

01:19:58.862 --> 01:20:00.137
Walk away from the door.

01:20:00.655 --> 01:20:01.655
Fuck!

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:03.413
Out of the hallway. Now.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Shit.

01:20:15.827 --> 01:20:16.827
Shit.

01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:34.586
Fucking whores!

01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:52.103
Now. Now.

01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:54.655
Go. Go. Move it. Move it.

01:21:48.551 --> 01:21:50.379
What? A girl's gotta smell
good.

01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:54.344
Shit.

01:22:48.793 --> 01:22:49.862
Reno police!

01:22:54.275 --> 01:22:55.275
Hey!

01:22:55.379 --> 01:22:56.482
- Please, can I go?
- Go.

01:23:30.655 --> 01:23:32.137
Did that just really happen?

01:23:33.448 --> 01:23:35.344
It really just happened, all
right.

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.586
Are we really fucking rich?

01:23:37.896 --> 01:23:39.655
We're really fucking rich, all
right.

01:23:42.586 --> 01:23:46.689
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

01:23:47.862 --> 01:23:49.034
<i>Casablanca.</i>

01:23:49.137 --> 01:23:50.724
That's my mother's favorite
movie.

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:53.103
No, I made it up.

01:23:53.517 --> 01:23:54.793
It's from <i>Clueless.</i>

01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:56.827
No.

01:23:57.172 --> 01:23:58.241
It's <i>Top Gun</i>sequel.

01:23:58.862 --> 01:24:00.172
It's from <i>Top Gun</i>sequel.

01:24:00.413 --> 01:24:02.448
It's just a really good line.
All right?

01:24:02.551 --> 01:24:04.034
And I dunno about you lot,

01:24:04.137 --> 01:24:06.241
but I could use a bloody
vacation.

01:24:07.241 --> 01:24:08.586
How does Madrid Sound?

01:24:09.482 --> 01:24:10.724
Switzerland.

01:24:12.379 --> 01:24:13.517
Bali.

01:24:14.517 --> 01:24:15.655
Peru.

01:24:15.862 --> 01:24:17.689
How about a couple of months in
each?

01:24:17.793 --> 01:24:19.000
Yes, babe.

01:24:23.206 --> 01:24:24.551
<i>I may not believe in karma,</i>

01:24:24.655 --> 01:24:27.103
but I do believe things happen
for a reason, Jessica.

01:24:27.206 --> 01:24:29.896
If I can figure out a clean way
to snatch the dough,

01:24:30.103 --> 01:24:31.517
I hand over 20 percent

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.896
to the boys' families in
Memphis.

01:24:33.275 --> 01:24:34.310
Shit.

01:24:34.413 --> 01:24:36.655
Today is the oldest you've ever
been,

01:24:36.758 --> 01:24:38.482
<i>and you'll never be this young</i>
<i>again.</i>

01:24:39.931 --> 01:24:42.068
Just gotta make a quick stop in
Memphis.

01:24:46.413 --> 01:24:47.724
<i>Kishi kaisei!</i>

01:24:48.655 --> 01:24:51.000
<i>- Kishi kaisei!</i>
<i>- Kishi kaisei!</i>
