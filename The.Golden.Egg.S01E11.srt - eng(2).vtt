SERIAL MYSTERIOUS DEATHS

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:23.495
The year is almost over.

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:26.931
Time has flown by
since I was transferred in April.

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:31.302
You must hate me because it's my fault

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:34.906
that you had to transfer.

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:36.875
What? Why?

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:38.143
I don't hate you.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.912
People get transferred all the time.

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:45.016
But I never imagined
I'd be placed on the Sengoku Weekly,

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:49.621
working on such a big story
like the mysterious deaths case.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.129
I have to go to a meeting now.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.933
Good luck editing the novel!

00:01:06.704 --> 00:01:07.539
Huh?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.208
Ms. Shinoda.

00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:17.749
Mr. Aoshiro?

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:19.017
Why are you here?

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.355
Do you think that I did this?

00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:26.925
No, I'm not sure yet.

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:30.728
I was overseas
when the second death occurred.

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:32.497
I have an alibi.

00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:39.537
Besides, why would someone
who's all clean have to kill anyone?

00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:43.775
But you did some questionable things
behind the scenes back in the day.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.347
You mean this?

00:01:51.683 --> 00:01:53.818
Just between us,

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:57.956
everyone who got in his way
met a tragic fate.

00:01:58.022 --> 00:01:59.657
Give that back! It belongs to--

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:00.858
Tell me, Ms. Shinoda.

00:02:03.294 --> 00:02:04.195
You'll trust me,

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:08.533
won't you?

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:11.836
Mr. Aoshiro.

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:17.508
Hey, you.

00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:21.779
Kubozuka?

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.916
Are you the one saying that I did this?

00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:26.818
No, I'm not!

00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:29.721
The police put you on a wanted list!

00:02:29.787 --> 00:02:33.891
But in your hometown of Niigata,
people said you were a good guy.

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:37.328
I'm just trying to find out the truth!

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:40.531
Which is the real you?

00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:45.470
Please say something!

00:02:47.138 --> 00:02:48.773
Then let me ask you.

00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:57.849
I haven't seen you since the mixer.

00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:01.886
So you're Harue Komiyama's nephew.

00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:03.488
Atsuhiro Imamura.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.628
You're saying I'm guilty?

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:15.833
There's testimony that Ms. Komiyama
met with Kubozuka before her death.

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:22.240
But was the person you met
really Harue Komiyama?

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:24.742
What are you saying?

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:28.913
I heard you had a shady hobby.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.784
Could it be crossdressing?

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:38.823
If so, then perhaps you were the one
Kubozuka met at the cave bar,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.059
after which you killed Ms. Komiyama

00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:44.228
and framed it on Kubozuka?

00:03:45.063 --> 00:03:48.833
You're just a tabloid reporter,
not the police. What are you doing?

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:01.479
How about you drop out
of this investigation already?

00:04:02.814 --> 00:04:05.650
Is this job worth risking your life for?

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:08.986
Stay out of it.

00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:11.622
Just leave it to the police.

00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:22.834
No!

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.136
There's a role for tabloids to play!

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:42.954
I've decided to bring the missing
Madoka Hashimoto

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.757
back to this bear and her mother.

00:04:45.823 --> 00:04:48.359
Where is Madoka now?

00:04:49.827 --> 00:04:50.962
Stay away!

00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:54.665
Huh?

00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:12.250
It opened?

00:05:13.518 --> 00:05:15.253
Help me!

00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:18.656
Is anyone here?

00:05:26.097 --> 00:05:28.866
DANGER! BEWARE OF BEARS

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:36.073
The Truth Weekly?

00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:44.015
What?

00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:48.553
SENGOKU WEEKLY INCIDENT TEAM ATTACKED!

00:05:55.126 --> 00:05:57.228
A GRUDGE AGAINST TABLOIDS!

00:06:04.235 --> 00:06:05.336
Mr. Kitahama?

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.505
Are you okay?

00:06:08.372 --> 00:06:10.341
It's all over for tabloids!

00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:13.945
It's not worth risking your life for.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.385
Sengoku Weekly is hereby discontinued!

00:06:22.753 --> 00:06:24.989
It's what the world wants.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.924
What about the case?

00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:29.694
Leave it to the police!

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.297
What about the hidden truth
the police can't act on?

00:06:33.364 --> 00:06:35.900
Are we just going to ignore it?

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:37.201
We have novels!

00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:41.205
We can make our mark through stories.

00:06:41.272 --> 00:06:43.274
It's much slower than tabloids.

00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:44.208
In that case.

00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:47.345
There's social media!

00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:52.049
People with a strong sense of justice
will expose the world's darkness.

00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:55.186
What if they make those posts
without investigating?

00:06:55.253 --> 00:06:57.488
-Everyone would believe them!
-Then!

00:06:58.489 --> 00:07:00.258
You decide as the lone survivor.

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:04.795
Think hard about what you're going to do.

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:06.264
Listen.

00:07:07.231 --> 00:07:09.934
There are three important things.

00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:14.639
Mr. Kitahama?

00:07:15.473 --> 00:07:16.741
Mr. Kitahama!

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:17.808
Mr. Kitahama!

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:19.544
You can't do that!

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.013
At least tell me one of them!

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:24.348
What should I do?

00:07:24.415 --> 00:07:25.883
Mr. Kitahama!

00:07:26.517 --> 00:07:28.486
Mr. Kitahama!

00:07:28.553 --> 00:07:31.389
Mr. Kitahama!

00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:39.697
ATSUHIRO IMAMURA

00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:43.534
Mr. Kitahama?

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.841
-Hi everyone.
-We're back.

00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:53.177
Good news, you two.

00:07:53.244 --> 00:07:54.078
How'd it go?

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.181
Jackpot.

00:07:57.248 --> 00:07:59.650
We found the crossdressers' bar
Imamura went to.

00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:01.118
Here he is, dressed as a woman.

00:08:35.152 --> 00:08:39.390
There's a possibility that
the wanted fugitive Kota Kubozuka

00:08:39.457 --> 00:08:42.560
was framed
for the serial mysterious deaths.

00:08:42.627 --> 00:08:45.529
But there's no definitive proof yet.

00:08:45.596 --> 00:08:48.966
We have to find some evidence
by Tuesday night

00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:50.668
to make it for the next issue.

00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:56.040
Or else the Truth Weekly will run
their story on Aoshiro and beat us.

00:08:56.674 --> 00:08:57.742
Three more days.

00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:03.214
I have a call.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.016
-You can answer.
-Sorry.

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:07.785
Hello?

00:09:08.486 --> 00:09:11.088
Hello, Hinako Shinoda?

00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:14.291
It's Yanagishita from Niigata.

00:09:14.992 --> 00:09:16.093
Niigata?

00:09:21.499 --> 00:09:22.533
Ms. Yanagishita!

00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:25.302
It's good to hear from you.

00:09:25.803 --> 00:09:27.204
How are you?

00:09:28.005 --> 00:09:32.977
Remember how you left us money
and a polite hand-written letter?

00:09:33.044 --> 00:09:35.446
You didn't need to do that.

00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:38.249
Please, you did so much for me.

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:41.952
Are you still working for that tabloid?

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:43.454
I am!

00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:48.092
Then I have a favor to ask.

00:09:49.126 --> 00:09:51.762
You came to visit
Mr. Watanabe's home, right?

00:09:52.496 --> 00:09:53.364
Yes.

00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:58.102
When I told Mr. Watanabe about you,
he was surprised at first,

00:09:58.703 --> 00:10:00.371
but then I just got a call.

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:04.341
He said he wanted to talk
to a Sengoku Weekly reporter.

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:11.549
He said he wants to
meet with you directly.

00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:16.454
So would you mind giving him a call
if I give you his number?

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:20.925
I'm sorry, could you hold for one second?

00:10:23.294 --> 00:10:25.229
It's the woman I met in Niigata.

00:10:25.296 --> 00:10:30.301
Apparently, Kubozuka's guardian,
Mr. Watanabe wants to talk.

00:10:31.168 --> 00:10:32.636
Is it okay to get his number?

00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:34.305
-Do it!
-Of course!

00:10:36.974 --> 00:10:38.342
Thank you for waiting.

00:10:39.143 --> 00:10:41.045
I'd love to talk to him.

00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:44.682
Really? That's great!

00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.952
I'll let Mr. Watanabe know.

00:10:48.018 --> 00:10:48.919
Okay.

00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:51.422
Do you have something to write with?

00:10:51.489 --> 00:10:52.323
One second.

00:11:04.502 --> 00:11:05.569
Go ahead.

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:25.990
I'm the guardian who took Kota Kubozuka in

00:11:26.056 --> 00:11:29.660
after he was put on house arrest
for assault.

00:11:29.727 --> 00:11:31.929
Yes, we are aware.

00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:35.733
First, I'd like to know

00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:42.139
if the Sengoku Weekly would immediately
let the police in on it

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.209
if they're contacted by a fugitive?

00:11:47.244 --> 00:11:48.078
Huh?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.949
Normally, you would, right?
To inform them.

00:11:52.016 --> 00:11:53.584
Most people would think that.

00:11:54.218 --> 00:11:59.657
But would the Sengoku Weekly prioritize
the story over helping the police?

00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:05.429
-Um--
-We do.

00:12:08.032 --> 00:12:09.266
We have our priorities.

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:10.267
Mr. Kitahama!

00:12:10.935 --> 00:12:15.639
We would prioritize the story
over reporting anything to the police.

00:12:19.043 --> 00:12:20.344
I see.

00:12:24.582 --> 00:12:27.218
If you promise not to report it
right away,

00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:28.485
I have a proposal.

00:12:29.286 --> 00:12:30.287
You have my word.

00:12:30.888 --> 00:12:31.722
What is it?

00:12:34.558 --> 00:12:38.262
Kota Kubozuka says he's been framed.

00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:45.703
But he's a wanted fugitive.

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:49.874
He thinks if he's caught by the police
now, they'll surely pin it on him.

00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:52.610
I know him well.

00:12:53.444 --> 00:12:54.979
He's a good guy.

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:57.081
He might lose his temper and get violent,

00:12:57.147 --> 00:12:59.283
but he's not the type of guy
to kill someone.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.353
So you're in contact with Mr. Kubozuka.

00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:04.521
Yes. Just over the phone.

00:13:05.823 --> 00:13:09.760
He was surprised when I told him
a tabloid came looking for me.

00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:14.632
Maybe he remembered that,
because I got a call yesterday.

00:13:14.698 --> 00:13:15.766
What did he say?

00:13:17.334 --> 00:13:21.538
He asked if the Sengoku Weekly
would listen to his side of the story.

00:13:29.013 --> 00:13:29.914
Of course.

00:13:30.547 --> 00:13:32.549
We'd be honored to handle it.

00:13:33.617 --> 00:13:36.120
All the more if he's innocent.

00:13:37.755 --> 00:13:38.756
Really?

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.692
You won't be arrested for it?

00:13:43.827 --> 00:13:45.863
You won't back out for sales?

00:13:46.964 --> 00:13:48.098
It's okay, right?

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:50.601
Don't worry.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.705
Please leave it to us!

00:14:02.479 --> 00:14:04.682
What time and place?

00:14:04.748 --> 00:14:06.450
We're flexible.

00:14:06.517 --> 00:14:10.854
If he wants somewhere private,
we have a reception room at the office.

00:14:10.921 --> 00:14:12.790
We could use that.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.326
I'll send in Kubozuka alone.

00:14:15.392 --> 00:14:16.226
Okay.

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:17.661
We'll pick him up by car.

00:14:18.862 --> 00:14:20.931
Thank you very much.

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.634
-Thank you.
-Of course.

00:14:25.669 --> 00:14:27.004
Thank you.

00:14:27.738 --> 00:14:28.572
Of course!

00:14:31.442 --> 00:14:34.278
We got a big one!

00:14:34.345 --> 00:14:35.946
-Nice work.
-Thank you both, too.

00:14:36.013 --> 00:14:38.048
You sure about dropping Aoshiro's tail?

00:14:38.115 --> 00:14:40.084
We got a bigger tip.

00:14:42.252 --> 00:14:43.654
You okay, Shinoda?

00:14:44.254 --> 00:14:47.024
I'm all out of gas after this.

00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:49.126
You were really fired up.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.628
-We're back.
-Okay.

00:14:51.695 --> 00:14:53.430
-Good work.
-Good work.

00:14:53.497 --> 00:14:55.466
How how did it go with the guardian?

00:14:55.532 --> 00:14:57.735
Okay, we're all here.

00:14:57.801 --> 00:14:58.736
Listen up.

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:00.404
Don't be shocked.

00:15:01.105 --> 00:15:03.774
The Sengoku Weekly's story for next issue

00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:07.845
is an exclusive interview
with a wanted fugitive!

00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:10.180
-Wow!
-For real?

00:15:10.247 --> 00:15:11.115
Great job.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.717
How about you?

00:15:14.284 --> 00:15:19.590
We talked to a witness who saw someone
resembling Kubozuka.

00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:23.527
He said the man was shopping at
a convenience store with a young girl.

00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:24.995
A young girl?

00:15:25.596 --> 00:15:27.965
MADOKA HASHIMOTO

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:30.834
I had the same thought.

00:15:31.435 --> 00:15:34.138
I asked the clerk to call me
if they see them again.

00:15:34.938 --> 00:15:37.374
That means Madoka Hashimoto
is alive, right?

00:15:37.441 --> 00:15:38.475
I hope so.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.079
Okay, okay!

00:15:42.146 --> 00:15:43.113
In any case,

00:15:44.248 --> 00:15:45.282
let's eat!

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.952
Shinoda, Akutsu, could you go
on a food run and get some meals?

00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:50.320
-Really?
-Okay.

00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:52.122
Thank you, sir!

00:15:54.124 --> 00:15:55.192
One more?

00:15:57.161 --> 00:15:58.028
Thank you!

00:15:58.095 --> 00:15:59.696
-We'll be back!
-Later!

00:15:59.763 --> 00:16:01.632
-How much?
-Just 15,000 yen!

00:16:01.698 --> 00:16:03.467
Seems like too much.

00:16:10.107 --> 00:16:12.476
You went to meet Madoka's mother, right?

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.079
-Yeah.
-You know what I think?

00:16:15.712 --> 00:16:19.416
That visit gave her a reason
to call her daughter.

00:16:20.951 --> 00:16:22.920
Kubozuka is claiming to be innocent,

00:16:22.986 --> 00:16:26.156
and Madoka is staying with him
because she believes him.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.892
I think her mother knew about it.

00:16:30.027 --> 00:16:34.965
I don't know what happened between mom
and daughter, but I guess they'd call.

00:16:35.566 --> 00:16:37.868
But he's a wanted fugitive.

00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:43.273
She's worried something bad would happen
if she reported them.

00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:45.976
She probably didn't know what to do.

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:50.747
And just at that point,
a tabloid reporter showed up.

00:16:51.315 --> 00:16:56.687
She probably never considered that anyone
would choose not to report it.

00:16:57.488 --> 00:16:59.790
Mr. Watanabe said the same.

00:17:00.357 --> 00:17:02.759
This is going to sound conceited, but…

00:17:03.494 --> 00:17:06.396
a tabloid like us made a breakthrough.

00:17:08.832 --> 00:17:13.971
It made me feel like we did something
useful for the first time.

00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:20.077
I was having serious second thoughts
when we were staking out the cemetery.

00:17:21.478 --> 00:17:22.613
You too?

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:23.780
I felt the same.

00:17:23.847 --> 00:17:25.449
Yeah? I mean, you would right?

00:17:25.516 --> 00:17:26.450
Totally.

00:17:27.784 --> 00:17:28.919
Like the Philippines?

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.888
Okay, go with that.

00:17:30.954 --> 00:17:31.989
We're back.

00:17:32.756 --> 00:17:33.790
-Nice.
-We got it.

00:17:33.857 --> 00:17:34.691
Thanks.

00:17:34.758 --> 00:17:36.059
What are you doing?

00:17:37.494 --> 00:17:40.964
The Sengoku Weekly will be
launching a camouflage tactic.

00:17:42.032 --> 00:17:43.033
What's that?

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.069
We're setting up a dummy trail
so the Truth Weekly

00:17:46.136 --> 00:17:48.639
doesn't find out about our interview
with Kubozuka.

00:17:48.705 --> 00:17:49.540
A dummy?

00:17:49.606 --> 00:17:54.077
If they sense us backing off of Aoshiro,
they'll suspect we have something bigger.

00:17:54.778 --> 00:17:57.314
So we thought it's better to mislead them.

00:17:57.881 --> 00:18:01.485
Like "Kota Kubozuka Escapes Overseas"
or something.

00:18:01.552 --> 00:18:04.488
We're coordinating with locals
to make them believe

00:18:04.555 --> 00:18:06.390
Kubozuka has fled overseas.

00:18:06.957 --> 00:18:08.492
That's great teamwork.

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:12.062
The question is, who do we say
went overseas?

00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:14.631
Someone will have to come
to work in disguise.

00:18:14.698 --> 00:18:16.967
Who's good at lying low?

00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:28.912
Go have some fun overseas!

00:18:28.979 --> 00:18:30.214
You leave tomorrow!

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.848
You mean, I'm just pretending, right?

00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:33.584
-But be in disguise.
-Really?

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.386
-Don't get caught by the Truth.
-I'll try not to.

00:18:36.453 --> 00:18:38.055
Your disguise will be comped.

00:18:39.089 --> 00:18:40.090
Seriously?

00:18:40.157 --> 00:18:42.226
-They sell curly wigs at Donki.
-Stop making fun of me.

00:18:42.292 --> 00:18:43.260
Is this revenge?

00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:45.095
Come on, let's eat!

00:18:45.162 --> 00:18:46.563
-Yes, let's!
-Hold on.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.698
Is this decided?

00:18:49.366 --> 00:18:50.400
Is it decided?

00:18:52.102 --> 00:18:53.136
I don't want to!

00:18:57.341 --> 00:19:00.777
The big interview would already come
the following day.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.012
TO BE CONTINUED

00:19:35.579 --> 00:19:37.714
Please tell us everything you know.

00:19:37.781 --> 00:19:40.550
Next thing I knew,
I was a wanted fugitive.

00:19:40.617 --> 00:19:42.753
Mom, I…

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.455
If that's what you decided,
you have my support.

00:19:45.522 --> 00:19:47.591
Mr. Kitahama, breaking news!

00:19:48.692 --> 00:19:49.526
Okay!

00:19:49.593 --> 00:19:50.994
