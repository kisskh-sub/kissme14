DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:51.865 --> 00:00:52.740
FINALE

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:54.367
You haven't texted me all day.

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:57.120
Here you are
just recording yourself again.

00:00:59.164 --> 00:00:59.998
Are you

00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:01.833
leaving already, babe?

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:03.877
I'll miss you so much through the night.

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:06.379
We can go home together.

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:08.715
I really want to go with you,

00:01:08.798 --> 00:01:10.675
but I still have a lot of work to do.

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:11.926
You should go home.

00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:13.803
Go first, okay?

00:01:13.887 --> 00:01:14.762
See you tomorrow!

00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:27.775
I'm going home first.

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:30.236
I'm really leaving.

00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:35.867
I just want to

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.286
chat and laugh with you every day.

00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:41.164
As soon as my mom's stuff gets sorted out…

00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:42.123
Did I really say that?

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:43.708
…I'm going to propose to you.

00:01:45.293 --> 00:01:46.294
I love you, Go Da-rim.

00:02:58.616 --> 00:02:59.659
The next item on the agenda

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:01.744
is the motion to appoint
Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok

00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:03.121
as vice president.

00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:06.249
We assume you've reviewed
the materials provided outlining

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:10.461
his qualifications and the rationale
for his appointment as vice president.

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.839
We will now proceed to the vote.

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:14.841
Just a moment.

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:23.808
Before proceeding,
I'd like to present a new agenda item.

00:03:31.024 --> 00:03:32.692
ITEM NO. 1: MOTHER TF TEAM LEADER GONG'S
APPOINTMENT TO VICE PRESIDENT

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:36.404
A major incident occurred
at Natural BeBe recently.

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:37.905
Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.616
had been romantically involved
with his subordinate,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.619
and he overlooked the fact that
she lied to secure her position.

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:46.706
That subordinate turned out
to be a corporate spy,

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:50.376
and she leaked details of our new product
to a competitor.

00:03:57.717 --> 00:03:59.427
Even with that knowledge,
Chairman Gong Chang-ho

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.346
covered up the incident

00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:03.514
to protect his son.

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.602
To the shareholders watching online,

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.021
this is the true nature of these two men.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:12.899
That's not all.

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:16.361
Chairman Gong misappropriated
funds for personal use,

00:04:16.444 --> 00:04:19.155
committing serious embezzlement
and breaching his fiduciary duty.

00:04:19.697 --> 00:04:21.949
Furthermore, he has a history
of abusing his wife, Kim In-ae,

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:25.244
who's also one of the company founders
and former executive director,

00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:28.206
going so far as to confine her
in a psychiatric hospital.

00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:33.378
On the screen, you'll see the evidence
supporting these statements.

00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:35.671
PATIENT NAME: KIM IN-AE
GUARDIAN NAME: GONG CHANG-HO

00:04:59.612 --> 00:05:00.947
She prepared it so thoroughly.

00:05:03.366 --> 00:05:06.202
Therefore, I'd like to propose
a special vote regarding the dismissal

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:09.872
of Chairman Gong Chang-ho
and Mother TF Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:12.208
Please cast your votes now.

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:38.025
IN FAVOR: 91%

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:39.610
VOTE RESULTS

00:05:41.988 --> 00:05:44.699
That satisfies the two-thirds
vote requirement

00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:46.242
of the attending shareholders.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.334
Now, let's get in there.

00:05:57.712 --> 00:05:59.088
Careful.

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:03.634
Now, the rest of the shareholders
will cast their--

00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:08.723
-What's this noise?
-Jeez.

00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:11.601
Ms. Gong.

00:06:12.185 --> 00:06:14.228
I emailed the files to MomsJoy

00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.772
from Go Da-rim's account.

00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:23.988
It's Team Leader Gong.

00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:53.100
Everyone's gone for the day.

00:07:01.734 --> 00:07:03.444
SUBJECT: BABY CARRIER PROJECT
SENDER: GO DA-RIM

00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:05.738
MAIL SENT

00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:07.031
Ms. Gong.

00:07:07.114 --> 00:07:09.075
I emailed the files to MomsJoy

00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:11.619
from Go Da-rim's account.

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:20.378
The voice you've just heard belongs
to Ma Jong-gu, the marketing team leader.

00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:21.921
Damn it.

00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:23.506
And he was reporting

00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:25.508
to Director Gong Ji-hye.

00:07:33.766 --> 00:07:36.102
To slander my name,

00:07:36.185 --> 00:07:38.396
Ms. Gong intentionally leaked
company secrets to a competitor.

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.274
This is a blatant obstruction
of business operations

00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:42.608
and a breach of fiduciary duty.

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:45.570
I filed a formal complaint
against Ms. Gong

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:47.280
with the police yesterday.

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:53.369
Furthermore, Ms. Gong also has ties
to the fire that broke out

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:55.871
at the photography exhibition
held alongside Natural BeBe's campaign.

00:07:55.955 --> 00:07:56.956
I'd also like to let you know

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.667
that the police are currently
investigating the allegations

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.004
suggesting that Yu Tae-yeong,
Taeyu C&T's eldest son,

00:08:03.087 --> 00:08:06.591
may have been the mastermind
behind both these incidents.

00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:08.551
I only did what I was told to do

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:10.303
at the Taeyu Art Hall exhibition incident.

00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:13.139
I was going to be paid.

00:08:14.223 --> 00:08:16.976
I got the blueprints for the art hall
from Yu Tae-yeong.

00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:17.893
What's going on here?

00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:26.611
So?

00:08:26.694 --> 00:08:27.528
What now?

00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:30.114
That doesn't change the fact that
you were seduced by a woman

00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:31.574
and covered for her fraudulent employment,

00:08:32.283 --> 00:08:35.161
and that your father
committed embezzlement

00:08:35.244 --> 00:08:36.954
and breach of fiduciary duty.

00:08:37.455 --> 00:08:41.000
Neither you nor Chairman Gong
is qualified to run this company.

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:41.959
Got that?

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:44.879
By shares or by any measure,
this company belongs to--

00:08:44.962 --> 00:08:45.921
Yes, that's right.

00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:49.884
There's someone else more qualified

00:08:51.052 --> 00:08:51.969
to run this company.

00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:54.180
It's…

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:56.182
her.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.309
Hello, shareholders.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.355
It's been a long while
since I've stood before you.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.983
I'm the founding director of Natural BeBe,

00:09:48.609 --> 00:09:49.985
Kim In-ae.

00:09:55.074 --> 00:09:58.160
As Director Gong Ji-hye mentioned earlier,

00:09:58.786 --> 00:10:02.623
I've been the victim
of Chairman Gong Chang-ho's abuse

00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:04.208
for over ten years.

00:10:05.084 --> 00:10:06.127
And now,

00:10:06.752 --> 00:10:09.380
I've filed for a divorce.

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:13.509
Furthermore, Chairman Gong
has been using my health as an excuse

00:10:14.093 --> 00:10:15.636
to act as my guardian

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.848
and manage the company shares
that are in my name.

00:10:19.515 --> 00:10:20.474
I have also

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.770
filed a petition to terminate
the adult guardianship.

00:10:27.064 --> 00:10:30.109
This is a provisional injunction order

00:10:30.192 --> 00:10:33.738
that states the suspension
of Chairman Gong's duties as my guardian

00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:36.115
until the court makes its final decision.

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:39.368
In other words,
until the court makes its final decision,

00:10:39.452 --> 00:10:41.328
Chairman Gong
cannot exercise the voting rights

00:10:41.412 --> 00:10:42.913
on the shares under Ms. Kim's name.

00:10:43.456 --> 00:10:45.541
That is to say,

00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:47.877
due to insufficient voting rights
for a quorum,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.794
today's special vote…

00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:51.839
is null and void.

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:53.299
What? It's null and void?

00:11:05.978 --> 00:11:10.107
We apologize
for the confusion caused today.

00:11:10.691 --> 00:11:14.779
I will greet you again
as one of the major shareholders

00:11:14.862 --> 00:11:18.282
and an executive of Natural BeBe.

00:11:49.522 --> 00:11:51.732
Father, please allow me to explain.

00:11:56.737 --> 00:11:57.821
You idiot.

00:11:58.405 --> 00:12:00.032
This is why

00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:02.284
you'll always fall short of Ji-hyeok.

00:12:19.552 --> 00:12:21.136
-Tae-yeong.
-He's right.

00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:23.931
It's all because of that bastard,
Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:32.565
-Where are you going?
-I'll be off first.

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:41.073
Okay.

00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:46.912
Welcome.

00:12:54.712 --> 00:12:55.713
I'll take that one.

00:12:55.796 --> 00:12:58.048
You chose the prettiest one.

00:12:58.132 --> 00:12:59.466
The person I'm giving this to
is even prettier.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.593
My goodness, really?

00:13:03.804 --> 00:13:05.097
DA-RIM

00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:07.308
Hey, Da-rim.

00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:09.435
Ji-hyeok, did it go well?

00:13:09.518 --> 00:13:11.061
I'm on my way to you.

00:13:11.645 --> 00:13:13.147
Everything's okay, right?

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.189
Yes.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.359
Everything worked out, thanks to you.

00:13:18.694 --> 00:13:19.612
Thank goodness.

00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:45.387
Ji-hyeok?

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:46.639
DA-RIM

00:13:46.722 --> 00:13:47.973
Ji-hyeok?

00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:49.516
Hello?

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:51.602
Hello?

00:13:53.479 --> 00:13:54.313
Ji-hyeok?

00:13:54.396 --> 00:13:55.481
Ji-hyeok!

00:14:03.405 --> 00:14:04.573
Damn it!

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.129
Ji-hyeok!

00:14:19.213 --> 00:14:21.048
Please say something!

00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:22.257
Ji-hyeok!

00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:23.425
Ji-hyeok!

00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:31.827
WITNESS STATEMENT

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:35.164
So you're saying

00:15:35.247 --> 00:15:36.498
Mr. Yu Tae-yeong

00:15:37.249 --> 00:15:40.210
intentionally drove his car
into Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:41.211
Yes.

00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:43.922
And you witnessed it yourself?

00:15:44.006 --> 00:15:45.758
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:48.093
You're not exactly in a position
to have this attitude.

00:15:51.847 --> 00:15:54.266
A lot of complaints
have been made against you.

00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:56.935
For obstruction of business operations,
breach of fiduciary duty…

00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:58.854
You can talk about that later…

00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:03.150
with my lawyer.

00:16:04.902 --> 00:16:06.695
INTERROGATION ROOM

00:16:22.127 --> 00:16:24.963
Come on. Damn it.

00:16:26.256 --> 00:16:27.800
Ji-hye.

00:16:31.512 --> 00:16:32.763
Let's go.

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:33.680
Hey.

00:16:34.223 --> 00:16:35.099
Hey!

00:16:35.182 --> 00:16:37.142
What's that look on your face? Hey!

00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:38.936
What did you tell them?

00:16:39.895 --> 00:16:40.979
Hey, Gong Ji-hye!

00:16:41.063 --> 00:16:41.980
Go inside.

00:16:42.064 --> 00:16:43.982
-Get inside already!
-What the hell is going on?

00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:53.325
The police are investigating
Director Gong Ji-hye,

00:16:53.408 --> 00:16:55.035
and it doesn't seem like
it'll blow over easily.

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:59.164
Because Ms. Gong provided
a tremendous amount of evidence,

00:16:59.665 --> 00:17:00.958
it appears you'll also

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:03.877
have to be investigated for embezzlement.

00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:11.969
Why would I be investigated?

00:17:21.728 --> 00:17:23.188
It's a divorce agreement.

00:17:23.814 --> 00:17:25.691
On the condition that you relinquish
your guardianship over me

00:17:26.275 --> 00:17:28.235
and resign from the chairman position,

00:17:28.318 --> 00:17:32.906
I'll drop all the lawsuits
I've filed against you.

00:17:34.158 --> 00:17:35.284
You want to kick me out?

00:17:35.868 --> 00:17:37.911
After I kept a roof over your head
all these years?

00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:39.454
How dare you, you lunatic!

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.794
Even when your son
is on the verge of death,

00:17:46.712 --> 00:17:49.381
the only things you care about
are your assets

00:17:50.465 --> 00:17:51.925
and reputation.

00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:55.637
This is what's left of your life

00:17:56.555 --> 00:17:57.556
and the price you have to pay.

00:18:39.264 --> 00:18:40.349
-Da-rim.
-We're here.

00:18:43.852 --> 00:18:45.229
-Jin-hui.
-I can't believe this.

00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:53.445
Thanks.

00:18:54.404 --> 00:18:56.615
"I even had a whole wheat croissant."

00:18:57.199 --> 00:18:58.784
"With organic vegetables…"

00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:11.630
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:15.801
You've been in bed for a month.

00:19:18.178 --> 00:19:19.137
Aren't you bored yet?

00:19:20.764 --> 00:19:23.809
You should wake up
so we can have some fun.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.986
Hey, Sang-sik!

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.364
I'm doing well. How about you?

00:19:38.448 --> 00:19:40.409
You want to have a meal? Just you and me?

00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:42.035
Should we do that then?

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:02.931
Where are you?

00:20:04.808 --> 00:20:06.601
You're almost here, right?

00:20:08.353 --> 00:20:10.397
I promise to shave your beard

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.150
and wash your hair
for the rest of my life.

00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:17.446
So please just wake up.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.914
Ji-hyeok.

00:20:28.749 --> 00:20:29.833
Ji-hyeok.

00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:31.418
You just moved, right?

00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:33.378
Ji-hyeok.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.883
Doctor!

00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:41.887
Mr. Gong.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:44.806
Mr. Gong.

00:20:48.143 --> 00:20:49.436
Do you know where we are?

00:20:50.979 --> 00:20:52.981
Why am I in a hospital?

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.566
Did I

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:57.277
get into an accident
on my way to Jeju Island?

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.490
I don't have time to waste.

00:21:01.573 --> 00:21:03.909
Ji-hyeok, what do you mean by Jeju?

00:21:03.992 --> 00:21:05.410
What are you talking about?

00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:08.330
I have to meet someone important
for my business.

00:21:09.664 --> 00:21:10.791
His name is Kim Jeong-gwon.

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:13.710
Kim Jeong-gwon?

00:21:13.794 --> 00:21:14.836
By the way,

00:21:16.463 --> 00:21:17.422
who are you?

00:21:22.219 --> 00:21:25.055
It's a form of post-traumatic memory loss.

00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:32.771
The brain's ability to process
recent information was disrupted,

00:21:32.854 --> 00:21:35.816
leaving memories
close to the time of the accident

00:21:35.899 --> 00:21:37.150
damaged or inaccessible.

00:21:37.234 --> 00:21:38.652
Yes. Take a look.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.279
Right here.

00:21:42.364 --> 00:21:46.743
Then, when will he recover
those lost memories?

00:21:46.827 --> 00:21:50.455
He will regain them at some point, right?

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:53.917
You have to be patient and give him time.

00:21:57.838 --> 00:21:59.464
Take a look at this.

00:21:59.548 --> 00:22:02.134
I promise we're dating.

00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:04.511
See? We're linking arms and everything.

00:22:05.762 --> 00:22:06.930
Look, a cheek heart.

00:22:07.013 --> 00:22:08.890
This was a date at home,
and you're sending me hearts.

00:22:09.516 --> 00:22:10.350
That's impossible.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.728
You're not my type at all.

00:22:13.812 --> 00:22:16.731
I'm totally your type.

00:22:16.815 --> 00:22:19.234
You said I was cute when I smiled.

00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:23.697
Hey, lady. Are you trying to scam me?

00:22:25.407 --> 00:22:26.533
Did my father put you up to it?

00:22:27.117 --> 00:22:30.162
He's trying to get me
to move back home, huh?

00:22:30.245 --> 00:22:31.872
That must be it. I'm sure of it.

00:22:32.622 --> 00:22:33.874
Unbelievable.

00:22:33.957 --> 00:22:35.125
Get out of here!

00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:36.918
That's what he said to me.

00:22:37.002 --> 00:22:39.004
My goodness, how frustrating.

00:22:39.087 --> 00:22:42.382
Why does he only remember things
from just before he met us?

00:22:43.008 --> 00:22:45.343
Is there some way
we can help him regain his memories?

00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:49.890
Da-rim, are there any impactful memories
the two of you shared?

00:22:49.973 --> 00:22:51.558
-Impactful?
-Yeah.

00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:55.395
If we recreate the situation,
conversation, and mood of that memory,

00:22:55.478 --> 00:22:56.980
he might be able to remember.

00:22:57.606 --> 00:22:59.482
They do that in movies.

00:23:06.364 --> 00:23:08.575
He's coming. Get ready.

00:23:08.658 --> 00:23:10.952
Three, two, one. Go.

00:23:18.293 --> 00:23:19.669
-Oh no!
-Oh dear!

00:23:19.753 --> 00:23:21.379
-Gosh, what are we going to do?
-Oh no.

00:23:21.463 --> 00:23:23.548
The pregnant woman
dropped all her tangerines.

00:23:23.632 --> 00:23:26.134
I think she needs help.

00:23:26.218 --> 00:23:27.135
My back's aching.

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:29.471
-Goodness me.
-What are we going to do?

00:23:29.554 --> 00:23:31.890
Oh my, look at all those tangerines
on the floor.

00:23:31.973 --> 00:23:33.308
Should we pick them up together?

00:23:33.391 --> 00:23:35.518
My goodness. Look at this young lady.

00:23:36.102 --> 00:23:37.312
What a kind person she is.

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:39.648
-She's so kind.
-She's unbelievably sweet.

00:23:43.902 --> 00:23:45.570
-Thank you.
-Please take one.

00:23:45.654 --> 00:23:47.113
-Thank you.
-I appreciate it.

00:23:47.197 --> 00:23:48.990
What a kind soul.

00:23:49.074 --> 00:23:49.908
Right?

00:24:04.297 --> 00:24:05.548
I don't like tangerines.

00:24:17.894 --> 00:24:18.937
This is nice.

00:24:21.564 --> 00:24:23.942
-Ji-hyeok! Run!
-Damn it!

00:24:24.025 --> 00:24:25.318
Hey!

00:24:25.902 --> 00:24:26.861
Get him!

00:24:26.945 --> 00:24:28.530
-Hey!
-Hey, you in a patient gown!

00:24:28.613 --> 00:24:30.156
-Hey!
-What's going on?

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.116
You!

00:24:31.199 --> 00:24:32.951
-Hey!
-Get him!

00:24:33.034 --> 00:24:34.953
-We need to get out of here now.
-What's wrong?

00:24:35.036 --> 00:24:37.455
Stop! Where do you think you're going?

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:38.623
Stop right there!

00:24:38.707 --> 00:24:39.749
Get them!

00:24:40.542 --> 00:24:41.418
Wait for me!

00:24:41.501 --> 00:24:42.919
Behind you!

00:24:43.003 --> 00:24:43.920
In front of you!

00:24:46.965 --> 00:24:48.049
Just stay here for a second.

00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:39.642
Ji-hyeok, do you remember anything?

00:25:40.643 --> 00:25:41.478
Yeah.

00:25:44.022 --> 00:25:45.440
I understand now.

00:25:45.523 --> 00:25:46.900
You do?

00:25:47.692 --> 00:25:48.526
Yeah.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:49.652
Ji-hyeok.

00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:53.073
You're in cahoots with them.

00:25:53.907 --> 00:25:55.617
What do you mean?

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.286
You're trying to con me
with these scammers here.

00:25:59.162 --> 00:26:00.789
No, that's not…

00:26:06.836 --> 00:26:07.796
What are you doing?

00:26:11.257 --> 00:26:12.342
Are you crazy?

00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:21.476
Take that thing out of your mouth
before you speak.

00:26:24.229 --> 00:26:25.063
Well…

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.866
I understand.

00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:41.162
It feels like

00:26:41.704 --> 00:26:43.957
I owe you a really big apology right now.

00:26:45.375 --> 00:26:47.252
But I honestly don't remember,

00:26:48.294 --> 00:26:50.338
so I don't know
what I should be apologizing for.

00:26:51.506 --> 00:26:53.341
And it's not like

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.552
I can date a stranger.

00:26:55.635 --> 00:26:59.889
I wasn't suggesting we go back
to the way things were immediately.

00:26:59.973 --> 00:27:01.224
I'm just asking you

00:27:01.307 --> 00:27:04.894
to let me stay by your side
until your memories come back.

00:27:04.978 --> 00:27:05.812
No.

00:27:05.895 --> 00:27:07.856
Truth be told,
based on what you've told me,

00:27:09.607 --> 00:27:12.318
I think things worked out for the better.

00:27:13.236 --> 00:27:15.405
-What?
-In your stories,

00:27:16.322 --> 00:27:17.949
I sound like I was suffering
from temporary insanity.

00:27:19.534 --> 00:27:20.743
It's as if

00:27:21.453 --> 00:27:23.163
I've finally come to my senses.

00:27:23.246 --> 00:27:25.248
What do you mean?

00:27:25.331 --> 00:27:27.250
Humans are independent creatures.

00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:29.752
They're at peak perfection
when they live alone.

00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:32.297
I'm sure we wouldn't have lasted.

00:27:32.922 --> 00:27:34.090
What dies faster

00:27:34.841 --> 00:27:36.384
than the head on a beer

00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:38.720
is love.

00:27:41.598 --> 00:27:44.058
So let's just end this here,

00:27:44.142 --> 00:27:46.478
and I hope you'll allow me to return…

00:27:50.106 --> 00:27:51.191
to my old life.

00:28:41.533 --> 00:28:42.450
Why did you do it?

00:28:44.744 --> 00:28:45.912
I trusted you.

00:28:46.704 --> 00:28:47.789
I loved you.

00:28:48.748 --> 00:28:51.835
I felt terrible
about your mother's passing,

00:28:52.752 --> 00:28:54.212
so I tried to do right by you.

00:28:54.295 --> 00:28:56.422
But how could you do this to me?

00:28:57.924 --> 00:28:59.676
Why did you do all this?

00:29:00.385 --> 00:29:01.761
That's why I did it.

00:29:06.432 --> 00:29:08.685
Because you treated me well
only after my mom passed.

00:29:09.811 --> 00:29:10.895
What?

00:29:14.816 --> 00:29:16.943
If you truly loved my mom,

00:29:18.278 --> 00:29:19.779
if you loved me…

00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:27.078
you should've come to us
when she was still alive.

00:29:28.246 --> 00:29:29.247
No.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.207
You should've never abandoned us
in the first place.

00:29:33.668 --> 00:29:35.837
You treated me well
because you felt bad for me?

00:29:39.257 --> 00:29:40.633
That's not love.

00:29:41.217 --> 00:29:42.343
That's self-pity.

00:29:44.262 --> 00:29:46.514
You pitied yourself after you lost love.

00:29:47.181 --> 00:29:50.852
And you just needed me around
for you to play the role of a tragic hero!

00:29:51.644 --> 00:29:52.687
You know why?

00:29:56.024 --> 00:29:58.693
Because you're selfish to the very core.

00:30:01.571 --> 00:30:03.239
Look around.

00:30:05.074 --> 00:30:07.493
Look around and see
who you have left by your side.

00:30:25.678 --> 00:30:26.846
Chairman Gong Chang-ho of Natural BeBe,

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.849
who's under suspicion of embezzlement
and breach of fiduciary duty,

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:32.310
has appeared at the police station
for questioning.

00:30:32.393 --> 00:30:35.480
Chairman Gong is suspected of embezzling
billions of won from the company

00:30:35.563 --> 00:30:37.649
to create a personal slush fund.

00:30:37.732 --> 00:30:39.192
The police are carrying out

00:30:39.275 --> 00:30:42.236
a search and seizure at his home
and office at Natural BeBe.

00:30:42.737 --> 00:30:43.905
Previously, Chairman Gong…

00:30:43.988 --> 00:30:46.032
He left this
before he left for the police.

00:30:46.115 --> 00:30:46.991
He signed

00:30:47.784 --> 00:30:48.701
the agreement.

00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:52.664
Thank you.

00:30:52.747 --> 00:30:56.209
And he told me
to pass on an apology as well.

00:30:56.292 --> 00:30:57.460
…was confirmed.

00:30:57.961 --> 00:31:01.297
It was further escalated when his son,
Gong Ji-hyeok, personally revealed

00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:02.924
this shocking truth.

00:31:03.007 --> 00:31:05.969
It was even revealed
that he had his wife, Kim In-ae,

00:31:06.052 --> 00:31:09.305
confined to a psychiatric hospital
for many years,

00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:11.307
adding to the growing controversy.

00:31:11.391 --> 00:31:12.225
The police…

00:31:12.308 --> 00:31:13.935
What's my afternoon schedule?

00:31:14.602 --> 00:31:16.729
-I'll go over it with you as we walk.
-All right.

00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:22.652
Hey.

00:31:22.735 --> 00:31:24.404
Where's the guard?

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.657
-Hey, guard!
-Goddamn it!

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.951
-Guard!
-Why is he so damn noisy?

00:31:30.034 --> 00:31:31.160
Guard!

00:31:31.744 --> 00:31:34.288
Just sleep
if you have nothing better to do.

00:31:35.832 --> 00:31:36.916
Do you know who I am?

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.669
Mind your own damn business
and sleep all you want.

00:31:39.752 --> 00:31:42.213
How dare you talk that way to our boss?

00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:44.257
Finally, a guard.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.884
Did you get in touch with my father?

00:31:46.968 --> 00:31:48.302
Hey, don't just walk away.

00:31:48.386 --> 00:31:49.303
What's your name?

00:31:49.387 --> 00:31:51.681
I'm going to have my father
fire you first, you punk.

00:31:51.764 --> 00:31:52.724
Get over here.

00:31:53.224 --> 00:31:54.392
Guard!

00:31:54.976 --> 00:31:57.061
I don't know what kind of rich family
you come from,

00:31:57.145 --> 00:32:01.691
but it clearly seems you've been cut off.

00:32:01.774 --> 00:32:02.900
What should we do about him?

00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:05.153
What do you think?

00:32:05.236 --> 00:32:06.654
We'll take our time

00:32:07.196 --> 00:32:08.364
and do our best

00:32:09.407 --> 00:32:10.408
to crush him.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.626
Why you little…

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.795
Go ahead and call your dad! Go on!

00:32:35.975 --> 00:32:36.851
Mom.

00:32:38.436 --> 00:32:39.604
I'm leaving now.

00:32:40.646 --> 00:32:41.481
I'm sorry.

00:32:42.523 --> 00:32:44.400
I can't even see you off at the airport.

00:32:44.984 --> 00:32:45.860
Don't be silly.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.279
I'm the one who's sorry.

00:32:48.988 --> 00:32:49.947
Not at all.

00:32:50.782 --> 00:32:53.201
There's enough going on here,
so it's better that you leave.

00:32:53.284 --> 00:32:56.579
You'll only get caught up in the mess
if you stay.

00:32:58.331 --> 00:32:59.791
Make sure to eat your meals, okay?

00:33:01.042 --> 00:33:02.168
You too.

00:33:02.251 --> 00:33:04.212
Did you tell Mr. Kim?

00:33:06.506 --> 00:33:07.507
Why would I?

00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:09.634
I'm off.

00:33:09.717 --> 00:33:10.718
No need to see me out.

00:33:23.022 --> 00:33:24.482
SEON-U

00:33:29.112 --> 00:33:31.280
-Hello, Mr. Kim.
-Ms. Yu.

00:33:31.364 --> 00:33:32.657
I'm really sorry, but where are you?

00:33:33.241 --> 00:33:34.492
I'm driving right now.

00:33:34.575 --> 00:33:35.660
Jun disappeared.

00:33:35.743 --> 00:33:37.995
What? Where was he last seen?

00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:39.247
I'm out of town for work,

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:40.915
so it'll take some time
for me to get back.

00:33:40.998 --> 00:33:42.416
Can you help me if you're still in Seoul?

00:33:46.212 --> 00:33:48.089
Jun! Kim Jun!

00:33:48.172 --> 00:33:49.090
Jun!

00:33:49.173 --> 00:33:50.133
JUN BABY STUDIO

00:33:50.216 --> 00:33:52.218
Jun!

00:33:52.301 --> 00:33:54.011
Jun!

00:33:54.595 --> 00:33:55.680
Kim Jun!

00:33:56.264 --> 00:33:57.098
Kim Jun!

00:33:59.475 --> 00:34:00.518
Hey, kids.

00:34:01.102 --> 00:34:02.937
Have you seen him anywhere?

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.605
-No.
-No.

00:34:04.689 --> 00:34:06.065
Have you seen him anywhere?

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:07.775
-No, I haven't.
-Me neither.

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:08.776
Jun!

00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:11.154
Kim Jun!

00:34:11.237 --> 00:34:12.155
Where is he?

00:34:12.238 --> 00:34:13.072
Jun!

00:34:18.494 --> 00:34:19.370
Jun!

00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:21.581
My goodness.

00:34:21.664 --> 00:34:22.665
Jun.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.835
Pretty lady.

00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:30.631
Are you okay?

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.302
Did you fall asleep here?

00:34:34.385 --> 00:34:36.929
Yes, I was playing hide-and-seek.

00:34:38.681 --> 00:34:40.266
You scared me.

00:34:42.935 --> 00:34:46.355
I was so scared
because I thought you had disappeared.

00:34:51.027 --> 00:34:52.570
No, it's okay.

00:34:52.653 --> 00:34:53.571
Don't cry.

00:34:53.654 --> 00:34:54.780
No, don't cry.

00:35:34.445 --> 00:35:35.404
You're up.

00:35:37.698 --> 00:35:39.367
He just fell asleep.

00:35:45.915 --> 00:35:47.291
Thank you.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.074
Ji-hyeok.

00:36:20.992 --> 00:36:22.576
I've completed the discharge procedure.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.995
You're good to go now.

00:36:24.078 --> 00:36:25.621
Okay, thanks for everything.

00:36:25.705 --> 00:36:27.039
You went through so much.

00:36:27.665 --> 00:36:28.499
Thanks for acknowledging.

00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:31.002
By the way, Ji-hyeok…

00:36:33.296 --> 00:36:34.422
about Ms. Go Da-rim…

00:36:35.506 --> 00:36:36.841
What about her?

00:36:36.924 --> 00:36:39.760
I know there's nothing you can do
about your memories not coming back,

00:36:40.344 --> 00:36:42.513
but she's still the one
who nursed you day and night.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.765
You were in bed for a whole month.

00:36:45.308 --> 00:36:47.393
You were only able to stay neat and clean

00:36:47.935 --> 00:36:49.270
because of her.

00:36:50.855 --> 00:36:52.481
So if you ever get the chance,

00:36:52.565 --> 00:36:53.399
be sure

00:36:53.899 --> 00:36:55.067
to thank her.

00:36:58.112 --> 00:36:59.030
Okay.

00:37:02.616 --> 00:37:03.951
Let's go.

00:38:16.899 --> 00:38:17.900
Why did you come back?

00:38:19.068 --> 00:38:20.861
It was so hard to let you go.

00:38:22.488 --> 00:38:23.656
Are you going to tell me to leave again?

00:38:24.782 --> 00:38:25.950
You should've asked me to stay.

00:38:28.828 --> 00:38:30.329
I know I shouldn't have.

00:38:32.873 --> 00:38:34.959
But I guess you came back
because I was waiting.

00:38:53.144 --> 00:38:56.021
Believe me. You're so lucky.

00:38:56.105 --> 00:38:59.650
The buyer loves the house so much

00:38:59.733 --> 00:39:02.027
that they're willing to pay
above market value.

00:39:02.987 --> 00:39:04.238
Yes, I'm glad it worked out.

00:39:04.321 --> 00:39:06.157
Oh, there they are.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.658
Hello.

00:39:12.455 --> 00:39:13.581
In-ae.

00:39:18.752 --> 00:39:21.464
You should've told us.

00:39:21.547 --> 00:39:23.883
I was so shocked.

00:39:23.966 --> 00:39:25.301
I was afraid you'd turn me down

00:39:25.926 --> 00:39:27.136
if I told you in advance.

00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:30.556
I really wanted to pay you back

00:39:31.348 --> 00:39:34.810
for what you did for me
when I was struggling.

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:37.271
What was there to pay back?

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.898
Thank you.

00:39:40.191 --> 00:39:41.484
Thank you so much.

00:39:43.402 --> 00:39:46.155
I have more good news.

00:39:47.114 --> 00:39:50.284
We won the baby carrier lawsuit.

00:39:50.868 --> 00:39:53.829
That's such good news. I'm so glad.

00:39:53.913 --> 00:39:57.333
MomsJoy is recalling all of its products,

00:39:57.416 --> 00:40:00.294
and our product
will officially be launched soon.

00:40:02.421 --> 00:40:05.508
The company has high hopes
for this new product launch.

00:40:06.383 --> 00:40:08.677
You know this is all thanks to you, right?

00:40:09.512 --> 00:40:10.888
I didn't do anything.

00:40:11.764 --> 00:40:12.806
Would you

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.976
consider rejoining the company?

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.274
No, I don't think that'd be right.

00:40:23.067 --> 00:40:25.194
But I really appreciate your offer.

00:40:25.736 --> 00:40:26.570
In that case,

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.949
how about starting a company of your own?

00:40:30.991 --> 00:40:32.201
Pardon?

00:40:32.284 --> 00:40:33.452
My own company?

00:40:33.536 --> 00:40:36.539
Mr. Kang and the other TF team members

00:40:36.622 --> 00:40:40.626
all told me how passionate
and talented you are.

00:40:41.335 --> 00:40:44.296
I can't lose such a talent
to another company, can I?

00:40:45.464 --> 00:40:48.008
If we can't be owner and employee,

00:40:48.092 --> 00:40:52.388
I thought investor and startup CEO
would be nice too.

00:40:56.809 --> 00:40:58.769
For the first investment,

00:41:00.271 --> 00:41:01.647
we'll start with this.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.150
You need a place to live

00:41:06.026 --> 00:41:07.611
to start working again.

00:41:07.695 --> 00:41:09.738
REAL ESTATE SALES CONTRACT

00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:13.284
Hold on a second.

00:41:13.367 --> 00:41:15.536
How can we accept this?

00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:17.788
How will we ever repay this kindness?

00:41:17.871 --> 00:41:19.498
There's nothing to repay.

00:41:19.582 --> 00:41:22.126
If Da-rim works hard,

00:41:22.209 --> 00:41:23.502
that's more than enough.

00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:34.930
All right. I'm sure Da-rim will work hard

00:41:35.514 --> 00:41:37.474
to show how much we appreciate this.

00:41:37.558 --> 00:41:38.434
Yes.

00:41:39.101 --> 00:41:42.271
I'm sure Da-rim will do well.

00:41:43.939 --> 00:41:47.401
Then I'll promise to give it my best shot.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.403
Thank you so much.

00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:08.631
Dad.

00:42:09.256 --> 00:42:10.466
We're back.

00:42:11.634 --> 00:42:12.718
Aren't you relieved?

00:42:14.678 --> 00:42:15.679
Do you think…

00:42:17.389 --> 00:42:18.932
I can do this?

00:42:30.903 --> 00:42:32.571
CEO KIM JAE-HYEON (PAPA FABRICS)

00:42:32.655 --> 00:42:34.114
Hello, sir.

00:42:34.198 --> 00:42:36.408
Yes, it's supposed to have two zippers.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.911
It's designed to open
from both the top and bottom.

00:42:38.994 --> 00:42:41.747
And remember that premium fabric
I mentioned last time?

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.958
-Let's proceed with that.
-Hey, I got some gizzard shad!

00:42:45.042 --> 00:42:46.460
-Okay, then I'll leave it to you.
-Let's eat!

00:42:46.543 --> 00:42:47.378
Bye.

00:42:47.461 --> 00:42:48.420
Let's hang this one.

00:42:48.504 --> 00:42:50.464
This one? Okay.

00:42:50.547 --> 00:42:51.882
Should we hang it here?

00:42:52.758 --> 00:42:53.634
Over here.

00:42:53.717 --> 00:42:55.052
-Here? You got it.
-Yes.

00:42:57.221 --> 00:42:59.014
Ta-da.

00:42:59.098 --> 00:43:00.140
All done.

00:43:01.934 --> 00:43:02.935
Jun, give me a high five!

00:43:03.727 --> 00:43:06.397
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.400
-Jun!
-Thank you.

00:43:09.483 --> 00:43:10.984
Let's open this later.

00:43:11.068 --> 00:43:13.362
-Should we blow out the candles?
-Good idea.

00:43:13.445 --> 00:43:15.698
-Let's blow them out.
-Sit here.

00:43:15.781 --> 00:43:17.241
There you go.

00:43:17.324 --> 00:43:19.660
-All right. One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

00:44:07.958 --> 00:44:08.792
Hello.

00:44:09.293 --> 00:44:10.210
1 YEAR LATER

00:44:10.294 --> 00:44:12.254
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:44:12.337 --> 00:44:14.173
Oh, hello.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.341
Bye. Oh dear.

00:44:16.842 --> 00:44:19.344
Okay. Let's see here.

00:44:19.428 --> 00:44:21.013
SANG-HUI

00:44:22.306 --> 00:44:23.432
Hey, Sang-hui.

00:44:23.515 --> 00:44:25.350
Hey, Da-rim. I'm in Jeju right now.

00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:27.311
Oh, you arrived.

00:44:27.394 --> 00:44:29.480
How's the weather?
Did you eat a lot of tasty food?

00:44:29.563 --> 00:44:31.607
Listen, I just sent you a picture.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:32.691
Can you take a look at it?

00:44:32.775 --> 00:44:35.694
The girl in the background
is your younger sister, right?

00:44:36.945 --> 00:44:38.530
What? Let me check right now.

00:44:38.614 --> 00:44:40.073
Thanks. Bye.

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.786
Hey.

00:45:25.869 --> 00:45:27.204
Are you all packed?

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:29.831
Yeah.

00:45:29.915 --> 00:45:31.416
You had a dress like that?

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.793
Oh, this?

00:45:33.502 --> 00:45:37.047
Someone gave it to me as a gift
the last time I was in Jeju.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:38.131
I see.

00:45:38.924 --> 00:45:39.925
Why are you taking that?

00:45:40.008 --> 00:45:43.011
Are you going to wear that
while looking for Da-jeong?

00:45:43.095 --> 00:45:44.846
No, I'm going to go back to the store
and get a refund,

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:46.598
even if it's half the price.

00:45:47.224 --> 00:45:49.101
It could pay off my plane ticket.

00:45:49.184 --> 00:45:50.227
As expected.

00:45:50.852 --> 00:45:52.938
You're so incredibly resourceful.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.734
I did a fine job
raising two amazing daughters.

00:45:57.818 --> 00:45:58.652
Two?

00:45:58.735 --> 00:46:00.362
Why are you including Da-jeong?

00:46:00.445 --> 00:46:02.447
She's hiding in Jeju
after all the trouble she caused.

00:46:02.531 --> 00:46:04.199
She's doing what she can to survive.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.534
What?

00:46:05.617 --> 00:46:07.911
She's still putting up a fight
without giving up.

00:46:08.453 --> 00:46:09.371
That's good enough.

00:46:10.372 --> 00:46:12.874
She's making an effort to survive,
so I'm not worried.

00:46:14.251 --> 00:46:15.877
What did I always tell you?

00:46:16.962 --> 00:46:17.879
What do you do if you fall?

00:46:18.463 --> 00:46:20.090
You just need to get back up.

00:46:20.173 --> 00:46:21.341
There you go.

00:46:22.301 --> 00:46:23.218
In life,

00:46:23.969 --> 00:46:25.470
that's all you need.

00:46:28.098 --> 00:46:28.932
Yeah.

00:46:49.745 --> 00:46:51.997
LEISURELY STROLL TOUR

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.665
LEISURELY STROLL TOUR

00:46:53.749 --> 00:46:57.002
We'll meet back here in 30 minutes.

00:46:57.085 --> 00:46:58.378
Please don't be late.

00:46:58.462 --> 00:46:59.546
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:47:02.215 --> 00:47:03.050
Go Da-jeong, you…

00:47:04.718 --> 00:47:06.762
-Who are you?
-I'm sorry.

00:47:11.183 --> 00:47:12.476
Da-jeong?

00:47:12.559 --> 00:47:14.144
-Who are you?
-Sorry.

00:47:14.227 --> 00:47:15.812
-Go Da…
-Sorry?

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.440
Sorry.

00:47:26.865 --> 00:47:27.783
Excuse me.

00:47:30.535 --> 00:47:32.829
By any chance,
are you looking for Ms. Go Da-jeong?

00:47:32.913 --> 00:47:35.082
You know my sister?

00:47:35.165 --> 00:47:36.792
Yes, she's a colleague.

00:47:36.875 --> 00:47:39.211
She's not working today. It's her day off.

00:47:40.295 --> 00:47:42.798
Then can I get her address?

00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:44.299
I don't know where she lives.

00:47:44.841 --> 00:47:47.302
You should try going to Golden Bay Hotel
later this evening.

00:47:47.386 --> 00:47:50.222
She works part-time there
as a server on her days off.

00:47:50.806 --> 00:47:52.265
I see.

00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:53.350
Thank you.

00:47:53.433 --> 00:47:54.476
Thank you.

00:48:56.705 --> 00:48:58.832
You can't enter without an invitation.

00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:00.375
Sir.

00:49:00.459 --> 00:49:03.795
I just need to go in for a second

00:49:03.879 --> 00:49:06.089
to check if my sister is there or not.

00:49:06.173 --> 00:49:07.924
I'll be very quick and quiet.

00:49:08.008 --> 00:49:11.678
I'll sneak in just for a second.
No one will even know I'm there.

00:49:19.936 --> 00:49:21.813
I guess I have no other choice.

00:49:22.814 --> 00:49:24.274
What will I tell

00:49:24.775 --> 00:49:26.443
my elderly mother?

00:49:26.526 --> 00:49:27.569
She just had heart surgery,

00:49:27.652 --> 00:49:30.947
and she's been waiting day and night
for my sister to come home.

00:49:31.823 --> 00:49:33.867
It must've been so hard for you.

00:49:35.577 --> 00:49:36.661
I know.

00:49:37.954 --> 00:49:40.916
I thought after all that suffering,

00:49:41.875 --> 00:49:44.544
I was finally
getting to see my sister again.

00:49:44.628 --> 00:49:46.546
But of course,
I don't have an invitation to the party.

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.507
But it's all right. It's fine.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:49.841
I'm really fine.

00:49:49.925 --> 00:49:51.218
Listen.

00:49:51.301 --> 00:49:54.262
I can overlook the fact that
you don't have the invitation.

00:49:55.013 --> 00:49:56.681
-But…
-But?

00:49:57.474 --> 00:49:59.351
Your outfit right now is a bit…

00:50:03.688 --> 00:50:06.566
You're saying I just need to wear
a dress like that, right?

00:50:07.484 --> 00:50:08.401
That's right.

00:50:24.292 --> 00:50:25.836
Where is she?

00:50:26.837 --> 00:50:28.004
Pardon me.

00:50:41.893 --> 00:50:42.936
Seriously.

00:50:53.029 --> 00:50:53.905
Ms. Go Da-rim?

00:50:55.407 --> 00:50:57.075
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:50:57.158 --> 00:50:58.159
What are you doing here?

00:51:00.161 --> 00:51:01.496
Did you follow me here?

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:02.914
What?

00:51:03.707 --> 00:51:04.958
No, I didn't.

00:51:05.584 --> 00:51:06.585
Then why are you here?

00:51:06.668 --> 00:51:09.129
What do you think? I'm here…

00:51:09.963 --> 00:51:12.757
I'm here to celebrate
the founding of the company.

00:51:14.634 --> 00:51:16.011
Name the CEO of this company then.

00:51:16.094 --> 00:51:18.179
Well, it's…

00:51:21.224 --> 00:51:22.100
I knew it.

00:51:23.226 --> 00:51:24.603
You did follow me.

00:51:25.061 --> 00:51:26.688
I clearly warned you last time.

00:51:26.771 --> 00:51:28.815
I told you I'd call the police
if this ever happened…

00:51:28.899 --> 00:51:31.318
And you should set up
a dinner for us in Seoul with Su-jin.

00:51:34.738 --> 00:51:36.114
I'm sorry.

00:51:36.197 --> 00:51:38.450
Jeong-gwon was walking toward us.

00:51:40.493 --> 00:51:42.370
Should we do that again?

00:51:45.206 --> 00:51:46.458
Are you okay?

00:51:47.083 --> 00:51:49.836
Seeing you is making my head hurt again.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.671
What? I didn't do anything.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.800
Anyway, I swear I'm not here for you,

00:51:55.884 --> 00:51:57.177
so don't worry.

00:51:57.969 --> 00:52:01.264
Let's each mind our own business.

00:53:05.996 --> 00:53:08.248
I didn't do that on purpose.

00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:09.708
It was an accident.

00:53:29.394 --> 00:53:30.228
Should we…

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:32.939
do that again?

00:53:35.233 --> 00:53:36.067
What?

00:53:36.818 --> 00:53:37.861
Let's…

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:41.948
do that again.

00:56:01.838 --> 00:56:03.089
Seriously?

00:56:03.673 --> 00:56:04.674
I'm sorry.

00:56:32.577 --> 00:56:33.494
Will you…

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:36.664
marry me?

00:57:22.168 --> 00:57:24.379
KIM SEON-U PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION

00:57:27.173 --> 00:57:29.717
A FEW YEARS LATER

00:58:49.047 --> 00:58:55.511
KIM SEON-U PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION

00:58:55.595 --> 00:59:00.266
My goodness. That's one handsome boy.
I wonder who he takes after.

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:01.392
He takes after me.

00:59:01.476 --> 00:59:03.436
Look at that sharp little nose.

00:59:03.519 --> 00:59:04.979
He must take after his dad.

00:59:05.063 --> 00:59:06.439
He takes after me.

00:59:06.522 --> 00:59:09.275
-Look at him moving around.
-I think he looks like his dad.

00:59:09.359 --> 00:59:10.860
-He's wriggling.
-Hello.

00:59:12.153 --> 00:59:13.237
You're finally back.

00:59:13.321 --> 00:59:14.197
How'd it go?

00:59:20.453 --> 00:59:22.538
Well, things don't always work out.

00:59:22.622 --> 00:59:25.333
Yeah, we'll try again next time
and get the deal then.

00:59:25.416 --> 00:59:26.709
Of course.

00:59:26.793 --> 00:59:28.961
Even monkeys fall from trees sometimes.

00:59:30.713 --> 00:59:31.547
What are you talking about?

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.218
We secured
the South American export contract.

00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:36.427
-What?
-No way.

00:59:36.511 --> 00:59:37.470
What was with the acting?

00:59:37.553 --> 00:59:40.181
-Let me see.
-You two can't mess with us like that!

00:59:40.264 --> 00:59:41.265
It's all in English.

00:59:42.558 --> 00:59:44.894
This is really happening, right?
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:59:44.977 --> 00:59:47.772
Yes, it's really happening. We did it!

00:59:49.649 --> 00:59:50.983
Congratulations, Ms. Go.

00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:54.070
Well done, everyone.

00:59:54.737 --> 00:59:56.656
Our team

00:59:56.739 --> 00:59:57.824
-really is the best!
-The best!

00:59:57.907 --> 01:00:00.660
I know it's been a while,
but should we do that?

01:00:00.743 --> 01:00:02.120
-Should we?
-Let's do it.

01:00:02.203 --> 01:00:03.871
-Bring it in.
-Bring it in!

01:00:03.955 --> 01:00:05.248
-Okay. Bring it in.
-Here we go.

01:00:05.331 --> 01:00:06.999
One, two, three.

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:08.876
-Dream & BeBe!
-Dream & BeBe!

01:00:16.676 --> 01:00:22.724
CEO GO DA-RIM

01:00:29.814 --> 01:00:32.024
Oh my. Look at them go.

01:00:32.108 --> 01:00:33.067
Oh my goodness.

01:00:34.068 --> 01:00:36.446
Who on earth do they take after
to be like that?

01:00:36.529 --> 01:00:37.739
Who do you think?

01:00:39.073 --> 01:00:40.074
What?

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:41.784
Of course, it's me.

01:00:47.081 --> 01:00:48.082
-I'm so good.
-But babe,

01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:50.960
instead of reading to them last night,

01:00:51.043 --> 01:00:52.628
you secretly played a game
on your phone, didn't you?

01:00:52.712 --> 01:00:54.046
No, I didn't.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:55.339
Don't lie to me.

01:00:56.174 --> 01:00:57.508
Honey.

01:00:57.592 --> 01:01:00.261
Don't you know they're at a really
important age right now?

01:01:00.344 --> 01:01:01.763
All right. I'm sorry.

01:01:03.473 --> 01:01:05.308
Kids, let's go eat.

01:01:05.391 --> 01:01:07.685
I'm serious here.

01:01:07.769 --> 01:01:11.355
The parents need to set a good example
for the kids to naturally learn from them.

01:01:11.439 --> 01:01:13.232
How many times have I told you that?

01:01:13.316 --> 01:01:14.776
You're so right.

01:01:15.318 --> 01:01:16.360
I'll be sure

01:01:17.403 --> 01:01:18.654
to never forget those words.

01:01:19.322 --> 01:01:20.239
All right?

01:01:21.073 --> 01:01:22.867
I'll be watching you, okay?

01:01:24.494 --> 01:01:25.536
Kids.

01:01:27.413 --> 01:01:29.457
This is all because of that darn kiss.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.792
My goodness.

01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:31.709
What?

01:01:31.793 --> 01:01:33.503
What's this about a kiss now?

01:01:34.295 --> 01:01:35.129
What?

01:01:35.755 --> 01:01:36.631
It's nothing.

01:01:37.507 --> 01:01:41.052
I think I just heard you say,
"This is all because of that darn kiss."

01:01:43.679 --> 01:01:44.514
You're right.

01:01:45.598 --> 01:01:47.225
It's all because of that darn kiss…

01:01:50.186 --> 01:01:51.771
that I couldn't be happier.

01:01:54.524 --> 01:01:55.358
I knew it.

01:01:55.983 --> 01:01:57.944
You just need to kiss first
and think later.

01:02:19.006 --> 01:02:20.049
There they go again.
