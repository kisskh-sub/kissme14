(Jinhua Hall)

00:01:15.237 --> 00:01:16.517
Jinhua Hall?

00:01:17.197 --> 00:01:19.077
Yuwen Que lied to me.

00:01:19.597 --> 00:01:21.357
This isn't my bamboo cottage.

00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:27.995
(Jinhua Hall)

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.282
(Jinhua Hall)

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:25.316
Who are you?

00:02:25.317 --> 00:02:26.438
Young Lady Shen,

00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:27.837
do you remember me?

00:02:28.558 --> 00:02:29.878
I'm Wen Ling.

00:02:33.878 --> 00:02:34.758
Young Lady Shen,

00:02:35.317 --> 00:02:37.318
you've been confined here
for a long time.

00:02:37.718 --> 00:02:39.917
Yuwen Que drugged your food

00:02:40.678 --> 00:02:42.158
and made you forget about everything.

00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:44.117
About General Su

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:46.637
and the massacre of your family.

00:03:32.797 --> 00:03:34.117
So it's all true.

00:03:34.558 --> 00:03:35.718
It wasn't a dream.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:37.677
It's all real.

00:03:40.077 --> 00:03:41.117
All of it.

00:03:41.637 --> 00:03:42.837
Changji.

00:03:43.797 --> 00:03:44.517
Mother.

00:03:45.797 --> 00:03:46.797
I shouldn't.

00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:50.077
I shouldn't have forgotten
what he did to you all.

00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:13.237
Ru,

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:15.278
is something on your mind?

00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:19.478
I was thinking

00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:23.238
what kind of flowers

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.558
are worthy of you, Che.

00:04:34.957 --> 00:04:35.837
Look.

00:04:36.478 --> 00:04:38.198
Doesn't it look like a crown?

00:04:39.397 --> 00:04:41.077
It's just

00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:42.717
missing a bit of blood.

00:04:48.517 --> 00:04:49.918
Why are you talking

00:04:51.678 --> 00:04:53.118
so strangely today?

00:04:57.598 --> 00:04:58.597
What?

00:04:58.837 --> 00:04:59.837
Che,

00:05:00.397 --> 00:05:02.077
you don't like the way I speak?

00:05:09.757 --> 00:05:11.077
I was wondering,

00:05:13.118 --> 00:05:14.517
when you ran your sword

00:05:15.317 --> 00:05:18.678
through my mother's chest, did it hurt?

00:05:19.317 --> 00:05:20.397
Ru.

00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:24.558
What? Feeling guilty now?

00:05:26.798 --> 00:05:28.238
Or are you afraid

00:05:29.637 --> 00:05:30.998
that I remember everything now?

00:05:31.038 --> 00:05:31.798
Ru,

00:05:31.918 --> 00:05:32.837
hear me out.

00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:34.837
Hear you out?

00:05:35.238 --> 00:05:36.678
What is there left to explain?

00:05:38.762 --> 00:05:40.282
Do you want to explain

00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:42.237
what you put

00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:43.717
in my food?

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.192
Or explain

00:05:48.757 --> 00:05:51.397
how you killed my family

00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:56.397
while whispering that you loved me?

00:05:56.678 --> 00:05:58.316
I just loved you too much.

00:05:58.317 --> 00:05:59.118
Love?

00:06:02.358 --> 00:06:03.878
You don't deserve to say love.

00:06:07.358 --> 00:06:08.438
Your love

00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:12.678
is scars carved into my body.

00:06:13.358 --> 00:06:14.678
In the end,

00:06:16.517 --> 00:06:19.682
you erased all my memories.

00:06:27.317 --> 00:06:28.238
Che,

00:06:29.157 --> 00:06:30.295
tell me.

00:06:31.062 --> 00:06:33.062
If I dig out your heart,

00:06:33.397 --> 00:06:35.477
will it be black?

00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:41.558
Even if it's black,

00:06:43.118 --> 00:06:44.957
it's because of you.

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:06.597

Ru.

00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:51.160
What's wrong, Young Lady?

00:07:51.598 --> 00:07:52.917
You knew all along,

00:07:52.918 --> 00:07:54.477
and you helped him lie to me,

00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:55.156

Young Lady,

00:07:55.957 --> 00:07:57.517
I did it to protect you.

00:07:57.717 --> 00:07:58.637
Protect me?

00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:01.477
You've turned me

00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:04.037
into a puppet who forgot who she was.

00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:07.277
Is this what you call protection?

00:08:08.558 --> 00:08:10.438
I didn't want to see you like this.

00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:12.077
You didn't want me to take revenge?

00:08:13.517 --> 00:08:14.717
Or were you afraid

00:08:15.478 --> 00:08:17.678
I'd expose your lie?

00:08:19.118 --> 00:08:20.037
Di,

00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:22.397
I thought

00:08:23.358 --> 00:08:24.636
you were the last person

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.238
I could trust.

00:08:33.998 --> 00:08:34.918
Leave.

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:36.076
Young Lady.

00:08:36.077 --> 00:08:37.037
Leave!

00:09:30.478 --> 00:09:32.837
The woman Yuewen Que loves the most.

00:09:34.598 --> 00:09:36.438
You'll soon know

00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:38.477
a boat courtesan's daughter

00:09:38.718 --> 00:09:39.798
will only

00:09:40.677 --> 00:09:42.837
ever drift on the water.

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:51.438
This fabric is
vermilion silk cloud brocade.

00:09:52.238 --> 00:09:54.638
Even the stitches are embroidered
with gold thread.

00:09:54.718 --> 00:09:56.757
This is what I should be wearing.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.318
Once I marry Yuwen Que,

00:10:00.838 --> 00:10:03.518
no one in this palace
will look down on me again.

00:10:08.478 --> 00:10:11.877
A boat courtesan's daughter
dares to wear a phoenix robe?

00:10:13.557 --> 00:10:15.158
At tomorrow's court assembly,

00:10:15.277 --> 00:10:16.877
you'll wear that outfit

00:10:16.878 --> 00:10:18.717
and dance in front of all the officials.

00:10:19.598 --> 00:10:21.077
Let everyone see

00:10:21.437 --> 00:10:23.477
what kind of woman

00:10:23.517 --> 00:10:25.798
the prince likes.

00:10:30.878 --> 00:10:32.636
The crown princess

00:10:32.637 --> 00:10:34.997
was never you.

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:38.638
You're finally here.

00:10:39.517 --> 00:10:41.318
Your Ladyship, this medicine...

00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:42.518
I know.

00:10:43.998 --> 00:10:47.318
When the Soul-Drawing Fragrance
combines with this Gu poison,

00:10:47.478 --> 00:10:49.597
fifteen minutes is all it takes

00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:51.278
to make someone obedient.

00:10:51.478 --> 00:10:52.077
Yes.

00:11:03.437 --> 00:11:04.717
Perfect timing to wake up.

00:11:06.157 --> 00:11:07.237
You think

00:11:07.598 --> 00:11:08.997
you can control me?

00:11:10.157 --> 00:11:12.198
You think too highly of yourself.

00:11:12.517 --> 00:11:14.997
This is Soul-Drawing Fragrance
from Nanjiang.

00:11:15.277 --> 00:11:19.032
It can even lure out one's soul.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:23.558
Don't worry.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.558
Soon,

00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:28.237
you won't need to worry
about anything at all.

00:11:35.277 --> 00:11:36.158
Look.

00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:37.678
Isn't this better?

00:11:38.157 --> 00:11:39.477
Be obedient.

00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:41.678
It's good for everyone.

00:11:44.318 --> 00:11:45.837
Tomorrow at the court assembly,

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:47.678
I want her to dance

00:11:47.797 --> 00:11:50.477
harder than the dancers
in the pleasure houses.
