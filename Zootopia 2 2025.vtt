Blood, blood, blood, blood, and death.
All right, you know what you're milking

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.460
it. I think we got it. I think we got
it. We got it up there. Thank you,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.400
Yak. You laid it all out beautifully.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.100
I frame Lionheart. I can frame you, too.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.440
It's my word against yours.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.160
Actually, it owes our every predator in
Zootopia to keep it that way. It's your

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
word against yours.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.480
It's called a hassle, sweetheart.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.290
Unlikely duo Judy Hoff, the city's first
bunny cop, and Nicholas Wilde, a small

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.630
-time street fox, uncovered a conspiracy
by Mayor Bellwether today using a toy

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.930
carrot recorder pen.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.870
Wilde later joins the ZPD himself, where
the pair are now the very first bunny

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.430
fox team in the history of Zootopia.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.520
The former actor Brian Windancer hailed
the two during celebrations for the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.560
100th anniversary of the invention of
Zootopia's weather walls that allowed

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.340
environments and all animals to coexist
in one city.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.000
This is our Zootopia.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.080
And if a lonely country bunny and a
shifty, likely criminal fox could ignore

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.640
their vast, vast differences and solve
bias and stereotype forever, then maybe

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.430
I would get off. embrace our
differences, and be better together.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.450
We're going to crack a new case, make
the world a better place, and be the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.670
greatest partners of all time.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.010
I mean, we're not that different.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.650
At the ZPD.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.860
Partnership. is the cornerstone of
success.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.040
You want to put bad guys away?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.140
Be on the same page every day.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.880
Now, today's bad guy is this customs
inspector who's been smuggling illegal

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.400
overseas cargo to the city's shipyard.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.760
Captains Hockbottom and Truffler will
lead.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.900
Higgins floats, flank left.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.880
Chevro, push run, right. And down the
middle, the zebras. Zebras.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.480
Hock's work. I know you're eager. to
prove yourselves, but as rookies, you

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.660
observe only and watch the veteran
teams.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.320
Show you how it... Chief, hi. If you're
looking for Nick and Judy, they said

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.500
they got it, and they're already on site
with their baby.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.400
Are you sure this will work? You're the
one that said we needed a bust. Just

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400
follow my lead, okay?

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.290
Proud parents first.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.690
Mr. Inspector.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.930
Inspector Snootley.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.470
Inspector? What do you do?

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.530
Ensure that nothing illegal gets
smuggled here in one of these cargo

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.650
That's a weird way to ask that.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.930
Anyway, you gotta leave. You can't be
here.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.230
Wait.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.310
Wait.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.990
He's right, gosh darn it.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.850
You are right, sir.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.630
I guess we should have thought this
through. Right, babe?

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.590
Before we decided to come down here to
this.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.520
industrial shipyard to celebrate the big
day of our birthday boy.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.800
It's his birthday?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.440
Yeah, first one since the accident.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.740
And you know the one thing that the
little thinker wished for, aside from

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.680
day getting his tail reattached, was to
see a choo -choo. And to maybe get a

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.360
toot -toot conductor to sign his cast
button.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.220
I'm betting a customs inspector would be
even better.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680
Really?

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.400
All right. For the kid. For the kid. Oh,
you were saying.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.060
Thank you so much. Here you go. Either
leg.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.359
Or both.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.360
I don't care.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.340
Maybe put a doodle on it. Doesn't need
to be perfect. He's also legally blind.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
I put a little train there because I
know you like trains.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.410
Am I always going to be in the passenger
seat? Because if we're establishing

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.910
science... Back off, rookies!

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.410
Let me keep talking!

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.150
Ma 'am, we are a real theme.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.750
Shortcut, take the tunnel.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160
And these are links.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.930
This is our most reliable source.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.870
Funny! Orange dog in here now.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.350
Sir, today may not have been ideal, but
the anteater was captured. By the

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.770
zebras! Zebras!

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.130
Shut it!

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:41.190
Zebras. It was us. But more importantly,
I believe we may have made a

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.250
significant discovery.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.150
The stolen van contained a smuggled
crate from overseas, pamphlets for the

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.870
Zutennials, and some type of reptile
skin. I've already sent tables for

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.070
What?

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.790
You two tore up half the city. Because
of you, we had to call in Jumbo Unit to

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.570
remove a dick -dick from a tuba. You're
almost out.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.270
Who's catching him?

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.450
Sorry. Could you show me that clip
again? I wasn't wearing my glasses.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.150
Did you or did you not disobey a direct
order to stand down?

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.230
Sir, we were in pursuit. And Article 6,
Paragraph B states if the lead

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.470
officer... Yeah, I'm not lead officer.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.510
You're one hit wonder if you should go
back to meet her meeting and sling it.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.480
If I may, I think someone's just jealous
that we got to drive the squeal mobile.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.460
Or maybe you thought it was your mama.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.360
You know, this sounds a lot like just a
you guys conversation, so what I'm going

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.920
to do is I'm going to go ahead and... Is
there a reason why you don't take

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.980
anything seriously?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.120
Jokes are a classic defense mechanism
for someone with a traumatic childhood.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.700
Would you like a traumatic adulthood?

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.520
I would not. I allowed you to work
together because you did this city a

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:36.900
service. But today, you messed it all
up. And now, some... questioning whether

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.360
you should have been partners in the
first place. So instead of chasing

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.160
imaginary reptiles, I am pulling you
from the field and giving you a new

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.640
assignment reserved for special teams
like yourselves.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.940
Fail at this and I will have no choice
but to split you up.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.200
There will be no more hops and wild.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.680
But if you're as good as you think you
are,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.720
this is your moment to shine.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:13.050
Welcome to Partners in Crisis, a
workshop for duos heading for disaster.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:19.010
I'm your therapy animal, Dr. Fuzzby, and
you are here because mismatched

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.050
pairings often need a little more work
to make them work.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.870
Greg, we talked about that.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.130
What are we making, Merlin?

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.550
Uncomfortable. Yes.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.690
And Francine, Clark may be a mouse, but
he is your partner first.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.230
And we have two new partners.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.730
Can you tell us about your journey to
dysfunction junction?

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.550
Well, we've been official partners for
one week. The anniversary.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.650
And we are not dysfunctional at all,
actually. Functioning fine. Better than

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.550
fine. And we did sort of save the city.
So us being here kind of seems like a

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.550
huge misunderstanding.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.540
Notice how she answered first, did not
allow her partner to speak, seems to be

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.680
in a state of denial, taps her foot when
she's suppressing discomfort, and

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.760
observed the source of her discomfort,
represented by the disconnected

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.120
affectation of her emotionally insecure
partner.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.420
But with hard work, they'll be on the
same page by year two.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.280
But for now, let's begin by greeting our
teammate.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.540
Who'd like to go first?

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880
Thank you, Joel.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.960
Okay, unfortunately, Karen... has chosen
to see Joel's smile as a sign of

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.980
aggression. Heckles down, Karen.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.759
Heckles down.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.420
Joel, the safe word is coconut.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.820
Okay, we have to set another meeting
with the chief.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.360
Promise we'll do better.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.340
Oh, zebras.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.820
You talk back less. Maybe not at all.
Yeah, or we go with my playbook and we

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.940
just lay low.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.600
We are stuck in that room. And if we
complain to Chief B, if you'll just make

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.640
stay longer, play it smart, stay off the
radar, and don't let it get to you,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.300
okay? Because we are the dream team.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.740
Whoops!

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240
Sorry, Paul.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.200
Oh, roll out the red carpet. Here's the
stupid cops.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.480
Where's the boxing?

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.920
You suck!

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.220
Easy, partner.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.620
Let me ask you something.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.020
Do you think we're a good team?

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.420
Of course.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.880
I just wish I knew what we had to do to
prove it to everyone else.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.120
Or maybe we don't have to prove anything
to anybody.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.460
We do.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760
Forever.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.440
And the sooner everyone sees a fox and a
bunny can be great partners, the

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.300
better. Enjoy it. I got to. I'd rather
chew off my own arm.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.820
on TV.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840
You okay?

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.420
Everything's fine, Mom.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.980
Uh -oh. Yeah, everyone knows fine is a
cry for help.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.780
You know who else cried for help? That
dick dick stuck in that tuba. Oh, him

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:43.880
the dick dick. What does your fox
partner say? Well, Nick's not really a

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.880
Well, you two are very different.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.480
Small town hero raised on a farm. Big
city crook raised on the streets.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.680
I pray every day that you'll come back
home and make baby, Mom. Just remember

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.880
the first rule of partnerships.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.090
You can be right, or you can be happy.
That's true. There's nothing wrong with

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.530
dying a little inside so you can meet in
the middle. Honey, you're pushing me

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.990
out. Well, I want to make sure I can be
seen. Well, if she can see both of us.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.250
Okay, gotta go. Work you do. Bye, Bun
Bun. Everything's gonna be fine. You two

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.370
just need a new case. Hey, we'll be
trying to find that dick pit. Bye.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.560
future of their neighborhood.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:46.720
But tonight, we put our differences
aside and celebrate at the Zootennial

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.020
where the Lakesley Journal will be on
display for the first time in a century,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.660
following an infamous reptile attack.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.800
The Lakesley Journal, containing the
patented Weatherwall plan, was

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.700
written by Ebenezer Lakesley, bringing
the whole...

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.120
The 100th anniversary of the weather
walls is also the 100th anniversary of

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.320
Zootopia's only snake attack.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:57.280
The victim? A tortoise. The Linkley
family maid, who has fanged while

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.000
stopping a venomous snake from stealing
the Linkley journal.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:07.680
No one has seen a snake in Zootopia
since, but I'm convinced one will

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.420
My only question is, is he going to be
wearing half a pants?

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.440
Or one long sock.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.800
You say justice is dead?

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.020
I say no.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.560
Well,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.880
well. You missed me already, huh? The
stolen band with the snake skin is from

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.740
the same catering company that's working
the gala.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.300
This is you studying your partner book.
Listen to me.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.540
Venomous snake...

00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:59.600
The Foxes are solitary.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.280
And look, we go and you're wrong, Chief
Beef will split us up. And if we don't

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.220
get a win soon and prove we're great
partners, the Chief will split us up

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.780
anyway. Check the perimeter.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.700
snoop a little, we find nothing, we
bail.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.340
But if I'm right, no one will question
whether you and I belong together again.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360
We need this.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.940
Fine. But we'll still have to get
through security, and in Fancy Town, a

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.860
a bunny won't exactly blend in.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.980
That's why we'll be undercover!

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.980
See, you're still in the driver's seat.
Come on, get on up!

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.240
We're wild and we can't be taped.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.860
And we're turning a bar into a zoo.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.540
Here we go, here we go, let's go.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.620
You talk, I don't hear you.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.820
We're living a pretty world, caught up
in a rat race.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.380
Country, jungle life, sometimes a mad
place.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:03.110
When will you begin the Tundra Town
expansion? Come on, Dad. Have a

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.110
time at the...

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.780
Same page means your page.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.140
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.720
You change that chair. I get the van.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.660
Huh.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.200
Huh.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.400
It's the Zootennial Gala. A bunny comes
prepared.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.020
You know, I used to dream of...

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.500
Infiltrating a place like that.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.520
You know, this is not your worst idea.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.860
Wow, that was almost a compliment.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.400
Your worst idea is what you did with
your ears.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.880
Why would a snake want to steal
someone's book anyway?

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.220
I don't know.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.540
But no one is going to steal it because
we are here to protect it.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.140
The journal is in the reserved section.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120
Okay.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.059
Come on.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.060
Slow down.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.200
You want to fit in?

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.620
Commando is not going to cut it.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.700
It's not just the clothes, okay?

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.280
It is the vibe.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.230
Good to see you. Hey, real nice humps.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.770
Oh, is that real me? There's real Fox.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.610
Get invited to a lot of these?

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.390
Invited? No, but there's other reasons
to hobnob.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.830
Madam, excuse me, is this yours?

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.070
Why, yes.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.810
Well, allow me.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.370
Clever Fox.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.620
I apologize.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.220
Oh, gosh, he hates me. Here.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.080
Oh, you're my hero.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.500
Well, just like to be prepared for any
possible scenario.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.360
Which is not a weird thing to say to
party.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.340
Well, I just mopped a spill with that
guy's tail, so... Ah!

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.820
Uh, Poverty. I am Poverty. Hi.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.740
Judy. I'm Judy Hopps. Ah! What the pork?

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.280
Well, to the nice, to me, Judy. Wait,
Judy Hopps? The Judy Hopps?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.940
Are you working this? I mean, you're
clearly working it.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.300
But are you actually working this?

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.960
Uh, no.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.960
I'm actually, well, it's just a hunch.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520
Protecting that.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.800
Good. I don't think it has enough
guards.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.840
Thought that was my joke.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.820
And there's nothing here.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.160
Let's call it a night.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.600
Hops?

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.040
Look, we should...

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.540
It's nice to meet you.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.760
Yes, and you?

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.140
Bon appetit.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.960
If at any point tonight you choose to
eat, bon appetit then.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.720
You're supposed to be offstage, Popper.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.320
Yeah, get offstage, Popper.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.900
Are you? Yeah, I am a Blink -3.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.920
Or, you know, I'm trying to be. Now,
Popper.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.480
Come on, Poppy. I got you, Pop. No, I
haven't. I haven't. All right, let's get

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.520
this thing started.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.800
I think I might actually... I think I've
got something.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.940
Ah, look at you.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.200
Good to see you.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.300
It is with great pleasure that I
introduce the third generation...

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:35.840
you hear me? I have a trail. ...of our
great city, Milton Linkley.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.840
Thank you, thank you.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:43.860
What are you doing here? She was right.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.900
You're done. You're both done. My
grandpa had a dream to build the city

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.900
of us.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.920
Truly, it's better to...

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.380
And when I do, my family will finally be
able to come home.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.760
I am here.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.060
Pops and Miles.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.179
Dream team.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.020
We got him. Or her.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.780
Reptiles. It's like, who knows?

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.200
The cops are right behind us.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.960
Kill the snake.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.640
We'll burn the journal. If he wants it,
it's dangerous.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.320
And you two will file a report.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.220
will keep your mouth shut.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.240
by embattled BPD officers Nicholas Wilde
and Judy Hunt.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.980
All three now suspects in the tragic
fanging of Zootopia's chief of police

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.520
considered extremely dangerous.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.020
Chief Bogo is dead.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.000
Those are words I'm glad I don't have to
say.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.660
I might have to, sir. The doctor's a
little worried about that.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:16.400
What has happened tonight was more than
horseplay.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.540
they've already destroyed.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.920
One, two.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.200
I got up to two.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.060
Would you like to be three?

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.720
I want them gone.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.040
But aren't there walls?

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.800
I will say this once, Brian.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.560
You will retrieve the journal.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.440
Or maybe I chose the wrong mayor.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.560
Did I choose the wrong mayor?

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:10.640
is the first thing on track sorry i have
never been on the run from the law

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.500
before yeah boy it's almost like we
should have gone to that gala okay

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:23.260
we already did it your way with mr big
we do it mine this is where having a

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:28.900
partner from the underworld is really
gonna pay off raymond and is that cat

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.420
by the lynxes and an innocent chicken.
Really, the lynxes are killers.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.400
And they have no honor.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.940
And that Thunder Town expansion only
makes them more dangerous.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.480
Territorial animals will do anything for
long enough.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.620
But whenever you're tangled up and it
threatens their plans, you're dead.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.560
You don't fight the cats.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.980
You leave.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:23.920
Sir, I know you're trying to look out
for us.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:29.770
But we took an oath to protect this
city. And justice doesn't run. On behalf

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:36.350
myself, Rick Wild, and Miss Trudy, we
thank you for your trust to salvation.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:39.449
I cannot accept your offer. We are
helping that snake.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.690
Boy, you're really tossing that we
around.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.730
Snakes may have been framed for the
fanging of that tortoise. Do you have

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:46.629
idea why?

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.850
Or how this book could prove it?

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:50.090
I wish I did.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.670
But it has to do with snakes.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.380
Your best bet is talking to a reptile.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.640
Do you know any?

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.640
Almost no one does.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.240
They keep to themselves.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.800
Hide out in marsh markets.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:44.480
to talk to a jackalope which are real
mom excuse us team meeting vetoing the

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.600
b new vote all in favor of truck to
being alive and laying low till this

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.700
over bill i mean pups and wild do not
bail on a case which is crazy probably

00:35:53.700 --> 00:36:00.180
lead poisoning for getting too many
pencils do you know a reptile who can

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.640
us the hidden secret in here why the mix
is

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:15.190
and trudy cabbage patch it is uh it's
trudy cabbage patch and the safe word is

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:19.910
coconut in the darkness of a dank
underpath they stepped into the vehicle

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:25.090
realizing their lives were about to
change because we're gonna meet our

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.150
because you're about to be

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.580
white snake wants a paycheck.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.120
It's my old lizard friend, Hey, Sue.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.240
Why would a lizard hide here?

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.520
Well, when Zootopia was founded, the
whole neighborhood got cut off from the

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.419
rest of the town.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.660
Kind of on their own here.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.300
Yeah, it's probably why reptiles like
it. They can just do their thing.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.240
Plus, it's the only place in town you
can get away with wearing a shirt and no

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.860
pants. Love and tour time with
Woodchuckles.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.570
Like a hole in the head.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.070
Bad timing.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:30.570
Okay,

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.830
to get to Jesus' hideout, you've got to
take a ferry.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.970
Just let me handle the locals. Water
folk tend to be a little standoffish

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.930
Landy. Well, I've been hustling the
streets since I was 12. I think I can

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:42.950
a juggling deal.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.430
The lion.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.290
He's not from around here. But coins are
coins.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:50.690
Nope, nope, change.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.190
It's a choking hazard.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:54.570
Well?

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.300
Just take open and respectful
communication.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.340
Hey bub. Hey bub. Hey bub. Hey bub. Hey
bub.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.760
Hey bub. Hey bub. Hey bub.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.640
Hey bub. Hey bub. Hey bub. Hey bub. Hey
bub. Hey bub. Hey bub.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.860
Hey bub.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.180
Hey bub.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:48.930
So much better than sitting on a beach
on Outback Island sipping piña koalas.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:54.490
We are not skipping town when there is
an innocent snake out there who needs

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.910
He's got help.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.670
His motorcycle buddy.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:01.390
You are acting weird. What is your
problem?

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:08.530
Well, A, you railroaded me. And B, if
you must know, I have an

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.510
aversion to reptiles.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.190
What?

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.380
Is my discomfort hilarious to you? No,
I'm sorry. You're right. We are

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.820
And whenever I'm uncomfortable, you are
always very considerate of my feelings.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080
Look out! Take this!

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.680
Ow! Hold the rail. Hold the rail. Hold
the rail. Hold the rail.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.580
Hold the rail. Hold the rail. Hold the
rail. Hold the rail. Hold the rail.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:39.900
I think the real mystery is how you two
ever solved anything.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.600
Let's see what hate foods have to say
about your journal. Oh, and if he offers

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.600
you food, accept.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.580
Declining is a sign of disrespect.

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.230
mystery and try not to get murdered.

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.450
Maybe that's it.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.150
Oh, okay.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:02.790
Oh,

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:08.190
I'm good, but these guys look hungry.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:17.010
Thank you for meeting with us. We
believe snakes were framed for something

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.890
this journal. Perhaps pertaining to...

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.988
What does that mean?

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:22.230
It means it's fancy.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:28.790
It also means the secret you're looking
for is probably right on the cover.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:34.350
Somehow, vipers can see things in the
metal, even under the paint.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.830
This is Ebenezer Linksley's original
journal for the weather walls.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:42.610
Why would he hide a secret for a snake?

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:44.170
I don't know.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.040
I am guessing that it was a slow death.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.400
The fanging didn't just change how folks
saw snakes.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.460
No mammal trusted any reptile after
that.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.880
That's why we all left.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.180
And that's when the Lynxleys expanded
Tundra Town.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.580
Mars market will be buried in snow.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.640
We'll all get pushed out.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.000
Those lynxes will get more land.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.480
And there's no way to stop them.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.620
What if the secret hidden in here could?

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.680
Then I would say, holding it.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.300
the city once, I reckon you can save it
again.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:26.900
And when you do, maybe everyone will see
we ain't that different.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.480
A -bomb! A -bomb! A -bomb!

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:34.880
A -bomb!

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:41.790
Sorry's may be in order.

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:44.090
Nick, it's okay.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.050
I know you didn't want to lose him on
purpose.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.030
Oh, not me sorry.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.410
No, no. You sorry.

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:59.730
Well, now we kind of have no way to find
him or stop the links, so agree to

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:00.730
disagree.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.250
But we are alive.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:09.090
So if we can't find him, that's great.
What we can find is a truck out of here.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.360
Trudy Cabbage Patch, leaving town. We're
done.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.180
Julie!

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.100
Now, this is a bad place for you to be.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.360
You're a big idiot.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.400
Julie fell out of the tube. Okay, give
the cop police your help. No, no, no,

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.560
we're fine. Yeah, but we were just
leaving town.

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:47.420
Actually, do you happen to know where
the tube goes?

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:53.660
Oh, Coppenhoofen. Yeah, Coppenhoofen.
Got it. You chew too much. This is not

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.660
okay.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.070
This is the only plastic roll.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:11.890
Is there anything else up there?

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.490
Nope, there sure isn't. Oh, yeah?

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:17.710
Old Honeymoon Lodge. What was closed for
a long time was a hideout for snakes.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:24.390
Honeymoon Lodge? How do you reach it?

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:25.650
Oh.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.480
Did he figure out where we are?

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.380
If anything, we should be going faster.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.960
As I always say... I really am just a
dumb bunny.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:11.460
Nick? I really am just a dumb, dumb,
dumb, dumb, dumb bunny. Just a dumb,

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.320
dumb, dumb, dumb bunny. This was a gift
to symbolize our partnership.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.140
And it is not appropriate for this
moment.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:23.460
Oh, no, I was just hoping to jot down
some ideas for what we will put on our

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:28.200
tombstones. I'll start. His partner did
it. What happened to you that you can't

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.200
just have a normal conversation?

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.200
I will save that for my therapy animal.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:41.820
Yeah, you need a therapy animal. Well,
you need a herd of therapy

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.320
animals. Yeah, you need a whole
migration of therapy animals.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.280
Carrots?

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:06.550
A carrot.

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.370
Carrots.

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:33.810
They're home.

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:38.470
The Lynxes just erased it.

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.770
This is what they do.

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:47.410
We have to go. They push animals out
with lives so they can have more. We

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:51.650
go, Garrus. We gotta go. That's what the
thing's trying to prove. CPD is here.

00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.990
What?

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:57.450
No one will believe us. Not without
proof. Leave it. They were gonna just

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.150
us. The Lynxes want us dead.

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:00.830
We need to solve the case.

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.730
Judy, you just have to solve the case.
Nick!

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:05.250
I don't care about the case.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:09.730
Judy, it's not worth dying for.

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:18.090
The world will never be a better place
if no one is brave enough to do the

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:23.790
thing. The world is what it is, Carrot.
And sometimes, being a hero,

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:27.770
it just doesn't make a difference.

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.920
Not my family.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.320
They caught him.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:21.040
But out here, no one's gonna catch us.

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.740
Mayor Windancer.

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:35.640
Where's the bunny?

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.400
I don't know.

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.660
But, you know, she's a rabbit.

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:41.880
So maybe you can pull her out of your
hat.

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.540
I'm not wearing a hat.

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.920
It's messing with you, sir.

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:47.760
I knew that. Get him out of here.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:56.580
Where are they, Mr. Wilde?

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.920
Begin the expansion.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.720
Freeze Marsh Market.

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.060
Flush everyone out.

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.660
Water folk.

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:09.520
Like foxes. Or lesser mammals.

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:15.910
If I say they helped a dangerous snake,
no one will care what we do.

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:23.910
You're going to a dark cell, Mr. Wilde.
Just long enough to read the headline of

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:25.130
your partner's demise.

00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.340
Find Puppet.

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.640
Almost to be hideout.

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.300
Snake in the hole.

00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:57.820
Yes, yes.

00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.260
We shall succeed, Judy Hopps.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.760
We'll stop them in place and save your
partner.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.540
I'm sorry. You are?

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.840
Oh, Gary.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.880
Gary the Snake.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.540
And your last name?

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.820
The Snake.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.800
Everything is going to be okay.

01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:43.750
Welcome to my oasis.

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:46.730
Away from my evil family.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:49.630
I like to come here and kind of zedge
out.

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:51.650
Get with all my cats.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.129
of the journal.

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:15.370
How did you become partners?

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:19.850
Oh, when I found out the journal was
going to be on display at the gala, I

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:25.150
his family an anonymous letter asking to
see it. Luckily, they make pulver work

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:27.630
in the mail room, so he read it first.

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.050
I got him smuggled in from overseas.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:32.170
Seven days in a crate.

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:35.970
But if I fix things for my family, it'll
be worth it.

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:39.350
Then we'll fix things for your partner,
too.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:52.260
I know coming with us was hard, but
we're going to help your partner the

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.740
way we're going to help the city.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.400
We stop my family and show everyone the
truth.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.160
Are you ready?

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.840
Light the fire.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:13.580
How much do you

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.580
know?

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:21.390
Well, that his family was framed, and
there's some secret hidden in the metal

01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:24.190
cover that only a snake can see.

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:26.210
Not just any snake.

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:29.510
A heat -sensing pit viper.

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:33.150
All it takes is a little warmth.

01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:37.170
I just... I don't understand.

01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:41.910
Why would your great -grandfather hide a
secret for a snake?

01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:44.690
He didn't.

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:51.170
wasn't his journal.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.690
That's the secret.

01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:58.930
Zootopia wasn't created by a mammal.

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:03.050
It was created by a snake.

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.090
Gary's great -grandmother.

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:12.370
She wanted to make the city a place
where all animals felt welcome.

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:18.670
So she invented her weather walls to
help.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320
Everyone.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.720
She just needed an investor.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.160
A partner.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.540
But when my great -grandfather saw what
her idea could be worth,

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:43.600
he plotted to steal her plans and

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600
himself.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:02.880
made and framed Gary's great
-grandmother.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:09.340
And because she was a snake, everyone
believed his lie.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:15.700
Soon, no reptiles were welcome.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:23.660
And over time, my great -grandfather
buried the reptile neighborhood

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.460
in snow.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:34.400
And he died believing no one could ever
uncover his crimes.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:41.320
But he was wrong.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.340
Her original patent was saved.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:52.220
That's what you're looking for. She hid
it in her home.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.360
Find her home.

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:08.670
Didn't know where her home was buried.

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:12.210
Until now.

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:15.230
My family's land?

01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:21.530
But under all that now, how are we going
to find it?

01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:23.710
Wait. Clock tower.

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:27.890
Her neighbor, the reptile neighborhood,
had a clock tower.

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:33.250
It lights up like a beacon. If it wasn't
fully buried, maybe we could see it.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:34.950
Follow it to her home.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.180
Except that my great -grandfather turned
off the power.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.800
But we have the plans that show us how
to turn it back on.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:48.500
The power switch to her whole
neighborhood was in the original control

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:49.538
All right.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.680
And where is it?

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.960
Inside the oldest wall of the city. The
desert, tender town weather wall.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.800
We get inside, turn on that switch,
light the clock tower.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.160
We find her house.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.880
We find her patent.

01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:07.050
And my family is finally coming home.

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:11.530
We will succeed, Judy Hopps. We shall
succeed!

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.310
I found him.

01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:19.430
Get me Hogbottom.

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:22.330
Oh,

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:25.570
it's Nibble and Wild.

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:29.990
Big time cops, huh? I'll feed you at the
lunch table.

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.850
I'm going to tie your tail with a knot.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.540
Hogbottom. What are you looking at,
butthead?

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.900
This is a mistake. It's his setup. It's
the Lynxes.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:45.120
Listen to me, please. I know we have had
our differences, right, but I've always

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.400
respected you.

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.580
You don't respect anyone.

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.360
Fern, it's Milton Lynxley.

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.420
He's got the rapper's location.

01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:00.340
Whatever he says, it's a lie, Hogbottom.
Hogbottom, listen.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.180
Like, Judith got away.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:32.480
Was that decision mutual?

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.060
Oh. Sensing trouble in paradise.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.080
Want to talk about it? What I want is to
get out of here.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.500
Right. Big plan.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:47.740
Lay low on Outback Island sipping pina
koalas. Except you can't trust koalas

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.040
because they got four thumbs.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.400
Did a whole episode about it on the
podcast.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.680
It was called, They Got Four Thumbs. But
you know what? At least they ain't

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:59.790
platypus. Like, can you just... Can you
please just let me concentrate?

01:08:00.290 --> 01:08:01.290
Roger that.

01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:07.950
Just talk to me, dude.

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:11.450
What's the last thing she said to you?

01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:18.430
She, um, she said maybe we are too

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:21.390
different. Hmm.

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:24.229
And what did you say before that?

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:27.270
I said the case isn't worth dying for.

01:08:28.339 --> 01:08:34.560
Like, you know, it isn't worth her dying
for because

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:41.160
solitary animals like me don't have real
friends.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.819
And I don't want to lose her.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.720
I just, I don't know how to say that.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.340
You know what, bud?

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.880
I think you just did.

01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:02.870
Wait, how'd you do that? Well, I open my
arms, put them around you, and then I

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:05.290
squeeze. It's called a hug.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:07.029
Do foxes not have hugs?

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:09.770
Oh, the lock.

01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:11.250
Yeah, that's Beeb 101.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:20.890
Your partner needs you, and Nibbles
Mabelstick is going to get you to her.

01:09:38.859 --> 01:09:39.859
my new home.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.300
Do not think we can get to Judy in time
to help.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:20.280
Unless you happen to know the fastest
driver in the history of Zootopia.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:39.220
Hey, Flash, Flash, Underguard, Dash.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.720
Partners in trouble need to get across
town. Ignore the laws.

01:10:55.850 --> 01:11:01.050
is our most reliable... Turn

01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:06.830
on the clock tower and light the way to
your great -grandma's home so we can

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:07.529
find her patent.

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:11.370
We need to reach the power control room
through here, but we have to move

01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:13.790
quickly or we're never going to... Look,

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:19.450
Gary, if we don't over -prepare, we're
under -prepared, and I don't... My

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:23.190
has been trying to prove we're not what
everyone thinks for a hundred years.

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:24.810
Even this close.

01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:28.610
They never want me to put the weight of
the world on my shoulders.

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:31.170
Because I don't have any shoulders.

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:34.650
We shall see.

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:40.510
I got you, rabbit.

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:47.290
I cannot help Judy if I don't know where
she is. Which is why I need you to get

01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:51.670
on Paul's computer and track Hotbottom.
You are an escaped fugitive. I could get

01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:53.970
fired for even talking to you. They're
going to put her...

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:56.010
Sleep. Do it. Okay.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.130
Did you try restarting it?

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:03.350
Have you tried not being an idiot? Hey,
Paul.

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:05.010
I got you some donuts.

01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:11.190
We meet again, zebra.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:15.390
Here come the hives!

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:21.030
She's going for the door! She's going
for the door!

01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:23.450
Clawhauser, we're out of time!

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:25.110
I got it!

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:28.930
Desert Tundratown, weather wall, access
door! Desert Tundratown, weather wall,

01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:30.010
access door, hurry!

01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:32.330
What is in that wall?

01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:36.590
A power controller. Like from some old
part of Tundratown.

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:38.490
I know what they're doing.

01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:39.950
Don't ruin us!

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:36.130
You're mad at me, but you get it.

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:38.750
We've always been on the same page.

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:42.290
Me and you, underdogs, right?

01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:46.730
You gotta prove you're as good as
everyone else, that you belong.

01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:52.870
I know it's messed up, but this is my
chance.

01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:58.150
I have to take it, because when I get to
his great -grandma's home,

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:07.150
something in my family that I'll finally
belong to.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.400
needs to find Nick.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.580
Yep. Should have seen that coming.

01:20:46.739 --> 01:20:48.220
She didn't make it.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.400
But with snake bites, you go fast.

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:54.860
You'll see.

01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:07.570
disagree.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:24.580
didn't say it i should have said it but
i didn't because

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:31.140
uh well because i am an emotionally
insecure

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:36.800
source of your discomfort who is not
good at expressing his feelings

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:42.580
probably because i've been on my own my
whole life it's not an excuse it's just

01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:47.980
it's why instead of telling you that
you're the best thing that ever happened

01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:48.980
me

01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:54.110
I make jokes about your ears and I tell
you that you try too hard when, you

01:23:54.110 --> 01:24:00.250
know, the truth is I just don't want you
to get hurt because no

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:04.650
one else in the world matters more to
me.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.920
I do try too hard because deep down I'm
afraid that I am what everyone thinks I

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:15.780
am. And I suppress my discomfort because
I'm worried it makes me look weak and I

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:18.720
want to be strong and I think of failing
all the time. And I only take what you

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.880
say personally because you're the only
one in my life who ever believed in me,

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.840
even when I don't even believe in
myself.

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.540
And I should have told you that.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.420
No one else in the world matters to me
more than you do either.

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.920
I have unresolved childhood trauma that
I refuse to discuss because being

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.940
vulnerable scares me. I make dangerous
choices because I have an unhealthy but

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:42.820
hero complex. And I didn't join the ZPD
because I wanted to be a cop. I joined

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.860
because I always wanted to be part of a
pack.

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:50.480
And the thought of losing you scares me
because... because you're my pack.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.100
I should never have left you. And I do
need a herd of therapy animals. And I

01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:59.580
should have told you that you are the
only partner I would ever want because

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.860
you're my fluffle.

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:05.640
That's a bunch of rabbits.

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:11.280
Now that is what we call an overshare.

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.720
I'm alive, by the way. I made it.

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:16.340
Oh, also, that guy's still alive.

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:25.060
She's going to get to the lost reptile
neighborhood, find Gary's great

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.400
-grandma's patents, and destroy it.
Yeah, I've got no idea what that means

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.760
who Gary is, but let's go.

01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:31.810
How's it wild?

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:34.590
Wild and hot. And limos and Gary.

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:36.070
He's Gary.

01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:37.430
Whoa.

01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:39.690
Thank you for the snake.

01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:41.470
He's cold. No fur on him.

01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:42.910
Bye now.

01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:51.910
You don't belong in this family. You
will never belong in this family.

01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:03.690
Where to find the real patent, the
truth, they invented the wall.

01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:06.190
I'm going to destroy it.

01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:07.610
For the family.

01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:10.530
For you, Daddy.

01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:16.490
You want to keep your job. You say
nothing.

01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:45.110
Must see it.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:20.880
I go left.

01:32:45.599 --> 01:32:46.599
That'll do.

01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:54.280
Astonishing news today. After officers
Judy Hawks and Nicholas Wilde, along

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:59.760
a pit piper and a beaver, foiled another
major conspiracy by revealing the true

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.960
inventor of the city's weather walls was
a snake.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:07.540
While the now disgraced Linsley family
were revealed to have stolen the

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:12.840
plans and covered it up for decades. You
have not heard the laugh of Melton!

01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:17.570
Their Tundra Town expansion now
officially canceled.

01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:20.850
They are calling you the dream team.

01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:22.470
How did you do it?

01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:27.810
Uh, well, there's a lot of different
animals out there.

01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:33.810
And sometimes we start to look at all
the little reasons that we're not the

01:33:33.810 --> 01:33:34.810
same.

01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:37.090
And it makes us worry.

01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:44.630
But maybe if we just talk to each other,
if we just... trying to understand one

01:33:44.630 --> 01:33:49.970
another, we would see that our
differences don't really make any

01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:55.870
all. Maybe we'd even see that what makes
me, me, and you, you,

01:33:56.090 --> 01:34:00.410
can make us even stronger.

01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:05.010
And with hard work, you're going to get
to that fight here too!

01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:08.110
See you, Rouse.

01:34:09.230 --> 01:34:10.550
Actually, my name is Gene.

01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:14.830
My name is also Gene.

01:34:15.570 --> 01:34:16.570
There you go.

01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:25.530
Kids,

01:34:28.450 --> 01:34:29.450
get off the snake.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.100
I'm still me, so I'm only saying it once
a decade.

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:22.120
Love you, partner.

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:25.040
Well, I'm going to need that back. I'll
give it back to you.

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:26.660
After our next case.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.460
There's going to be another case, huh?

01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:29.780
Of course.

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.700
Because when you broke out of jail, you
also released 200 highly dangerous

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:34.220
prisoners. Worth it.

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.620
Any idea where you want to start?

01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:38.300
Mm -hmm.

01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:43.960
Oh.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.980
One -way ticket to Outback. Island 3,
third class.

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.440
Very nice.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.320
Oh, and remember, if you're happy with
our service, please be sure to leave it

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:56.920
four thumbs up.

01:35:57.220 --> 01:35:58.560
Oh, I will.

01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:05.820
Hobbs and Wild.

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.460
Wild and Hobbitman.
