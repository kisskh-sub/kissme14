How's your day?

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.480
Not bad.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.840
Why are you having takeout again?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.840
It's your first day

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.440
at the company,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.360
shouldn't we celebrate?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.280
I bought a cake.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.680
I don't have time.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.720
I'm about to start streaming.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.520
Streaming? What streaming?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.880
Aren't you back working at the company?

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.000
Lin Chang says my alt account

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
is doing really well,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.280
with highly engaged followers.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.240
She wants me to keep it up.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240
Work during the day,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.000
and stream at night.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.800
So you've scheduled your

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.760
entire 24 hours?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.200
Don't worry about this. Just leave it here.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.800
I'm in my career's upward trajectory,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.720
just support me a bit.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.120
But are you leaving any time for me?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.640
I did!

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.960
I asked you to lunch,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.840
but you said you were busy.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.520
I was busy?

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.400
It's funny how we're living under the same roof

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.880
but experiencing jet lag.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.760
[Just put the cake in the fridge.]

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.800
[I'll eat it after I finish streaming.]

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.840
Fine.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.000
Have you finished eating?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.560
[Just leave it there. Don't worry about it.]

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.520
[Stop talking,]

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.600
I'll clean up for you.

[Stop talking, Fu Yudong.]

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.000
How's the talk with Cheng Man going?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.640
It's settled.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.800
She said

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.760
she'll support me.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.440
Cheng Man

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.680
is truly a remarkable wife.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.840
She supports whatever you want to do.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.000
That's all because of

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.200
my personal charm.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.840
Are you done warming up?

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.240
Yeah, just one last stretch.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.760
Ready?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.360
Come on!

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.600
Where do we start?

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.600
This line here.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.680
Here.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.440
This line, right?

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.880
Alright.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.560
Okay.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.320
Three,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.880
two,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.320
one,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.720
go!

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.480
Same rules as always,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.240
first one to reach the five-meter mark

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.840
loses,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.840
and the loser buys skewers.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.760
No stopping!

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.200
And you're even putting your hands in your pockets?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400
Who do you think you are,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.200
acting like a grandmaster?

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.159
Go!

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.760
You lose.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.520
Looks like you're buying skewers.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.000
You're really something else.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.159
Which restaurant?

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.720
Your choice.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.080
Have a drink, Yudong.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.680
How will you explain it

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.520
after drinking?

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.400
I'll just say you made me drink.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.240
Good,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.240
then we're all settled.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.560
I'll print out

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.480
the revised contract.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.680
Let's sign it today.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.320
No problem,

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.200
today is

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.560
perfect for signing contracts.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.680
Wait a moment,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.360
I've been thinking,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.080
we can add one more clause.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.040
Mr. Fu,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.960
during Double 11,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.960
you could come with your wife

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.080
to the livestream.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.760
This would add

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.200
credibility to your brand story.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.000
What do you think?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.400
Sure,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.720
she's also an influencer.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.200
Her name is Zhang Ran.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.480
I'll discuss it with her.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.120
Yes, his wife has a huge following.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.440
She's one of those really famous

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.280
influencers.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.080
What do we call this?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.480
This would be a perfect power collaboration!

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.920
That might not be appropriate.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.080
You see,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.520
we've done some background checks,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.840
your wife's company

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.680
actually competes with ours.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.040
There's a conflict of interest,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.600
so cooperation wouldn't be possible.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.040
Besides,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.440
we're not even in the same market segment.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440
I remember now,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.720
she is quite popular.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.000
She once said,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.080
ordinary people should be shameless,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.280
but that's quite different from

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.040
the persona we want

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.880
to create for Mrs. Fu.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.360
It probably wouldn't suit

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.720
your brand image.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.520
That's fine if we don't do it together.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.360
After all,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.840
it was just a random thought.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.160
Then,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.720
he can just go on by himself.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.000
Actually, she's not...

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.600
Yes, yes,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.880
she's actually a really nice person.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.160
But we still need someone.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.200
Otherwise,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.360
what makes you different

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.120
from other brands?

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.640
What's the point?

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.440
No, Lady Wan,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.880
regarding this collaboration,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.200
we're very sincere.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.240
You can't dismiss everything

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.360
we've already agreed upon

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:40.840
just because we couldn't agree

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.200
on this one thing.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.159
We've

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.440
already started preparing inventory.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.800
Mr. Fu, don't worry.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.160
I haven't said no.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.680
There's always a solution.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.920
Let's think about it,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.000
find a win-win solution.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.680
This isn't just for

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.520
our livestream,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.160
but also for

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.480
your brand's longevity

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.240
to consider.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.400
Specifically,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.600
how would this win-win situation

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.720
work?

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.720
In livestreaming,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.400
what's real or fake,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.200
who cares?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.520
What matters is

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.960
selling your products

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200
and building your brand.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.840
It's quite simple.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.080
I understand.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.960
I get it.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.920
What do you understand?

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.880
I get it.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.520
Don't worry,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.320
I'll arrange this.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.320
Mr. Li is so smart!

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.720
Well then, wish us good luck!

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.440
We have the luck.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.320
Yes, we have it.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.600
Cheers to cooperation.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.200
We have

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.320
another brand meeting later.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.000
Alright, go ahead with your work.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.560
I won't see you out then.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.040
We are okey.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.400
What do you understand now?

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.240
Isn't it clear?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.080
They want to find someone else

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.720
to pretend to be Mrs. Fu,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.320
to livestream with you.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.920
This is insane!

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.440
I have my own wife,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.280
why do I need someone else

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.120
to pretend to be my wife?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.480
They said Zhang Ran won't work,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.520
well then I won't work either.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.640
I'll tell them I quit!

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.000
You should go quickly.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.040
Six million.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.800
I have my everything on it.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.040
You go ahead.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.720
I've spent six million already

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.040
and sold everything I had.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.480
That amount is just right,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.400
enough to pay their penalty fee.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.920
I'll divorce my wife thereafter.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.080
She never

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.960
approved of this anyway.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.280
I really don't care.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.960
I just feel sorry for my boy.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.120
At such a young age,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.360
having to pay off my debt.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.840
Well, that's fine too. No need to stay at home,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.240
go out

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.480
and sell things for living.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.040
Li Daoqi,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.280
if we weren't at someone else's company,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.760
I would slap you!

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:55.920
Don't touch me!

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.880
What's the big deal?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.440
What's the big deal?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.760
You, you...

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.320
Look at it from a different perspective.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.000
Zhang Ran does this for a living.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.040
Just tell her the truth,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.360
say it's for work.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.760
And they said

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.280
it's all part of the show.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.800
Zhang Ran must understand that.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.480
She previously said

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.920
freeloading thing about you to her audience.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.640
Wasn't that also for the show's needs,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.120
to gain followers?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.960
Didn't she have to act too?

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.960
Zhang Ran will definitely understand!

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.200
Besides, Yudong,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.920
we've come so far

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.480
with such difficulty, right?

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.440
You need to see the bigger picture.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.360
What are you sighing about?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.360
Why did you come here?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.800
To feel the environment.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.560
No changes.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.560
No changes?

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.880
Over there.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.600
The lemur.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.080
How is it?

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.840
The lemur? It's good.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.080
The duty guard told me

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.400
that the lemur enclosure's

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.440
keeper

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.560
is quitting

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.640
and going back home.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.760
But

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.640
the zoo hasn't found

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.120
a suitable replacement,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.840
and they asked him to stay for a few more weeks.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.080
Bro, still don't get it?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.320
Your comprehension is really something else.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.800
Isn't working here better?

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.240
Better than being a cleaner?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.480
At least you won't have to work late nights.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.200
And look at the lemurs,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.280
how simple is that?

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.440
They can't escape

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.400
like what happened

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.240
before.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.440
It won't be my responsibility.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.160
I don't have experience or qualifications.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.400
If I say you have qualifications,

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.360
then you do.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.080
Experience is simple too.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.480
I'll pass on the experience

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.360
to you now.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.040
Still using this approach?

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120
All essential skills.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.520
Just look at it when you have time.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.200
This is him, say hello.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:37.920
Hey, Lee.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.720
Ge Kaiyang.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.160
[Smile.]

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:41.800
Hello.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.440
[Greet him properly!]

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.680
Why so reluctant?

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.320
Looks worse than crying.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.200
I just naturally look reluctant.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.640
Actually, I haven't told you,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.040
I'm fine working there.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.520
This area has many people,

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.520
many keepers,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.280
and I don't feel very comfortable.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.520
Fine,

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.600
why should you be comfortable?

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.720
Was cleaning toilets comfortable?

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.600
So unnecessary, Ge Kaiyang,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.880
you're always like this,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.600
trying to avoid everything.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.080
If you're so afraid of people, don't be human then.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.960
[You have serious issues, really.]

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.840
Ge Kaiyang, let me tell you,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.920
for you to work here,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.280
qualifications and experience

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.520
aren't the most important things.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.600
You know my relationship

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.600
with my father,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.280
we're practically strangers.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.600
For your sake,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.840
I even used

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.560
his connections.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.520
Oh my...

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.920
Why did you contact your father?

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.160
Because I couldn't

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.000
contact your father.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:44.840
Ge Kaiyang...

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.960
Why is she wearing a wedding dress?

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:00.880
Is it already decided?

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.720
Don't joke around, I'm not happy.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.360
Look at these two.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.840
Neither of them came today,

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.880
but I think,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.800
judging from their temperament and educational background,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.080
they seem quite suitable.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.040
No, no,

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.240
the photos are heavily edited.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.880
She had work done.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.800
It affects

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.000
the company's image.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.880
Really?

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.000
Come here.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.520
Here you are!

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.160
You've been looking for me?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.240
What's this about?

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.840
After Lady Wan's

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.040
suggestion last time,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.120
I immediately

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.760
reported this to Mr. Xing.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.840
He acted quickly

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.080
and helped you

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.440
arrange everything.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:42.960
I

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.200
knew your cooperation level

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.360
wouldn't be very high,

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.200
so we didn't call you for the first two rounds.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.640
Today is the third round

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.880
and final round.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.640
Of course, for the final candidate,

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.440
Lady Wan's side will make the decision.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.800
At least take a look yourself.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.400
Look at what?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.360
What do you mean?

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.160
Your future Mrs. Fu candidates!

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.960
Take a look,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.000
we've nearly gone cross-eyed reviewing them.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.160
Stop it!

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.200
What are you doing?

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:09.920
Sit down!

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.760
Where are you going?

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.680
This is a matter of principle!

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.000
What principle?

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.560
This is work.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:15.840
Sit down.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.000
Do you know how much effort

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.240
we've put into this?

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.680
Hello everyone, I'm Mary,

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.640
I'm 164 cm tall,

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.720
50 kg.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.040
I'm currently a yoga instructor,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.160
and my hobbies are

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.560
music and fitness.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.320
I have level 8 English

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.360
and level 6 piano.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.160
If I could

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.360
become Mrs. Fu,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.120
I believe I'll be

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.680
a great help to him.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.160
Hi, I'm Hanna,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.800
168 cm tall,

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.960
45 kg.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.120
I'm a minor actress.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:54.800
I don't think

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.840
I have any outstanding skills,

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.760
but I'm excellent at adapting my communication style

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.440
to different situations,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.320
especially

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.080
in special circumstances

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.079
and emergencies.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.119
Excuse me,

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:06.880
one question.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.920
Suppose

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.880
one night you come home from work,

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:10.880
it's very late,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.400
and you suddenly find

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.079
a ghost sitting in your living room.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.280
How would you use their language

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.160
to promote

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160
our product to it?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.200
Hello, I'm Wei Qiuqiu,

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.280
178 cm tall,

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.599
57 kg...

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.119
Hello, I'm Yuxiu,

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.000
gentle and refined...

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.960
Hi, I'm Billy...

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240
Hello,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.640
I believe you've already seen

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.800
my profile.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.680
Mr. Fu and I

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.320
share similar

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.360
overseas living experiences.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.680
I want to say

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.520
my experience and capabilities

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.080
make me more qualified than the other candidates here

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.840
for this position.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.240
You can call me Qi.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.320
Alright, Ms. Qi,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.600
if you had to use one sentence

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.560
to recommend to those

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.800
who haven't used

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.760
our product,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.080
what would you say?

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.160
Try it and you'll know.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.960
I think product matters

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.040
should be Mr. Fu's company's

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.840
concern.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.200
As his wife,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.440
I shouldn't interfere with his work

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.560
or participate in his work.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.560
That's what

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.160
a Mrs. Fu should do.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.800
Thank you.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.560
Thank you.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.200
Fu Yudong!

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.480
Are you retaliating against me?

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.160
Not at all.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.600
Li Daoqi and Lady Wan

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.480
signed the contract.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.680
Lady Wan insisted on it.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.320
What could I do?

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.360
So whatever Lady Wan wants,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.600
you'll do it, is that it?

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.440
Now

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.440
you're bringing in a fake wife,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.000
what does that make me?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.960
What am I to you?

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.360
It's just acting, it's not real!

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.000
What if the acting becomes real?

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.200
How is that possible?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.720
Things are different now,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.800
you know that clearly.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.680
You think I should agree

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.000
and I should just agree?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:39.680
Let me tell you,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.720
I've tried my best.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.160
I told Lady Wan

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.320
that my wife is also an influencer.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:43.880
I was thinking

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.080
of bringing you to the livestream

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.000
to help

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.880
you somewhat.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.400
But Lady Wan said,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.520
since you're not from the same company,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.480
you're with Tide Media,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.800
there exists a conflict of interest

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.360
between the two companies.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.600
What can I do about that?

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.240
So you're saying

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.360
I'm holding you back,

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.360
I've become

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.000
a stumbling block in your career,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.520
that's what you mean, right?

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.360
That's not what I mean!

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.400
How could you interpret it that way?

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.480
That's exactly what you mean!

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.160
I just want you to cooperate

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.800
with my work,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.960
is it so difficult?

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.640
I didn't mind

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.600
about the rice cake story before.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.200
During your livestream the other day,

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.800
for your sales,

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.560
you used me as

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.360
a tool to talk about having children,

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.560
and you didn't mind.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.920
Now when I need to work,

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.040
to cooperate with my work,

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040
is it so difficult?

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.120
Fu Yudong, these are completely different things!

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.240
How can they be the same?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.240
When I talked about you,

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.560
nobody knew you were my husband,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.160
right?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.080
Even if people online

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:23.960
wanted to judge you,

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.360
they didn't know who you were.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.920
But if

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.920
you get a fake wife,

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.880
everyone will assume

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.280
I'm not your wife, right?

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.840
The same logic applies.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.680
Nobody online

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.080
knows who I am,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920
let alone

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.400
who my wife is.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.280
In the future,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.400
if there are any problems,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.000
they'll attack that person,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.840
not you.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.360
I'm protecting you!

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.320
You're so amazing,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.400
thinking so much about me!

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.640
Well, I'm telling you I don't agree.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.760
Don't I have the right to disagree?

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.560
It's so frustrating!

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.520
Fu Yudong,

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.480
I think

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.680
since we came

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.520
from Canada...

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.160
Fine,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.600
let's talk about Canada.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:07.960
I was living in Canada before,

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.240
and I was happy.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.880
When you said you wanted to return to China,

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.440
I supported you, alright?

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.360
We came back together.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.320
Do you know

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.760
how much pressure I've been under?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:16.680
After coming back,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.640
I had to consider your feelings,

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.680
consider your father's feelings,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.640
your mother's feelings.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.440
I had to think about

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.160
all of them.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:21.920
Every day out there,

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.760
fixing things for people,

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.400
have I complained once?

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.760
All these things,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.920
I've dealt with myself.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.880
Now Li Daoqi for this matter

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.080
has put everything on the line.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.760
How can I not help him out?

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.520
I understand now,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.360
Fu Yudong,

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.080
I used to think

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.640
when you came back from Canada with me,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.960
you genuinely supported me,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.360
wanted to back me up.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.680
But now I see

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.480
you've got it all calculated.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720
You're constantly calculating

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.640
what you've sacrificed,

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.680
what you've given up,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:58.640
right?

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.720
Whatever.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.040
Since you think

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.360
everyone else is more important than me,

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.680
Li Daoqi,

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.320
Lady Wan,

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.880
your company, fine.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.400
I used to be

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.280
your everything,

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.040
but now I realize

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.520
I'm nothing.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.600
It's a simple thing.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.080
Do whatever you want.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.240
Why are you making such a big deal out of this?

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:13.920
I'm not.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.680
Do whatever you want.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.520
I won't be

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.280
a stumbling block for you anymore.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.800
So just do whatever you want.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.360
Fine,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.200
do what you like.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.680
I won't bother you anymore.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.840
Don't bother me either.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.440
Damn it!

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.560
Mr. Fu, Mr. Li, I need to go.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880
What you just said

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.080
was really inappropriate.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.520
Even Michael looked embarrassed.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.520
Listen, Yudong,

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.760
if he had just argued with me directly,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.960
that would've been fine.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:18.880
I just can't stand

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.920
his passive-aggressive

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.520
attitude.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.720
It makes

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.040
my blood boil.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.640
You're the CEO,

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.120
and I'm the legal representative.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.400
He's just a professional manager.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.840
Who does he think he is?

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.680
Alright, don't get angry.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.960
I'm not really angry.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.440
I'm just showing him who's boss.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.840
Plus, I want him to pass

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.240
this message to Xing Kai.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440
What's wrong with Xing Kai now?

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.920
He's a sly old fox.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.680
He won't move without a payoff.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.200
He hasn't paid me a penny yet,

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.920
waiting for my money to come in first.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.120
How are things on your end?

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.160
Any difficulties?

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.360
No difficulties.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.880
It's just that

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.840
Cheng Man has set up all these

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.640
financial products and funds,

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.520
and such things.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.320
I withdrew in the morning,

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.880
but they can't give it to me in the afternoon.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.200
It'll take several days.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.360
Don't worry,

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.320
we can work something out.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.600
If you're having troubles, let me know

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.120
and we'll figure it out together.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.560
Great, if you want to help,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.040
how about

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:35.960
treating me to dinner tonight?

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.720
I can't.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.280
Zhang Ran is waiting for me at home.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.520
So you were just talking nonsense earlier,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.360
all fake.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.680
You're just like him,

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.440
I tell you.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.360
You're all deceivers.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.040
The difficulties I mentioned

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.280
aren't about that.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.640
Listen,

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.200
when others make valid points,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.080
we should listen.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.720
If they're wrong,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.480
no need to butt heads with them.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.600
Yeah, I get it.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.680
I know what I'm doing.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.440
Don't worry.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.040
Mr. Fu,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.840
when you're at the mall on Double 11,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.600
you'll see the big LED screens.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.800
Just stand there and wait a bit.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.680
The screen cycles through ads,

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.120
and after a while

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.240
Yudong'll come up.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.760
Really?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.720
Really.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.840
Yudong on the LED screen?

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.920
We bought ad space.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.520
Yudong's doing commercials now?

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.000
Yes.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.560
He's the face of our company.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.560
You two have really made it.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.400
Face of the company?

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.960
We should celebrate.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.400
[Two more dishes coming right up.]

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.040
No rush at all, really.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.280
I'm just starving.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.320
Almost ready. Wait a second.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.520
Such a big day.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.840
Why didn't Yudong come with you?

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.400
He...

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.360
He was supposed to.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.000
[Well, we were actually]

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.680
[on our way here together,]

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.800
but halfway someone called him

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.640
and he had to go.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.240
Since he's the face of the company,

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.280
he's busier than me.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.080
He's rushed off his feet these days.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.880
Really busy.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.480
Dishes are up. Let's celebrate

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.320
before you starve to death.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.160
Time to eat.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.160
Let's have a few drinks.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.080
Great. Let's drink a few more today.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:11.760
No problem.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.360
A proper celebration for you both.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.560
Here, let's drink.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.760
Come on.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.360
Flying Millet,

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.120
welcome to my livestream.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.120
Thanks for the support.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.480
Really?

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.680
You noticed?

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.200
I am a bit tired.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.400
I had a small

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.840
clash with someone,

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.640
but that's normal.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.960
Did you fight with your husband?

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.640
Couples argue all the time.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.120
I mean,

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.600
in relationships

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.920
especially marriages,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.080
no one can

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.000
stay calm

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.280
and peaceful every

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.720
single day.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.600
I often

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.720
think

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.400
marriage is like

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.720
a savings

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.200
account at

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.560
the bank.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.720
Those happy

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.640
moments

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.920
are the "money" you deposit.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.600
When you argue,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.080
it's like you're withdrawing

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.200
from that account,

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.800
because when you're fighting

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.560
and emotions run high,

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:21.880
you just want to

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.200
tear the other person apart.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.240
In that moment,

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.960
no one can't remember

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.280
the good times you've shared.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.440
No one.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.360
But when you calm down

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.200
and think about it,

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.520
you have to rely on

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.840
those good memories to get through it.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.200
Otherwise,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.320
how do you keep marriage going?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.720
Enjoy and cherish the good times.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.280
When you're arguing,

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.640
remind yourself of those good moments.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.320
If we can

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.320
all do that,

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.440
life feels a lot lighter

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.400
and happier.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.280
But if you

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.680
let negative emotions

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.640
take over

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.720
and walk around

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.200
with a sour face all day,

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.400
it's bad for you

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.760
and the people around you.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.360
You're back?

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.240
What's up? You're in such a good mood.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.920
What's that you're holding?

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.200
A gift, for you.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.640
Why are you giving me a gift?

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.720
This is your favorite brand.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.200
No more shopping online from overseas.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.840
I'll buy at the boutique for you.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.800
Today's a good day.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.880
We have to celebrate.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.800
We signed the Double 11

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.880
livestream contract with Lady Wan.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.440
You did?

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.480
Didn't you say

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.040
there was a big funding gap?

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.080
All taken care of.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.160
I handled it.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.240
Like you said,

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.000
I've learned a lot.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.960
Congratulations.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.000
Pretty impressive, huh?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.680
I knew you could pull it off.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.280
What's this?

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.000
It's pork my mom stewed.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.160
She already made it.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.880
If I didn't take it, she'd be heartbroken.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.480
I know,

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.840
but you've been so busy lately.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.160
You need to watch what you eat.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.080
Got it.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.240
Don't worry.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.320
I'm gonna take a shower.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.800
Okay.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.880
You not coming?

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.720
I'm doing the dishes.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.560
[Shower time.]

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.080
[What]

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.640
[is marriage really?]

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.280
Maybe you can only answer that question

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.320
when you've lived through it all.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.600
Right now, when

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.520
negative emotions come flooding in,

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.600
I don't know what to do either.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.240
Sometimes I just feel

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.480
really tired.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.080
But I've

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.440
had truly joyful

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.800
moments in my marriage too.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.040
How can marriage be all sweet

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.160
with no bitter?

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.320
That wouldn't be fair either.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.760
So arguing is normal.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.680
No, I'll pass on the drink, Mr. Lin.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.000
Come on, have some.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.520
I told you that you're

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.760
the best

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.240
streamer I've ever seen.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.560
I'm flattered.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.440
You've already

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.520
figured out your character.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.000
I actually didn't want to

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.280
be the bitter wife.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.080
I wasn't trying to

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.440
trash-talk my husband.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.720
I'm not asking you to.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.760
You're better as the independent woman type.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.480
Didn't you say

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.080
since I'm married,

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.520
that image doesn't really work?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.880
Get a divorce then.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.560
Divorce is

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.040
a huge boost for female streamers.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.000
[No, wait, Mr. Lin.]

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.560
Something just

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.000
happened yesterday

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.840
and I vented a bit.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.520
We're nowhere near divorce.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.840
Ran,

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.920
did you see how hyped everyone was

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.480
in the comment section?

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.000
[Queen on her own.]

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.400
Queen on her own.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.240
You're the chosen divorce icon.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.680
Don't waste this opportunity.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:46.840
I'll think about it.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.840
When are you divorcing that freeloader guy?

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.400
Why do you

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.760
all want me to get divorced?

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.240
Can't you wish me something good?

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.200
Let's drop it.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.000
Wow,

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.240
you're settling in pretty fast.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.800
Your dad got me this job.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.360
How could I not work hard?

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.120
Also,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.960
I wasn't

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.200
very nice that day.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.920
I never took it to heart anyway.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:05.840
So,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.000
consider this your first wish

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.840
granted.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:08.800
It's nothing.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.160
I made the decision for you

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.360
without asking.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.440
Just think of me

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.640
as your genie from the lamp.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.880
Have you seen Pirates of the Caribbean?

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.400
The Black Pearl

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.440
has a monkey, right?

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.200
Let's get a boat.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.600
Deal, that's wish number two then.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.200
Right, and a monkey too.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.880
You actually got a boat?

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.080
Impressed?

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:35.720
Yeah.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.080
Where'd you get it?

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.560
Found it by the beach.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.240
There are many

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.680
abandoned boats there.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.520
You really are a genie?

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:48.960
You just figured it out?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.200
Don't tell anyone,

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.240
or they'll all come asking for favors.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.920
I just want you to

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.280
open yourself up

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.760
to the world.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.280
[Don't shut yourself away.]

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.640
[It's so unfair to yourself.]

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.680
[And no more night shifts now.]

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
We can help out

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.880
at Xinying's restaurant more often.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.320
What I said earlier, I meant it.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.280
I don't buy it.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.280
[Tomorrow, get those ingredients...]

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.000
Don't lie to me.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.040
I can tell.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:22.679
Bye.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.400
Bye.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:24.800
Happy?

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:26.840
Good work today.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.280
Thanks, bye.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.280
Happy's such a good boy.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.480
So many customers

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.560
[loved him today.]

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:42.760
So cute.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.280
Xinying,

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.360
why don't you keep Happy?

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:45.320
Okay?

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.960
As a store mascot?

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.159
He brings you

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:56.120
customers.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.640
[Kaiyang can drop him off]

00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.960
[on his way]

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.120
[to work]

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.080
[and pick]

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.560
[him up after.]

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.160
Wanna stay here, Happy?

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.280
[Do you like me?]

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.600
[Do you?]

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:11.920
[Get him a girlfriend.]

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.200
Look, he's smiling.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.360
He likes me.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.760
Okay, you're staying.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.200
From now on

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.240
you'll be here with me,

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:17.960
okay?

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.640
Your dad will

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.760
visit after work.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.880
I heard that.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.320
[So he's staying here then.]

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.200
If you're free on weekends,

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.360
come help me out.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.800
What's the hesitation?

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.440
For free? We're busy on weekends.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.680
I'll make you deluxe staff meals.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.360
How's that?

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.560
We work all week

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.480
and do chores for you on weekends,

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.720
just for malatang?

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.240
You're ruthless.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.080
Take it or leave it.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.560
We're happy to help.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.360
[Right, Kaiyang?]

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.840
[Even if it's for free.]

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.280
[Stop feeding him that stuff.]

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.840
He won't even touch his dog food later.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.640
Happy's been pulling in

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.800
customers for me

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.480
and making me money.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.440
[That's a reward for him.]

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.480
Go eat.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.560
Business is booming, huh?

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:25.960
How does it feel?

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.160
Dreams come true.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.160
Entering

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.560
the food business.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.360
How do you feel?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.200
It really feels like a dream.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.920
When I think

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.440
about our time in Canada,

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.400
[it feels like a past life.]

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.160
I spent so much money

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.280
in Canada on those props

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.240
and that LED screen.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.960
[Basically throwing money at a dream,]

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.360
just to bring everyone together.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.560
Now it feels kinda stupid.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.640
[It's not stupid.]

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.320
[Dreams can't be]

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.320
[measured in money.]

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.200
You did the right thing,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.120
though our dreams

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.480
back then were kind of naïve.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.840
Do you remember?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.960
[I was totally lost.]

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.240
[That's your line.]

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.080
[I didn't even know where I was]

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.400
[or where I was headed.]

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.720
Remember? That poor Mr. Liang

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.800
was acting

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.480
out the scene with you.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.520
And Chen Xi

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.720
holding that huge prop rock.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.200
So funny.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.280
And that line.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.680
I know this can't be changed

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.200
[and fate is inevitable.]

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.240
[I supported you, Kaiyang.]

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.120
[You were right.]

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:33.800
[There was a time]

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.920
[when I was desperate to see the stars.]

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.040
So I bought a ticket to

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.960
New Zealand and stayed there

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:39.840
for two months.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.040
[That night sky was unreal.]

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.880
It felt like the stars

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.720
were right in front of you,

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.120
So bright and so dense.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.520
It was insanely beautiful.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.680
If there's such a thing

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.520
as the Milky Way,

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.160
that's exactly what I was looking at.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.080
That's it.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.840
[The Milky Way?]

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.320
Fran, if I had your life,

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:01.920
I'd be

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.640
smiling in my sleep.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.360
[Flying halfway across the world for stars?]

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.160
That's crazy.

Once you live that life,

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:10.880
you'll understand.

we ordinary people can't

Stop it.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.320
Actually, I think

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.320
a lot of

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.680
so-called dreams

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.320

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.400
don't really cost money.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.520
I've seen

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.240
[people online posting sunrise photos]

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.720
[from our Lucheng beach.]

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.680
They look amazing.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.360
Have you ever watched the sunrise here?

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.280
You?

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.000
[Look,]

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.240
we've watched sunrises in so many places

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.160
around the world, right?

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.880
But never once in our own hometown.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.520
That just feels wrong.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.440
I'll go watch it with you.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:00.960
Let's go then.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.040
Let's go.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.480
Come on, get up.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.320
Legs up.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.720
Move, you two.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.680
Move.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.760
Go.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.800
The chair has me trapped.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.280
Kaiyang, slow down.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.840
Ride faster.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840
Catch up to him, Fran.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.040
Avenge me.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.000
I passed you.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.520
I think the internet photos

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.400
totally lied to me.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.320
The photos didn't look like this.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.440
It's pitch dark here.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.800
The rocks are hard as hell.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.920
If the sunrise isn't spectacular,

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.000
I'll feel bad for dragging you here.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.480
Don't say that.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.560
[Listen,]

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.360
[there was a writer]

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
[who once said that life isn't]

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.840
[measured in]

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.400
years, months, or days,

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.840
but in a handful of moments.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.160
[That writer is you,]

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.080
isn't it? So dramatic.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.440
Shut up.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.720
Just drink your beer.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.280
I spent ten years in Canada.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.680
That makes

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.080
up almost half

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.680
my life.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.240
But how many moments are there really?

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.880
I left Lucheng when I was young too.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.200
So I never felt much attachment to this city.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.480
Sometimes

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.960
I see celebrity interviews where

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.760
they talk about their deep love

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.160
[for their hometowns,]

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.800
[and I just couldn't relate.]

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.720
But coming back this time,

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.360
I'm finally rebuilding

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.240
the connection.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.800
When did you go abroad?

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.720
I'm not being mysterious.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.960
I honestly can't quite remember.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.520
It was so long ago.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.360
[I went abroad when I was little.]

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.720
You said your time abroad

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.320
takes up half your life,

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.520
but I feel like

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.760
my entire life so far

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.360
has been spent overseas.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.800
Sabishii.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.520
Sabishii?

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.480
Sounds like a curse word.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:48.680
[Kaiyang,]

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.440
[it's Japanese.]

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.120
It means lonely.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.560
Sabishii.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.160
Very sabishii.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:11.840
Cheers.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.960
Let's toast to ourselves. Come on.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.840
To destiny!

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.440
To the sunrise!

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.440
When will the sun come up?

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.520
Soon.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.640
Trust me.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.280
Keep your eyes on that direction,

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.600
on that mountain.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:34.880
Right there.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.200
It's over there.
