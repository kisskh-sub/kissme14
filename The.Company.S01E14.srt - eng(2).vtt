00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960
This Kun Blade
was found in the lotus pond.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:52.840
No way.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.719
The Kun Blade is Lan's family heirloom.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.990
She treasures it more than her own life.
She would never let it leave her side.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.359
Could it be that Lan

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.239
met her end here?

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.000
Lu Feng.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.639
I will go help him.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.639
Lan.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.120
Lu Feng.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.240
Lan.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:19.800
Calm down.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.879
Let go of me.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.719
Try to calm yourself.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.719
I will help you search.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.879
Wait.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.560
This is the Kun Blade.

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:42.400
The Kun Blade is here,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.280
but Lan is not.

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:48.479
Lan.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.080
Bizhi.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.560
Take the blade. I will pull him up.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.240
All right.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.680
That will do.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.860
Do not come any closer.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.319
In the dead of night,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.120
three grown men sneaking around
to look for a blade.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.280
Believe it or not,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.800
if I shout right now,

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.790
a whole squad of guards
will arrive at once.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.080
Guangling Residence is full of masters.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.599
When that happens,
none of you will leave alive.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.719
You are right.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.199
No one will leave alive.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.599
In the middle of the night,

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.639
a young woman,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.639
alone in Guangling Residence,

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.879
runs into three suspicious men like us,

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.199
yet you did not cry out.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.360
So what are you afraid of?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.400
What is inside your bundle?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.080
I…

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.790
There are night patrols
in the rear courtyard.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.919
Let us step aside and talk.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.560
The two in the water, come up as well.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.280
Stop flailing.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.439
The water is this shallow.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.639
Lan could not be in there.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.400
Come up first.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.680
Young lady.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.879
The three of us are not bad people.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.400
You do not need to be afraid.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.560
As for who you are,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.759
we truly do not care.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.279
Please return the blade to me.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.839
I know you are not villains.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.980
With so much gold and treasure in this residence,
you did not steal any of it.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.959
Yet you came
for this battered little blade.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.639
You must have your reasons.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.290
But that is none of my concern.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.050
As long as you help me
with one small favor,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.360
I promise I will return the blade to you,

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.240
and keep this quiet.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.920
How do you want us to help you?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.040
Since I was young,

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:44.160
I have served
in this residence as a maid.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.020
I have now learned
that my parents are gravely ill,

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.240
and I do not know
how much time they have left.

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:50.959
All I wish, in this lifetime,

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:54.439
is to see my father and mother
one last time.

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.000
Enough.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.660
You want us to help you escape
from Guangling Residence, right?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.040
Not just the residence.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.160
I need to leave Lin'an City.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.399
In Lin'an City,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.970
Guangling Residence holds immense power.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.759
Nearly all the city guards
are in their pocket.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.920
Even if someone escapes the residence,

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:09.170
they cannot escape the city.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.160
That is why

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:11.800
I need your help.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:14.879
Young lady,

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.600
do you have
a colleague here named Xia Zelan?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.959
Xia as in summer,

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:21.680
Ze as in marsh,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.720
Lan as in orchid.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.319
A colleague?

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.600
You talk in a very odd way.

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:30.240
Xia Zelan...

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.079
I do not know her.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.639
Then please think again.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:36.079
She works in the back kitchen.
She is a cook.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.160
I already said I do not know her.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.040
Young lady.

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.519
I am truly begging you.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.720
Then please think again for me.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.079
In this lotus pond,

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:46.360
was there a young girl
who once fell into the water?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.439
She was young and beautiful.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.920
She liked wearing green.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.000
Please, think carefully.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.959
I am begging you.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.380
Once you enter a noble household,
it is as deep as the sea.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:54.990
From then on,
even old love becomes a stranger.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.130
Once you enter this residence,
do not expect to leave,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.879
unless

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.920
you die.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.680
That is not always true.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.720
Not always.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.519
You are still young.
Do not speak so harshly.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.680
That is none of your concern.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:09.800
One answer.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.780
Will you help me or not?

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.759
We will.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.759
Really?

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.600
But we are lost right now.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.920
There are guards everywhere
in the residence.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.990
We cannot get you out like this.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.680
Do not worry.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.590
I know this place well.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.519
Follow me.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.079
Let us get out first.

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:25.990
You think we will lose our way?

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.120
We will not.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:31.160
Hurry.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.279
You really are amazing.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.660
There is not a single guard around.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.879
You were just lucky to run into me.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.420
We take the side path to the back gate.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.519
It is the fastest and safest route.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.319
What are you doing?

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.420
There are people everywhere.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.570
Didn't you say you knew this place well?

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.980
We are incredibly lucky, aren't we?

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.100
Running into so many guards.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.680
Relax.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.390
Wait a bit longer.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.959
Wait for what?

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.360
Just wait, that's all.

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.079
Do not talk.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.160
Fire!

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:10.240
There is a fire!

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.560
Over there!

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.279
Someone get help!

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.759
This is what we were waiting for.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:13.360
Go.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.519
Go.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360
Hurry.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.680
Keep your heads down.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.720
You are too tall.

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:26.720
We finally made it out.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.279
Jin's plan really worked.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.439
Who is Jin?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.120
That's none of your business.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.150
You think I didn't notice?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.820
The one who shouted
about the fire just now.

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.399
You must have planned this
for a long time.

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:36.420
Weren't you afraid she'd suffer for it?

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:36.839
I...

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.720
You should worry first

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.360
about how to get me past the city gate.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.519
Let me warn you,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.000
if the gate guards discover us,
that is a capital crime.

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:49.399
Are all maids this bad-tempered?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.839
The city gate is just ahead.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.380
Are we really going to be fine?

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:06.000
We are merchants
doing business in Lin'an City.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.150
What could possibly go wrong?

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:11.200
What are you grinning about?

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.990
It used to be you playing the master
while I played the attendant.

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:17.000
Today it is finally my turn
to be in charge.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.920
Not used to it?

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.860
Then let us switch back.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:19.680
No chance.

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:21.759
Being the master feels far too good.

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:23.360
Zhi,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.240
tell the horse to pick up the pace.

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:29.399
Driver.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:31.120
Faster.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.560
All right.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.279
Stop the cart.

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.159
Routine inspection.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.840
Get down.

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:41.440
Get down.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.759
Move it.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:43.480
Get down.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.080
Nothing here.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.919
Hold on.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:04.279
(Stepmadam of Guangling)
Lei.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.399
Here, Old Madam.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.399
Go check the carriage.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:07.960
Yes.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.900
(Lei Xiao, Guangling Residence Guard)

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.919
This way, please.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:40.879
Old Madam.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.120
The Princess has been found.

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:43.759
The Princess?

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:45.639
Was she not a maid?

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.220
(Princess Yan Rong)

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.080
Let go of me.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.879
Let go.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.279
Let go of me.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.279
Your Highness.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.130
I beg your forgiveness for the offense.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.390
The Old Madam saw that Your Highness
did not return all night

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.790
and could not set her mind at ease.

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.120
Rong.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.080
Did you like the Western Regions sachet
I gave you before?

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:25.480
Its fragrance is rare
even in the Central Plains.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.159
I gave it to you alone.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.320
If hiding in a carriage
could make its scent fade,

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.120
then it would be a cheap trinket.

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.879
How could I ever present
such a thing to a Princess?

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.200
Old Madam.

00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:46.159
When you gave me that sachet,
you had already foreseen today, hadn't you?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.519
To you, am I no more than a pet,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.919
or am I truly your granddaughter?

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.279
Rong.

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:59.960
You are no longer just my granddaughter.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:03.320
You are about
to become Imperial Princess Yan Rong,

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:05.320
married to the Emperor of Great Wu.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.759
What an honor that is.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.399
So many people

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.279
would beg for such a chance.

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.519
The Emperor of Great Wu is nearly sixty.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.360
He is debauched beyond restraint.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.960
The palace is littered with the dead.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.320
Who does not know this?

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:19.600
You…

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.559
You are sending me there to die.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.200
Old Madam.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.480
If you still acknowledge me
as your granddaughter,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.480
I beg you,

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:32.840
do not send me
to that barbaric land to suffer.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.590
His Majesty could not bear
to sacrifice the Imperial Princess,

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:37.279
so I am made the scapegoat instead.

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:38.600
That is not fair.

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.000
I cannot bear it either.

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:49.480
I can only lament

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.799
that an imperial order cannot be defied.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.159
Take the Princess to my carriage.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:06.279
Let go of me!

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.600
Old Madam.

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:16.600
Those three men...

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.080
Deal with them on the spot.

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:20.799
Make it clean.

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:21.960
Yes.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080
Return to the residence.

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:33.600
Move.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.240
I am leaving this to you.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.759
Understood.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.210
Take them away.

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:41.360
Move.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:41.639
Hurry.

00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:42.039
Move.

00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:42.679
Move.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.240
Move.

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:05.360
Seize them.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:05.960
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.080
Go.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.720
Move.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.159
Hurry.

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:12.000
Move.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:16.919
Quick.

00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:17.759
This way.

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:18.720
This way.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.720
Good thing no one followed us.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.610
Good thing I secretly grabbed
some pepper powder last night.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.000
It saved us at a critical moment.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.559
Give me a break.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.600
Be glad you did not get it
all over your own face.

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:36.440
The Kun Blade is still
with the Princess.

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:37.480
What do we do now?

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:40.360
I knew from the start
she was not simple.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.879
A servant girl
would never have such a temper.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.710
And someone even helped
draw the guards away for her.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.080
There was nothing else we could do.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.490
The situation was too urgent,
we had no choice but to agree.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.120
So what now?

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.240
Let us lie low for now.

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:30.840
Old Madam.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.080
My Lord.

00:14:40.039 --> 00:14:41.799
All these years you have been away,

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.000
I, a mere woman,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.960
have carried the burdens
of the entire residence on my own.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.559
Now at last, we have been granted
an auspicious match.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:53.559
Yan Rong

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.799
has brought honor to the family name.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.519
She can also bring benefit
to the world at large.

00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:03.960
You would not blame me for easing
His Majesty's burden before the Empress,

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.200
and securing this opportunity,
would you?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.720
Old Madam.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:10.840
The Princess

00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:12.679
has blood all over her forehead.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.120
This child…

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.480
She has no regard for her own health.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.590
How could she ever become
the Empress of Great Wu?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.520
There is no helping it.

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:32.440
She is far too reckless.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.159
Lock her up.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.279
Yes.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.759
Pass on my orders.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.360
Keep the Princess under strict guard.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.720
Select only the finest skin balms,

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:45.960
and the best Su brocade silks.

00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:48.000
Spare no expense.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.799
All for the Princess to be content

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:53.919
when she departs for Great Wu.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.279
Yes, Old Madam.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.919
I am tired.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.960
You may leave.

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:18.399
Your Highness.

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:21.080
Madam asks that you return
and rest properly.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.119
Do not worry.

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:07.200
In my condition,

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.559
I could not run even if I tried.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.700
(A few days later)

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.359
Is it really appropriate
to dress like this?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.980
There have been
many exam candidates lately.

00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:47.780
Disguising ourselves
as scholars is safer.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:48.680
Move.

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:51.519
There are soldiers.

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:52.720
It is fine.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.640
Why does this wanted poster
look so much like Su?

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.500
(Wanted)

00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.759
Right?

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:00.920
Look.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.480
Why is there only my portrait?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.880
That is hardly fair.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.720
Move.

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:07.240
You three.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.119
Stop.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:10.079
Step aside.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.800
What brings you to the capital?

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.680
Reporting to the officer,
we have come for the provincial exam.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:17.640
You.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.720
Turn your face this way.

00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:27.200
Ten years of bitter study,

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.200
all for...

00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:33.200
It's okay.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.680
My entire family died of consumption.

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:39.759
I sold off all our belongings

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.960
just to make it here.

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.519
Thankfully, a few old classmates

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:46.000
still remembered me.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.160
They were willing to come
take the exam with me.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.640
This time, I will surely pass.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.039
Su,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.920
once this exam is over,
we will head back.

00:18:58.119 --> 00:18:59.160
All right, help him along.

00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:00.079
Move, quickly.

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:00.559
Thank you.

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:03.079
Thanks.

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:08.920
Enough.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.640
Stop coughing.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.680
They are gone.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.200
I am actually coughing.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.920
I think I caught a chill.

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:18.599
I still need to go
to Guangling Residence to find Lan.

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:21.799
And rescue Her Highness.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.039
She has been locked up. It is pitiful.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.790
If we want to save Her Highness,

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.119
we will need some tactics.

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:45.680
Your Highness.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.799
The master has prepared
many dowries for you.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.160
Will you not take a look?

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.839
Then at least have some water.

00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:55.799
You have not eaten for days.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.290
I will not know how to explain this
to the old madam.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.000
Where is Jin?

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.279
Jin, she...

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.039
What happened to her?

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.559
She is my maid.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.640
I ordered her to help me.
She is not at fault.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.559
Why?

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.400
Why must they wipe her out completely?

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.200
Please have some tea.

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:47.240
Is it done?

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:48.519
Can you leave now?

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:51.650
Do not touch those flowers.

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:53.279
Yes.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:20.920
Jin...

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:52.839
Who is there?

00:21:55.599 --> 00:21:56.279
Who?

00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:15.880
They are not dead.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.799
They only passed out.

00:22:17.319 --> 00:22:18.640
Your Highness, let us go now.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.880
You all

00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:22.880
actually kept your promise,

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.359
and really came back to save me.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.640
I never expected the ones
I could rely on most

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.119
would be a bunch of thieves like you.

00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:28.900
Hold it right there.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.190
Let me make this clear one last time.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.960
We are not thieves.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.200
Enough talking.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:34.920
Your Highness, we need to leave now.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.000
Thank you.

00:22:49.519 --> 00:22:51.680
I can tell you are all good people.

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:54.079
You had already escaped safely,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.880
yet you still risked coming back for me.

00:22:56.599 --> 00:22:57.799
I am truly grateful.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.000
But Jin died because of me.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.290
I cannot drag you down as well.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.799
So please leave at once.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.480
No.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.599
We go together.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.160
Do you remember the way
to the back gate?

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.680
I will draw the guards away for you.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.559
Who goes there?

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:12.240
Quick, get help.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:12.799
We have been spotted.

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:13.240
Someone has taken the Princess.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:13.820
What do we do?

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:14.720
Men.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.480
Get reinforcements.

00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:16.559
Hurry. Over there.

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:17.000
There she is.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.960
Move, that way.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.240
Quick.

00:23:23.359 --> 00:23:24.119
Who is that?

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.590
She seems to be calling
for us to follow her.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:27.680
There.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:28.440
Hurry.

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:28.960
Go.

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:32.960
Seize them.

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:33.759
Now.

00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:41.960
There is another door here.

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:45.300
Your Highness, we will do this.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.279
Come on, help move it.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.119
Thank you.

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:54.079
Go, now.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.759
She has not said a word the entire way.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.519
Can she even speak?

00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:20.440
Could she be mute?

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:22.599
Where is she taking us?

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:06.590
The tea supplied to Guangling Residence,

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.400
was it roasted by you?

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.480
Hungry...

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:26.079
Thank you.

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:48.039
So it turns out

00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:51.559
the camellias on my desk all these years

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.200
were sent by her.

00:25:58.079 --> 00:25:59.319
How did Your Highness know?

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.990
I have never cared
for other flowers since childhood.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.990
Only camellias
have ever been my favorite.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.519
But the gardeners in the residence

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.599
could never grow camellias so exquisite.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.119
Then, a few years ago,

00:26:16.599 --> 00:26:17.559
fresh camellias

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.200
began appearing on my desk every day.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.279
Each bloom full of life.

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:26.079
I once thought

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.960
that even if this household

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.240
was nothing more
than a cage trapping me,

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.759
even if my own family

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.519
never truly cared about me,

00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:44.079
that single bouquet of camellias

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.000
at least

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.640
gave me a trace of warmth called home.

00:26:51.119 --> 00:26:53.839
At least someone cared
about what I truly loved.

00:26:55.319 --> 00:26:56.440
I just never imagined

00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:59.559
that this one small kindness

00:27:01.359 --> 00:27:03.839
would come from a complete stranger.

00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:07.559
How bitterly ironic.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.519
Thank you.

00:27:36.319 --> 00:27:37.839
Then I will accept it. Thank you.

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:38.839
Thank you.

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:41.720
Thank you.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:00.799
Wait.

00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:22.759
You are Xia Zelan.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.440
I will never forget the taste
of your fried rice.

00:28:50.119 --> 00:28:51.400
I am Lu Feng.

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:54.519
Back at Tianguang Market,

00:28:56.079 --> 00:28:57.240
you made fried rice for me.

00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:01.440
We ran a stall together.

00:29:02.039 --> 00:29:04.480
We lived together
by the River of Oblivion.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.660
She came out of Tianguang Market
and remembers none of that.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.759
Do not frighten her.

00:29:08.759 --> 00:29:09.279
Lu Feng.

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:12.799
Lan.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.519
Have you truly forgotten me?

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:15.319
I am Lu Feng.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.039
The Lu Feng you once cared
for and encouraged.

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:20.119
Lan.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:22.759
Lan.

00:29:23.319 --> 00:29:24.480
You are frightening her.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.160
Lan.

00:29:28.599 --> 00:29:29.440
How did this happen?

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.680
I will go find a physician.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.759
Do not go.

00:29:36.839 --> 00:29:38.000
She is not mute?

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.480
Your Highness.

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:42.400
My body

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.000
is already at its limit.

00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:47.839
It cannot be cured.

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:50.440
Your Highness, however, are still young.

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:52.279
You barely managed to escape.

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:55.279
You must never fall back
into their hands.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:56.720
No.

00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:58.780
I know the finest physician
in Lin'an City.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.599
No matter what, I will save you.

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:02.119
Lan.

00:30:02.119 --> 00:30:03.200
Slowly.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:05.200
Help her sit down first.

00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:06.519
Careful.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.680
Careful.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.000
Careful.

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:10.079
Lan.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.160
Your Highness.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.359
Please stay.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.279
I

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.680
still have so many things

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.200
I must tell you.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.960
Otherwise,

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:33.400
I fear there will not be enough time.

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.599
I…

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.279
Why do you call yourself a servant?

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.799
Even if you once did business
with my household,

00:30:42.039 --> 00:30:43.680
there is no need to humble yourself so.

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:49.559
Back then,

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:53.359
I was a kitchen steward
at Guangling Residence.

00:30:54.079 --> 00:30:55.599
But after committing an offense,

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.799
I nearly died under the rod.

00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:00.559
That very night,

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.440
the child in my womb

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.559
saved my life.

00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:07.119
Strike.

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:33.160
Stop.

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:52.160
Please save my child.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.240
Push.

00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:03.920
Breathe.

00:32:06.319 --> 00:32:07.200
Push harder.

00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:10.079
One more push.

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:19.319
Take a breath.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.480
Push.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.200
How is it?

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.000
No.

00:32:26.079 --> 00:32:27.160
Yes.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.720
Push.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.039
My child...

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:14.599
My child...

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.519
Have some water.

00:33:28.839 --> 00:33:30.079
Where is my child?

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:32.160
Young Lady Xia.

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:34.640
Please do not grieve.

00:33:35.839 --> 00:33:36.960
Your child

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:40.880
is gone.

00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:45.039
Impossible.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.119
Impossible.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.880
Last night,

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.440
he was still kicking inside me.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.400
The Master showed mercy

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.240
and spared your life.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:03.920
Later,

00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:06.000
someone will take you away.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.920
You will be sent to Nanjiang for labor.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.039
Nanjiang is harsh,

00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:12.559
but at least

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.960
you will survive.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.599
Move. All of you, keep up.

00:34:46.599 --> 00:34:47.199
Dead?

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.480
If you are not dead, get up.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.599
Get up.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.400
Get up!

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.400
Stop hitting her.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.440
She is elderly.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.650
She can barely walk as it is.

00:34:57.679 --> 00:34:59.039
How can she stand if you beat her?

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.440
Little wench,

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:02.639
you have a sharp tongue.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.840
Then you help her walk.

00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:05.239
Help her.

00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:06.519
Get up!

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.000
Move it.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Move.

00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:14.800
Go.

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:16.320
Move, now.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.000
What are you staring at up there?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.119
Move it.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.119
Young lady.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.760
Do not worry about me.
I am not getting out alive.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.480
Hurry.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.199
Hold on.

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:26.880
Move.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.000
No matter what,

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:29.480
you must survive.

00:35:32.559 --> 00:35:33.599
At first,

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.159
I still clung to my dignity as a cook.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.199
I would eat nothing but bamboo shoots,

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.199
and drink nothing but pure spring water.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.800
But

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.639
I underestimated how harsh Nanjiang was.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.440
In the end, I was driven to

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.400
eating tree roots,

00:35:50.599 --> 00:35:51.599
and leaves,

00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:56.000
even dead rats.

00:35:57.559 --> 00:35:58.920
We walked from summer

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.880
into winter.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.599
That night,

00:36:04.559 --> 00:36:05.960
there was a heavy snowfall.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.199
He died.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.159
What a nuisance.

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:15.840
Get up.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.639
Freezing to death saved him the trouble.

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:45.360
Do not eat it.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.200
This place is shrouded
in miasma year round.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.480
The frost forms with poison.

00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:51.320
Do not eat it.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.960
It was then

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.920
that I finally understood.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.480
The poison was in the ice.

00:37:04.519 --> 00:37:05.960
Carp and licorice

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.519
were never enough to kill.

00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:10.880
What truly killed

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.719
were the people closest to the Madam.

00:37:16.159 --> 00:37:17.079
And I

00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:21.199
was nothing more than a scapegoat.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.840
The Madam of Guangling

00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:29.360
was murdered by her own younger sister.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.960
That sister
was the Stepmadam of Guangling.

00:37:33.079 --> 00:37:34.599
She killed my grandmother?

00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:38.360
I should have realized it sooner.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.920
She always looked so righteous.

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:43.430
If she could kill her own sister,
how could she spare me?

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:46.239
All these years,

00:37:48.239 --> 00:37:49.840
you have suffered so much.

00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:52.440
At first,

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.320
I thought

00:37:55.199 --> 00:37:57.519
it would be fine
if I just died on the road.

00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:00.400
But perhaps

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.199
fate was not done with me yet.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.920
So,

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:07.360
I stayed in Nanjiang

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.199
for many years.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.079
Deep in the Nanjiang mountains,

00:38:14.519 --> 00:38:17.320
miasma lingers all year round.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.239
That is how this illness
took root in me.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.840
It will never heal.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.880
I no longer remember which year it was,

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.360
when the Emperor
granted a general amnesty.

00:38:31.199 --> 00:38:33.400
Only then did I finally
return to Lin'an.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.920
Everything had changed.

00:39:28.519 --> 00:39:31.599
I myself had grown old and worn.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.320
With my heart reduced to ashes,

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:37.039
I only wished to see once more

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.159
the Guangling Residence
where I once lived.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.180
(Guangling Residence)

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.060
(Sun Zhixuan, Stepmadam of Guangling)

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.199
I already told you I do not want to go.

00:40:15.199 --> 00:40:17.920
Why must you force me
to meet that so called heir?
