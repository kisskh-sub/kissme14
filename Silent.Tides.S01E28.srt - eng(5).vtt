00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.990
[Episode 28]

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.810
Now the entire Macau

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.289
has been completely blockaded

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.560
by the Japanese.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.759
The fleet can't leave at all now.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.539
Besides, the shipment is enormous.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.450
Just unloading them

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.009
took 2 whole days.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.070
With so little time,

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.320
how could we possibly
transport everything?

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.650
Even if we could,

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.430
Macau is tiny.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.930
Is there a building or a street

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.290
that the Sawa Agency doesn't know?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.950
With such a massive shipment,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.290
where could we possibly hide it?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.410
What Xian means is that

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.960
everyone should immediately gather
all available manpower

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.340
and seize as much of the supplies
as possible.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.400
As for where to hide it,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.910
he's already working on a solution.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.170
What kind of solution?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.340
Xian said

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.840
that for now, the only option

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.130
is to take another risk
and use the blind spot

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.530
right under their noses.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.370
Xian?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.310
Why did you need to see me so urgently?

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.910
Hongshen,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.710
I don't have time to explain.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.150
I need to use the Lyun Coeng warehouse

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.030
you're in charge of.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.910
And this matter

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.840
must remain secret

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.040
from everyone in Lyun Coeng except you.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.530
Guys!

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.150
Move it!

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.870
-Move!
-Hurry up!

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.810
Be careful!

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.470
Let's go!

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.150
What's wrong?

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.930
Feeling guilty?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Chief,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.440
I've heard that Consul Imai
is a veteran spy.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.860
He's spent most of his life
working in China

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.750
and has headed
several intelligence agencies.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.970
With his experience,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.600
if he actually connects
with the Portuguese Macau government

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.660
and spots our flaw,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.030
we may lose control of the situation.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.900
Then let's just not let him connect

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.130
with the Portuguese Macau government.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.960
Not let him connect?

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.980
I know Imai well.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.370
He is an experienced spy
and a China expert.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.210
That's true.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.970
But aside from his seniority,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.160
he's actually foolish and timid,

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.940
a complete incompetent person.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.090
Otherwise,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.540
why would I recommend him
to serve as consul in Macau?

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.659
[Liu Jike's Egg Cake]

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.140
Mr. Imai,

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.580
are you aware
that the Portuguese Macau government

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.240
[Imai Keiichi,
the New Japanese Consul in Macau]

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.500
is the prime suspect
in the assassination of Consul Fukue?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.360
What?

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.660
The previous cargo ship attack
was carried out

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.570
by the Portuguese Macau government

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.030
in secret collusion
with the Allied Forces.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.990
Mr. Fukue was outraged

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.690
and intended to recommend to the Command

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.330
that Macau be occupied by force.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.810
However,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.740
we didn't expect
that just after he left the consulate,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.430
he would be killed by a masked assassin.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.830
So if this wasn't

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.960
the work
of the Portuguese Macau government,

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.340
who else could it have been?

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.160
I see.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.050
So that's why Mr. Fukue was assassinated.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.250
If you don't stay vigilant

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.690
and still dreaming about cooperating
with the Portuguese Macau government

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.090
to investigate the case,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.790
I'm afraid you will follow the same path
as Mr. Fukue.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.670
And if that happens,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.159
who will carry out the task

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.659
the Empire has entrusted to you?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.430
Well...

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.000
what should I do then?

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.710
Don't worry, Mr. Imai.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.860
I didn't spend these years in Macau

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.500
for nothing.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.770
I have already assembled an elite force

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.430
of hundreds of men.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.190
I will ensure your personal safety.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.520
That's good to hear.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.010
Then I'll be relying entirely on you,
Sawa.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.070
As long as you're willing to trust me,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.540
you can issue a written notice
to the Portuguese Macau government

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.470
that from now on,

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.980
my Sawa Agency, under your authority,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.570
will take full control
of the investigation.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.670
Leave

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.010
the rest to me.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.850
Are you truly willing to take on
such a heavy responsibility?

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.270
Mr. Fukue

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.130
was not only a colleague of mine
for many years,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.690
but also my closest friend.

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:47.520
And this matter

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.100
also concerns your life and safety.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.270
Once I have the authority
to handle the case,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.890
I will uncover the truth,
catch the real culprit,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.950
and bring the case to light
as quickly as possible.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.070
I promise you.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.240
Sawa,

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.130
I'm counting on you then.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.180

They're trying to seize these supplies.

What other choice do we have?

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.620
We can't let the Japanese get these goods.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.460
It's my warehouse. I can't leave anyway.

We'll save as much as we can.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.940

to our Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.900
Master Sanhe,

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.340
you have a plan?

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.320
Our fleet

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.620
has arrived at the port this afternoon.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.460
Outside,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.290
we have brothers keeping watch.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.580
So whatever we're doing in here,

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.320
that Huang Gongjie

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.750
has no idea.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.660
And he'd never expect

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.400
the goods would be transported
to the Japanese' own warehouse.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:31.870
So now,

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.640
as long as we sail out,

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.750
he'll definitely assume

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.950
the goods are on board

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.010
and then take the bait by chasing us.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.970
That way, you'll have more time

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.250
to move them.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.020
How can that work?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.130
The Japanese have sealed off

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.730
all the waters around Macau.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.360
If you sail out now,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.410
that's suicide.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.630
That's right, Master Sanhe.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.690
You can't sail out.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.630
Mr. He,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.300
usually you're the one in charge.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.650
This time,

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.870
let me decide.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.100
Brothers

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.960
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood!

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.580
Yes!

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.250
Since the founding

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.720
of our Tai Ho Brotherhood, in honor of

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.410
the spirit of the Song dynasty's
Prime Minister,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.030
General Wen,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.240
our ancestors

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.340
have laid down rules for us to follow:

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.740
every brother of the gang

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.290
must uphold loyalty and honor in jianghu.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.270
After all these years

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.450
of sailing the seas

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.700
and making our living in the underworld,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.870
brothers,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.390
please ask yourselves honestly:

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.510
have we truly

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.790
put loyalty and honor first?

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.640
I'm ashamed to say it,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.240
but we haven't.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.050
Including myself, as the Leader,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.500
sometimes

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.300
we've put profit above all else.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.420
That's why outsiders

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.620
see us as

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.550
disreputable pirates

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:17.870
and smugglers.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.290
To be honest,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.720
they're not entirely wrong.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.600
But in the past few years,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.040
when we set profit aside,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.400
stood up for our country and our people,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.410
and fought against the Japanese,

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.910
only then did we feel
we could finally straighten our backs

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.150
and stand as men with dignity.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.960
What man has ever lived that will not die?

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.780
Let my loyalty
shine in the pages of history.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.560
Everyone,

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.100
it's time to make a decision.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.280
Brothers!

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.640
What's your choice?

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.220
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.870
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.560
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.670
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.220
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.030
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.620
Mr. He,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.140
Mr. Ma,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.200
Luo,

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.760
you all heard that.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.880
Hurry up

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.240
and save the supplies.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.780
Just now,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.460
I deliberately

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.620
sent Zixia away.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.320
You should understand what I meant.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.550
Just one thing.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.720
Please tell him later

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.460
that no matter what happens

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.170
to us today,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.960
he must not act on impulse.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.540
As long as

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.530
he's alive,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.760
the Tai Ho Brotherhood
still has its roots.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.200
Please.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.370
Brothers of the Tai Ho Brotherhood!

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.950
Yes!

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.340
Follow me to the ship!

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.660
Aye-aye!

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.000
Let's go!

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.190
Open the gate!

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:36.870
Open the gate!

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.530
Open the gate!

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.270
Get out of the car!

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.320
-Move!
-Hurry!

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:39.940
-Keep up!
-Go!

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.100
-Hurry!
-Keep up!

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.320
-Hurry!
-Let's go.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.480
Keep up!

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.370
Hurry!

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.500
Hurry!

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.480
Didn't they say the Tai Ho Brotherhood

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.870
had the inner harbor
completely locked down?

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.800
Why isn't there a single soul here?

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.190
Turn on the navigation lights!

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.600
Raise the flag!

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.780
Weigh anchor!

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.000
Huang Sanhe?

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.200
Trying to run off with the goods?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.330
Let's see how far you can get this time.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.720
Sawa,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.200
why did you bring me to a hotel

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.660
instead of the consulate?

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.100
The consulate is a diplomatic institution
after all.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.010
Actually, on Portuguese turf,

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.810
there's no security guarantee.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.840
Otherwise,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.460
Mr. Fukue

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.750
wouldn't have been attacked
right at the entrance.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.940
East Asia Hotel is different.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.340
This is the base of
the Sawa Agency's Special Operations Team.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.480
As for security,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.980
you'll see for yourself soon.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.990
Mr. Imai.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.440
I had him

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.360
select dozens of elite subordinates

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.460
to ensure your safety.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.240
Mr. Imai,

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.980
are you satisfied with the arrangements?

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.610
I'm terribly sorry

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.790
for troubling you, Sawa.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.990
After what happened to Consul Fukue,

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:26.450
I can't afford

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.790
the slightest carelessness.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.000
Mr. Imai,

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.410
are the accommodations acceptable to you?

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.550
They're very good.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:41.460
Hello?

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.850
It's Captain Huang.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.080
Excuse me for a moment.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.110
It's me.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.460
What's the situation?

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.480
What did you say?

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.910
The Tai Ho Brotherhood's fleet
is escaping with the goods?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.410
An entire fleet.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.700
They've just left the harbor.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.880
They're trying
to break through our blockade

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.329
under cover of night with the goods.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.480
I'll lead the full team
in pursuit immediately.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.210
Understood.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.260
I'll contact the navy at once

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.390
to seal off the area.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.550
Attack them from both front and rear.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.369
Don't let a single ship escape.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.310
Yes.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:19.579
Let's go.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.569
Sawa.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.030
Wasn't Captain Huang supposed to be

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.090
investigating the vehicle
involved in the Fukue case?

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.040
Why is he suddenly chasing a fleet?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160
Here's the thing.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.530
Before you arrived,

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.350
we obtained an important lead.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.700
An important lead?

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.160
Yes.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.200
Behind Mr. Fukue's assassination

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.010
lies a case

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.700
of major strategic supplies smuggling
in Macau.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.300
That's why Captain Huang
went to investigate both cases at once.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.520
Then why didn't you
mention this to me earlier?

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.410
At the time,

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.010
the lead was still being verified,

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.830
so I didn't report it hastily.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.940
Mr. Imai,

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.850
I need to contact the navy now.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.610
I'll brief you

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.270
on the details shortly.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.380
There they are!

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.180
Leader, there's a Japanese warship ahead

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.180
blocking our way!

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.550
Leader,

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.440
a ship is following

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.370
right behind us.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.610
I've been sailing in Lingding Channel

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.900
fighting winds and waves for 50 years.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.220
It won't be that easy to stop me.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.080
Change course!

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.030
The longer we delay them, the better!

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.030
Let's keep running them in circles!

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.530
Uncle,
I've brought back the empty vehicle.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.920
Xian, where are the Leader and others?

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.040
Fire!

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.620
Fire!

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.250
Move forward!

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:47.890
Fire!

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.560
Fire!

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.050
Attack!

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.270
Mr. Imai,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.410
that's roughly the situation.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.290
Once we seize this crucial batch
of strategic materials,

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.070
the credit

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.850
will be 10 times
that of solving Mr. Fukue's case.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.460
Then, with both charges combined,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.160
the Imperial Army will have
legitimate grounds to occupy Macau.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:23.290
I will make sure you're credited
as the top contributor.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.500
Whether to send troops to occupy Macau

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.200
is not for you or me to decide.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.310
Sawa,

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.460
I have only one requirement.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.460
From now on, any intelligence

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.540
or action concerning Macau

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.140
must be reported to me first.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.640
Yes.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.690

Chairman, what's wrong?

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.240
All ships of the Tai Ho Brotherhood

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.090
have been intercepted and destroyed
by the Japanese Army.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.130
The
Sawa Agency's Special Operations Team's

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.180

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.090
and will reach the harbor shortly.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.590
So they've realized they were fooled.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.920
Mr. He and the others

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.220
are unloading goods
at the Lyun Coeng warehouse.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.850
The intelligence agents
will head straight here very soon.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.240
Leave now.
After you're out of the warehouse,

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.160
make sure to erase the tire tracks

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.740
at the intersection
leading to the Lyun Coeng warehouse.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.200
Tell them
not to send any more vehicles here.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.770
But there are traces everywhere,

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.830
inside and outside the warehouse.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.110
There's no time to clean them all up.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.740
Once the intelligence agents arrive,

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.500
they'll still figure out
where the goods went.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.460
Don't worry about here.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.980
I'll take care of it.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.940
Chairman, how can you handle it alone?

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.960
Besides, the intelligence agents
will be here soon.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.660
I've already called the police.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.940
Inspector General Gonçalves
is on his way here with officers.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.090

The intelligence agents are coming.

The Chairman sent us here

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.310
to stop all empty trucks
that have finished unloading.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.840
We're not allowed
to return to the warehouse.

I should have personally served you tea,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.850
but there's no tea here.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.300
So please forgive me

It's gasoline.

the Imperial Army
has law enforcement authority in Macau.

There are no Portuguese or Chinese here.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.920
There is only Rodrigues from Macau.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.030
And the people of Macau
have only one belief:

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.550

Won't everything be exposed?

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.050
It can't be hidden anyway.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.150
We might as well make it public.

The bigger the mess, the better.

Make it so big that Imai can't contain it.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.170

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.780
what's happening outside?

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.670
Why are there suddenly
so many troops and police?

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.880
Mr. Imai, something big has happened.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.630
The Portuguese Macau government

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.400
is going to openly use force against you.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.230
Use force?

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:13.780
Yes.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.640
Against me?

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.590
Huang Gongjie has led his men

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.380
into the East Asia Hotel.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.030
The garrison and police
have surrounded the hotel

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:33.420
to prevent their escape.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.280
Prevent their escape? At a time like this?

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.530
Why not attack directly?

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:39.400
Why?

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.760
Exactly.
They even dared to kill Rodrigues.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.500
What are we waiting for?

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.260
Let's storm in and avenge Rodrigues!

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.920
Everyone, please stay calm.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.730
We cannot start a fight.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.860
The Special Operations Team
has not only taken

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.800
all the hotel guests hostage,

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.920
but more importantly,

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.550
Imai and Sawa Eisaku
are also inside the hotel.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.090
So we can't touch them
because the Japanese are involved?

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.070
Huang Gongjie is nothing
but the Japanese's lackey.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.090
Rodrigues's blood debt

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.440
should be on the Japanese!

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.650
Why show him any restraint?

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:08.510
The Special Operations Team is certainly
acting under Sawa Eisaku's orders.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.570
But the Japanese consul is inside.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.550
Once fighting starts,

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.320
they'll claim that Macau struck first.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.590
The Japanese
already have troops at our borders.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.520
They will seize the chance
to occupy Macau.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.650
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:18.800
including you,

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.480
all of our families are still in Macau.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.340
Even if we don't think of Macau,

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.820
we have to think of our own safety
and that of our families.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.550
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.150
Inspector General Gonçalves is right.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.190
We must remain calm now

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:32.820
and not fire the first shot.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.510
You Portuguese cowards,

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.340
trying to be spineless again, huh?

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.440
Brothers, let's go ourselves!

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.130
Stop!

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.840
Hurry! Stop them!

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.770
Get out of my way!

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.380
What are you doing?

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.610
Keep being cowards!

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.780
Why are you stopping us?

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:47.260
I'm telling you,

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.060
my bullets don't discriminate.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.980
Zixia!

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.800
Master Huang!

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.340
What are you doing?

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.110
What am I doing?

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.110
Huang Gongjie is right in there.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.440
Uncle and our fallen brothers

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.130
are all waiting for me to avenge them!

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.150
Huang Gongjie's Special Operations Team
numbers two or three hundred.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.880
Aren't you going to your death?

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.410
Once I pull this trigger,

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.000
it's on.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.690
These cowards will have to get involved
whether they want to or not!

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:09.720
Fine, even if they

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:10.880
keep standing aside,

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.310
the Tai Ho Brotherhood has thousands

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.550
of brothers across all branches.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.560
I'll call them all here!

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.090
Let's see how he dies today!

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:17.530
Zixia!

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.600
You know better than anyone

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.830
what Master Sanhe and the others

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.290
died for.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.440
If you pull the trigger today,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.480
you'll give the Japanese an excuse
to deploy troops to Macau.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.300
Then what about those supplies?

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.810
What about all of Macau?

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.570
Wouldn't Master Sanhe
and the others die in vain?

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.000
I understand how you feel.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.230
We all want revenge for Master Sanhe.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:54.070
Huang Gongjie will definitely be punished,

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.320
but not today.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.130
Rodrigues?

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.460
The son of the former governor of Macau

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.670
and the biggest Portuguese merchant
in Macau?

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:16.530
They even dared to kill such a

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.210
prominent figure from a neutral country?

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:18.870
Has your Special Operations Team gone mad?

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:20.170
[Loyalty, Strength, Success, Morals]

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:21.360
I told you,

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.210
Rodrigues obstructed
the investigation first.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:27.170
The Special Operations Team
only fired warning shots

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.380
and accidentally caused harm.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:30.400
But again,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.230
Rodrigues
colluded with anti-Japanese elements

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.650
to smuggle strategic supplies
for the Chinese Army

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.850
and the Anglo-American Allied Forces.

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.090
He deserved to die anyway.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.970
And the Portuguese Macau government,

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.680
knowing he was the main culprit
in the major smuggling case,

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.880
still surrounded the Japanese Consul.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.210
Do you know what that means?

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.880
It's a declaration of war
against the Empire of Japan.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.900
No.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.590
The situation isn't clear yet.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:58.480
[Loyalty, Strength, Success, Morals]

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.350
We can't jump to that conclusion.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.970
The Portuguese troops and police
have already surrounded the hotel.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.780
This is clearly an act of war.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.120
Even for your personal safety,

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.880
you should report to the Command

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.670
and demand

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.170
the Imperial Army
land in Macau immediately

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.230
to suppress the
Portuguese Macau government by force.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.090
But the Portuguese haven't fired yet,
have they?

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.090
That means

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:24.090
they don't want to start a fight.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.150
Mr. Imai,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.090
the whereabouts of those
strategic supplies are still unknown.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.010
They were clearly hidden
by those anti-Japanese elements.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.570
Once the Imperial Army applies pressure

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.030
and finds them,

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.580
occupying Macau will be fully justified.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.920
And for you,

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:40.000
it will be a major achievement.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.570
And what if we don't find them?

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.530
Wouldn't that mean
I deceived my superiors?

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.000
Then the responsibility would fall on me.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.420
We will

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:54.430
definitely find them.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.920
Colonel Sawa,

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.630
you keep saying
you're helping me investigate the case,

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.480
yet your focus has been entirely

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.480
on some so-called strategic supplies
no one has seen.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.010
Now the supplies haven't been found,

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.670
Rodrigues has been killed,

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.190
and things have escalated into

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.320
an armed standoff between both sides.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.370
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.710
I'm only trying to uncover the truth

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.060
behind Fukue's case

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.560
and eliminate

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.050
the anti-Japanese forces
in Macau for the Command.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.360
Say no more.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:28.670
My mission from the Command

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.500
is to uncover the truth of Fukue's murder,

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.830
apprehend the culprit,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.630
and seek an apology and compensation
from the Portuguese Macau government,

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.230
not to provoke a war.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.170
The Imperial Army's
current military strength

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.850
does not allow for reckless escalation.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.770
You two, stay outside and keep watch.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:48.840
If anyone fires on the Macao–Portuguese
troops or police on their own initiative

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.340
and attempts
to trigger a military conflict,

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.800
report to me immediately!

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:52.730
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.240
Colonel Sawa,

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.150
what I need now is direct negotiations

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:04.690
with the Portuguese Macau government.
