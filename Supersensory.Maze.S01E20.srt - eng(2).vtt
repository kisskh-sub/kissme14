00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.040
The stuff is off the clock.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.590
Why are you still inside?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.480
The game isn't over yet.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.000
Whoever you care about

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.200
ends up dead.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.680
Liu Ming proved that.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.560
The passenger is on board.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.520
Captain He!

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.680
Captain He!

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.240
Captain He!

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.750
Captain He, look!

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.020
Notify the bomb squad.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.310
Yes.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.870
Director Feng.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.910
Bomb squad,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.840
CIU requests backup.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.840
I don't believe

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.870
there's a real bomb.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.590
Kill me, and the timer stops.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.470
He Ya lives.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.920
Move!

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.340
Bomb!

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.710
- Run!
- Stop looking!

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.840
- Run!
- Move!

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.960
Fall back!

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.030
Captain He!

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.960
Fall back!

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.200
Captain He!

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.400
Captain He, get down!

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.310
I'll go!

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.400
Get down! It's dangerous!

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.400
Captain He!

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.680
Captain He!

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.080
Before I detonate,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.910
you still have a chance.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.710
What chance is that?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.120
You should've put me

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.520
in that truck.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.160
Lu Ran, I know

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.000
you're out of cards.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.110
Yuan,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.310
don't you want to say hi

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.480
to Ya?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.840
Xu Jingzhi?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.840
Xu Jingzhi?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.200
I'm here.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.310
I almost forgot.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.270
He Ya is

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.680
the passenger inside.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.510
She's on a fuel tanker

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.390
parked in Lujia Village.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.870
I'm going

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.710
to blow it.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.880
Xu Jingzhi,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.630
do what you should do.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.800
Trust me.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.920
You have to trust me, too.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.960
Shut up!

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.950
Who are you to order him?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.240
You're just a puppet!

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.320
Hello?

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.520
Hello?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.430
I only want to know

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.920
what you truly want to do.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.760
Lu Ran,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.870
none of them understands what you and I

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.070
have lived through.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.470
No one.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.070
What do you think I should do?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.710
Kill me,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.310
and the passenger survives.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.270
You want me to kill you?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.270
Inside that container,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.190
you had the chance

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.390
to refuse being saved by me.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.560
Why wait until today?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.060
(Lujia Village)

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.560
Captain He,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.120
this is Badge No. 016290,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.970
here to help.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.000
The road ahead is cleared.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.320
Copy that.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.070
You still don't get it?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.800
He Ya's about to die.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.510
You might never even find

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.390
her bones.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.360
Don't you hate me?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.920
Don't you want to shoot me dead?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.120
Before I hate you,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.750
I'm still your brother.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.950
Can hatred solve your problems?

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.600
Why not?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.160
Zhang Yutong,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.800
Liu Wanyao, Shi Zelin.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.000
All of them grew brave

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.190
because of hate!

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.600
I killed Zheng Xintao

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.390
to protect the other girls.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.630
Back then,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.630
why didn't anyone protect me?

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.040
I'll agree

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.310
to all your terms,

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.070
as long as you help me

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.830
kill them.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.920
Have you thought it through?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.120
If Wu Xinxin were alive,

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.150
she wouldn't want you

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.840
to become what you are now.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.200
It's not just for her.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.270
I'm avenging myself as well.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.440
Has hatred made you braver?

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.600
Has it lifted

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.440
the weight of pain?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.800
Lu Ran,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.150
will blowing Lujia Village flat

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.550
repay your childhood?

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.080
There's a construction site 500 m ahead.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.600
Captain He,
turn right into the open ground.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.840
Too close to living quarters.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.720
I need somewhere safer.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.360
Captain He, you're out of time.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.200
It's too dangerous.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.550
I'll head for the expressway.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.570
Zhangyang Expressway
has a dead-end spur.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.150
Hello, this is Command Center.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.200
This is Command Center.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.200
What's going on?

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.670
Okay.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.750
Command Center,

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.750
no explosives were found

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.420
(Big-Data Platform)
in Wuyang University.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.260
The threat is lifted.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.150
Command Center,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.630
no explosives were found

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.580
in Xinyuan Trade Center.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.510
The threat is lifted.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.550
Command Center,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.870
no explosives were found

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.990
on the river-crossing bridge.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.110
The threat is lifted.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.390
Director Feng,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.820
there's only the fuel tanker.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.420
(Video link)
Captain He is driving it

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.140
to the Zhangyang Expressway, 2 km away.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.550
Traffic and fire units

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.510
are setting

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.600
a cordon at the dead end.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.510
Okay. Got it.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.150
Any word from Xu Jingzhi?

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.840
No signal yet.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.120
His locator's gone dark.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.510
Badge No. 016290,

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.850
slow down and widen the distance.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.790
Captain He, jump out!

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.390
Fire crews will take over.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.550
Time's almost up.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.790
Execute the order!

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.910
You still can't

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.360
understand how I feel.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.600
It was you,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.440
like a beam of light,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.080
who led me out

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.630
of the gloomy Lu Village.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.600
It was you who gave me

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.870
the strength to strike back.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.030
In a life that should've been neglected,

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.270
there was suddenly hope.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.790
While you were teaching me

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.720
how to stay calm and act rationally,

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.320
here I am.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.000
Why am I still alive?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.630
Why was I ever born?

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.000
All these years I've grown up,

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.790
who ever taught me?

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.000
Who ever taught me

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.840
about love and dignity?

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.120
My parents?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.910
Or you who abandoned

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.480
and deceived me

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.600
for your own sake?

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.600
Wu Min once loved you.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.550
I taught you.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.870
He Ya taught you, too.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.870
You chose the wrong path.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.030
Lu Ran, hate me.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.960
I don't hate you.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.750
30 seconds!

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.660
(Lu Ran)

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.940
(Lu Ran)

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.480
Xu Jingzhi!

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.840
You have to believe me.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.440
This is exactly right.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.870
Better your hatred

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.080
than your indifference.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.080
Only this way

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.600
can you feel what I feel.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.240
Come on.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.630
Come on!

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.160
Lu Ran.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.990
Lu Ran!

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.590
Lu Ran.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.000
We're both trapped by the past.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.910
Only now do I see

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.320
you've been waiting for me.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.720
But you've already gone

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.870
too far wrong.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.440
Putting on the cuffs

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.120
is the only thing I can still teach you.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.600
I'm a lousy man.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840
Forgive me, okay?

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.550
Let's go up.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.000
Come on.

(Sealed by Wuyang Police)

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.270
The police have recently confirmed

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.270
that Mai Boyuan,
Longyuan Group chairman,

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.550
is suspected of financial fraud,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.960
embezzlement of corporate assets,
human trafficking,

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.160
and multiple other crimes.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.440
Mai Boyuan

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.830
and related personnel

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.680
have been under investigation.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.830
Up to the time of broadcast,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.240
15 suspects have been arrested,

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.310
7 of whom

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.030
are Longyuan Group employees.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.270
(Mai Boyuan is arrested)
The other eight are unemployed.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.550
The case is still under trial.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.640
Isn't that Jiao Yu?

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.920
The police have opened a hotline

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.160
How did he end up like this?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.310
and an e-mail address.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.510
The public may contact

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.070
the police to provide clues.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.550
This program will

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.310
keep following the developments.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.870
Yu,

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.110
the hospital has found

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:45.310
a matching kidney.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.640
Tingting's transplant surgery

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.510
went smoothly.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.310
There's no rejection so far.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.000
Don't worry.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.920
When she's discharged,

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.070
we'll come see you.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.430
Feifei,

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.960
this is what Shi Zelin left for you.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.400
Zelin?

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.340
(Current Deposit)

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.550
Look.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.030
This is me with Zelin.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.240
Here's my number.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.440
If anything happens to her,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.300
call me.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.160
Okay.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.760
Ma'am,

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.200
I haven't found Zelin.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.640
Could you

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.750
give this to him first?

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.150
Sure.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.670
Thanks.

- Thanks, Yin.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.110
- Don't eat them all.
- Okay.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.300

Don't worry, Yin.

into my line of sight.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.590
I had to act.

would give

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.640
a monologue like this?

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:07.920

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.310
a serial murderer.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.830
But Mr. Xu's answer

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.160
is never that simple.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.160
Can any of you

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.920
give a less simple answer?

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.430
Mr. Xu,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.960
besides a psychopathic murderer,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.070
this monologue

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.680
could also come

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.680
from a battle-hardened soldier.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.510
A sniper?

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.680
Or even

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.950
an SWAT officer?

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:40.870
Where do you live?

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.590
I live in the plant dorm.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.480
Where were you yesterday?

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.750
I was off yesterday.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.230
Okay, and you?

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:50.480
My name is Liu Bo.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.360
Don't run.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.310
- Don't move.
- What?

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.200
- What?
- Don't move.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.040
Stay put.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.350
Alright.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.830
Today's drill is over.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.240

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.790

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.320

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.270
the body's here.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.310
How can you be sure

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.960
this is the primary crime scene?

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.750
How did you deduce

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:36.790
from footprints alone

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.110
that the murderer isn't local?

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.070
And how did you and Captain He know

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.270
the murderer was on site?

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.880
The top of the written exam, right?

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.000
How did you know?

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.270
What did I

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.110
give away?

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.540
Where's the voice recorder?

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.510
What do you want to know?

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:12.870
Let's go for a walk.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.480
From now on, you'll meet

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.550
plenty of oddballs

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.640
with unique skills.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.240
Get used to it.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.110
We don't label them psychos

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.920
in a bad way.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.240
Why?

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.070
Because they benefit society,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.270
not harm it.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.590
That's a sociological

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.440
and utilitarian view.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.680
It's not psychology.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.920
They aren't born this way,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.590
nor shaped by environment,

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.550
but by job demand.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.030
So, they stay rational.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.070
It's because of faith.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.880
No rule is

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.440
flawless enough

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.030
to deliver absolute justice.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.110
Ordinary people can look away

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.350
and retreat,

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:19.720
but we

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.070
can't stop chasing

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.240
that absoluteness,

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.790
because the rule of law is

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.350
our society's bottom line.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.200
We often hear:

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.480
Who fights dragons

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.640
becomes a dragon.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.070
To me,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.920
the line between justice and evil

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.680
is faith,

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.720
not ability,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.590
not whether you fit

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.070
normal standards.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:52.720
Trust your beliefs.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:54.590
You must forge yourselves

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.790
from ordinary people

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.830
into ones who exceed

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.110
normal psychology.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.350
Overcome fear,

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.070
overcome rage,

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.440
and endure pain

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.440
to be fit for this job.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.060
(Tomb of Lu Ran)

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:29.860
(Erected by elder brother Xu Jingzhi)

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.580
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.340
(Tomb of Lu Ran)

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.630
Hurry over!

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.110
Come here!

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.880
Uncle, you don't fit in.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.030
I can tell you don't either.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.280
I'm just too excellent.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.320
What is excellence?

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.070
Loneliness.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.110
Not all excellent people

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.550
are lonely.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.440
You have

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.920
many better choices.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.920
Sit down where you are.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.440
Wei Zixuan!

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.460
Okay? Here.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.200
You can toss it.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.440
Wei Zixuan,

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.400
classmates and teachers
are looking for you.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.280
Let's go.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.280
We've got a new game.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.800
Who told you to find me?

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.350
Uncle,

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.840
let me think.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.400
Go find a spot and toss first.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.790
