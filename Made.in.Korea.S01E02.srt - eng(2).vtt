00:00:07.112 --> 00:00:09.197
The collapse
of the Mapo Citizens' Apartment

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:11.199
already notorious for shoddy construction…

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:13.827
Would you look at that?
The world has gone crazy.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.954
It's not long
before everything goes to hell.

00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:18.248
Well, I guess it had a good run.

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:22.085
One day, the whole world will come
crashing down like that apartment.

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.421
Will you stop with the doom
and gloom already?

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:27.716
What about our Huijeong?
Want her to die before she even blooms?

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:30.969
I'm just saying. The world is
not going to fold that easily.

00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:32.346
The doenjang stew is good.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:34.264
I'm scared the baby might hear you.

00:00:35.098 --> 00:00:38.602
With its so-called dad
spouting that kind of talk,

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:40.687
you think it'd even want to be born?

00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:43.106
Geez. I'm sorry, okay? Let's just eat.

00:00:48.153 --> 00:00:49.237
Who's that?

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.241
Damn, who is it?

00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:55.410
Mr. Kim, it…
It's Robert.

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:02.000
Are you nuts?

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:04.461
I told you not to come to my house.

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:07.547
Mr. Kim, we're going back
to the States next week.

00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:10.175
For old times' sake,
let me have it just this once.

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:11.510
I'll pay you double.

00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:13.887
Double?

00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:16.515
Damn it.

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:19.309
Come on.

00:01:22.938 --> 00:01:25.816
Have you lost it?
What were you thinking calling them here?

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:29.111
I didn't. They showed up on their own.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.410
Hello?

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.708
BEOMCHEON-DONG, CAFÉ C'EST…

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.003
Got it. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.552
They said they'll pay double.

00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:56.221
Let's just give it
and send them away. Go get it.

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:01.101
Hurry, go grab it.

00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:31.715
What? Have you lost your mind?

00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:34.509
What the hell are you doing?

00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:26.913
Huh? Mr. Jang.

00:04:27.998 --> 00:04:28.999
Be careful.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.269
Evening, sir.

00:04:52.314 --> 00:04:53.690
The victims were married.

00:04:53.773 --> 00:04:57.527
Kim Taeyeong, 29 years old,
and his wife, Lee Suni, 26.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.155
They had a three-year-old daughter, and…

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.242
the wife was pregnant.

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:07.329
Oh, and this.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.760
The US Army already took them
into custody and got their confessions.

00:05:23.803 --> 00:05:24.930
First,

00:05:26.598 --> 00:05:28.058
let's get the kid out of here.

00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:31.269
She doesn't really have
anywhere else to go.

00:05:32.687 --> 00:05:34.773
Her uncle's on his way now.

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:39.069
Is it because of the rain?

00:05:39.152 --> 00:05:41.529
The whole place reeks of blood.

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:03.343
BEOMCHEON-DONG,
CAFÉ C'EST LA VIE, 6 P.M., 1 KG

00:06:07.847 --> 00:06:09.891
This child's parents were drug dealers.

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:16.314
Middlemen who got meth from suppliers
and sold it on to end consumers.

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:20.068
The couple seemed as ordinary as anyone,

00:06:20.652 --> 00:06:23.571
but they were murdered
by US soldiers while dealing drugs.

00:06:26.533 --> 00:06:29.119
Those US soldiers were addicted to meth.

00:06:30.412 --> 00:06:32.956
They never had the money
to buy it in the first place.

00:06:34.124 --> 00:06:35.959
With no money, they had to steal.

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:38.461
Once you're hooked on meth…

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:40.213
-Move, please!
-…nothing else matters.

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:41.339
This way, sir.

00:06:42.007 --> 00:06:44.926
I bet that's what happened
when they killed this girl's parents.

00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:50.598
They decided their own craving
mattered more than someone else's life.

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:56.312
This girl's name is Kim Huijeong.

00:06:57.522 --> 00:06:59.315
Now that her parents are dead,

00:06:59.816 --> 00:07:02.986
the bottle in her mouth
is all she has to survive on.

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:06.865
When she grows up,
will she remember this moment?

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.618
People say time heals all wounds.

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:13.955
That everything gets better with time.

00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:18.251
But this girl will remember this
for the rest of her life.

00:07:19.836 --> 00:07:22.088
Her own face as she sucked on the bottle,

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:25.925
her parents' faces as their throats
were cut over a drug deal,

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:28.845
and the stench of blood
that filled the room.

00:07:31.473 --> 00:07:33.224
If there really is a God,

00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:36.060
may he save this girl's soul

00:07:37.353 --> 00:07:39.731
from the power of the dog.

00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:47.507
Ah, ah.

00:09:04.107 --> 00:09:06.025
Good afternoon, sir.

00:09:06.109 --> 00:09:07.110
What's that?

00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:10.029
Well, I went home
to grab some files I'd forgotten.

00:09:10.113 --> 00:09:11.781
- On your bike?
- Yes.

00:09:12.907 --> 00:09:14.450
Did you guys eat yet?

00:09:14.534 --> 00:09:15.535
Yes.

00:09:15.618 --> 00:09:17.036
Sure did.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.497
Can you order me
a jjajangmyeon? Make it extra-large.

00:09:19.581 --> 00:09:22.834
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, Jang!

00:09:24.377 --> 00:09:25.503
Listen.

00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:28.381
You said you weren't
taking public security cases.

00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:31.176
That's right.

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:33.761
Then focus on narcotics.

00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:37.056
Why are you poking around
in a public security case?

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.769
It's connected to the victims
in my case, so I looked into it.

00:09:42.979 --> 00:09:46.107
Being a KCIA informant doesn't mean
you can't be a junkie too, right?

00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:47.192
Jang.

00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:49.903
When I first met you at the Seoul Office,

00:09:49.986 --> 00:09:53.448
I was a section chief, and you were
just a prosecutor with no title, right?

00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:56.242
And when I was in Gwangju
as a departmental chief,

00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:58.578
you still had no title.

00:09:58.661 --> 00:10:02.540
And now, I've been sent here
to Busan as the deputy chief prosecutor.

00:10:02.624 --> 00:10:05.835
But you? You're still without a title.

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:10.048
All your peers are section chiefs now,
some moving up to departmental chiefs.

00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:14.344
How long will you keep drifting
around the country without a title?

00:10:15.178 --> 00:10:19.182
Well, all I can do is give it my best.

00:10:19.265 --> 00:10:22.227
That's exactly why
you never get promoted. You're too rigid.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.103
No flexibility!

00:10:24.812 --> 00:10:27.774
Learn to work the hierarchy.

00:10:27.857 --> 00:10:30.360
What do you think an organization is, huh?

00:10:31.945 --> 00:10:35.365
An organization is a place where you work.

00:10:35.448 --> 00:10:38.284
I still have work to do,
so I'd better get to it now.

00:10:39.369 --> 00:10:41.496
Jang. Don't mess with the KCIA, all right?

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:44.499
Cross them and we're
the only ones who bleed.

00:10:44.582 --> 00:10:48.211
Okay. I'll keep that
in mind and do my best, sir.

00:10:48.795 --> 00:10:51.464
We certainly can't have
bloodshed on the job.

00:10:51.547 --> 00:10:53.007
You're impossible.

00:10:53.675 --> 00:10:56.052
Open a window in here, will you?
It smells like…

00:10:57.262 --> 00:10:59.681
And turn the lights on!
It's so dark in here.

00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:01.474
-Yes, sir.
-What is this, a rat's nest?

00:11:01.557 --> 00:11:03.017
Geez.

00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:04.644
Well, I'm off!

00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:07.855
Good day, sir!

00:11:08.898 --> 00:11:10.441
Turn them off.

00:11:11.484 --> 00:11:12.485
The lights.

00:11:14.737 --> 00:11:16.155
Goodness.

00:11:18.574 --> 00:11:20.785
It's nice and gloomy, isn't it?

00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:29.627
- You order my jjajangmyeon yet?
- Yes, sir.

00:11:35.216 --> 00:11:38.011
DIRECTOR GENERAL HWANG GUKPYEONG

00:11:39.762 --> 00:11:42.265
Director General Hwang Gukpyeong,
my direct superior.

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:44.892
In charge of the entire
Busan branch of the KCIA.

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:45.977
It got on me.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.104
One word from him,
and the whole city moves.

00:11:48.187 --> 00:11:50.773
Anyway,

00:11:52.692 --> 00:11:53.985
about Jo Manjae.

00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:59.073
I hear he's been
dealing meth with the Yakuza.

00:11:59.157 --> 00:12:00.158
Yes, I'm aware.

00:12:05.872 --> 00:12:07.081
You're aware?

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:09.167
Yes, sir.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.093
That meth is what I loaded
onto the plane and sent off to Pyongyang.

00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:20.345
The Manjae Gang's meth.

00:12:43.493 --> 00:12:46.162
The Manjae Gang,
Busan's biggest crime syndicate.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.165
KANG DAEIL,
THE MANJAE GANG UNDERBOSS

00:12:49.248 --> 00:12:51.000
JO MANJAE,
THE MANJAE GANG BOSS

00:12:51.084 --> 00:12:54.670
Under Director Hwang's protection,
they grew fast.

00:12:54.754 --> 00:12:58.091
They kick back 30%
of their monthly take to him,

00:12:58.174 --> 00:13:00.301
straight into the KCIA's pocket.

00:13:02.303 --> 00:13:04.555
The gang pulls every crime in the book

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.849
and rakes in a million dollars
from the underworld.

00:13:06.933 --> 00:13:10.186
At this point, you could say
they practically run the Busan economy.

00:13:20.947 --> 00:13:24.951
THE POWER OF THE DOG

00:13:25.535 --> 00:13:28.996
I was planning to take care of it myself.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.291
Jang Geonyoung, a prosecutor
at the Busan District Prosecutors' Office,

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:35.545
is apparently gunning for Jo Manjae,
all fired up.

00:13:35.628 --> 00:13:38.881
They say he's a Marine legend
who once took down armed guerrillas

00:13:38.965 --> 00:13:42.844
with his bare hands and got
a Hwarang Order of Military Merit for it.

00:13:42.927 --> 00:13:48.641
And he's the kind of loose cannon
who doesn't give a damn about higher-ups.

00:13:49.809 --> 00:13:52.562
So how do you plan on
handling him, Mr. Baek?

00:13:53.938 --> 00:13:55.356
Don't worry, sir.

00:13:55.439 --> 00:13:57.400
I'll take care of him myself.

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:21.007
Why don't you guys go out for a smoke?

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:25.011
Sit.

00:14:28.598 --> 00:14:31.058
- Everything good while I was away?
- Yes, sir. All good.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.104
Listen, look into
Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung

00:14:35.188 --> 00:14:37.648
at the Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

00:14:37.732 --> 00:14:40.985
His background, family,
relatives, friends, personality…

00:14:41.068 --> 00:14:44.238
Well, whatever it is,
don't miss a single detail.

00:14:44.864 --> 00:14:47.575
Dig up every last thing
connected to him and bring it to me.

00:14:48.075 --> 00:14:49.076
Yes, sir.

00:14:58.127 --> 00:15:01.130
Ah. Nice to meet you. John Evans.

00:15:01.214 --> 00:15:02.298
Just call me John.

00:15:03.299 --> 00:15:04.634
Okay, John.

00:15:06.219 --> 00:15:08.429
What are those bastards doing here?

00:15:09.013 --> 00:15:10.806
Exercise. One hour per day.

00:15:11.974 --> 00:15:15.144
The murderers have rights too? Hmm?

00:15:15.228 --> 00:15:16.520
Don't they in Korea?

00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:23.110
Let's get done with this quickly.

00:15:23.194 --> 00:15:26.697
We've already provided enough information
with the police regarding their cases.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.116
That's different, man.

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:31.327
Look.

00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:32.995
Hmm?

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.999
In the corner. Here.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.834
Something's written.

00:15:39.627 --> 00:15:41.712
Remember the man you killed?

00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:45.967
He wrote it down when he was in the phone…

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.301
No. On the phone.

00:15:48.135 --> 00:15:49.136
Hmm?

00:15:49.637 --> 00:15:52.723
Any phone call when you were in the house?

00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:58.062
Uh… Mr. Kim picked up the phone
and wrote something down on the paper.

00:15:58.562 --> 00:15:59.563
Okay.

00:16:01.607 --> 00:16:02.608
But…

00:16:03.734 --> 00:16:04.777
if you look at it,

00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:06.779
there's no date.

00:16:07.863 --> 00:16:10.783
Only the time and place.

00:16:10.866 --> 00:16:13.202
It's a deal. A drug deal.

00:16:13.828 --> 00:16:15.788
Is there anything you heard about it?

00:16:15.871 --> 00:16:17.498
These guys cannot understand Korean.

00:16:17.581 --> 00:16:20.418
Even if they heard something,
they wouldn't know what it meant.

00:16:23.087 --> 00:16:26.257
Yeah, I know.
But I wanted to ask, just in case.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.635
They should know a few words in Korean,
now that they're in Korea.

00:16:29.719 --> 00:16:31.929
- So damn disrespectful.
- What?

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:34.432
Okay.

00:16:34.515 --> 00:16:38.853
Now, you listen carefully. Hmm?

00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:40.229
To what I say.

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:46.027
"If you cooperate with me,

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.155
I may be able to cut down your sentence.

00:16:49.238 --> 00:16:53.326
Then you can be sent back
to your country in a few years,

00:16:53.409 --> 00:16:58.372
or I could even let you serve
your sentence in the States."

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.041
Understand?

00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:01.542
It's a deal!

00:17:02.084 --> 00:17:03.544
It's a deal!

00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:05.254
"See you tomorrow."

00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:13.346
Mr. Kim said, "See you tomorrow."

00:17:13.929 --> 00:17:14.930
You speak Korean?

00:17:15.014 --> 00:17:16.432
My girlfriend's Korean.

00:17:20.061 --> 00:17:21.145
Tomorrow?

00:17:21.729 --> 00:17:22.730
You sure?

00:17:23.773 --> 00:17:26.275
- Tomorrow.
- I'm sure.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.361
Good job.

00:17:32.073 --> 00:17:33.074
Oh, right.

00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:35.368
By the way…

00:17:36.952 --> 00:17:39.288
The woman you killed, Lee Suni.

00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:44.669
She was pregnant.

00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:56.389
We've received intel

00:17:56.472 --> 00:17:58.557
that the meth dealers murdered last night,

00:17:58.641 --> 00:18:01.519
Kim Taeyeong and his wife, Lee Suni,

00:18:01.602 --> 00:18:07.191
had a deal lined up
with their supplier today at 6:00 p.m.

00:18:07.274 --> 00:18:10.319
at the Café C'est La Vie
in Beomcheon-dong.

00:18:10.403 --> 00:18:15.574
Assuming the supplier doesn't know
they're dead yet, he's expected to show.

00:18:15.658 --> 00:18:18.828
Two of our investigators
will pose as the couple on site

00:18:18.911 --> 00:18:21.455
and the moment he shows up,
we move in for the arrest.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.043
Hello, I'm here.

00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:28.212
Ah, Ms. Oh!

00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:31.465
Sir, this is Ms. Oh.
She'll be playing the wife.

00:18:34.093 --> 00:18:35.511
Hello, sir.

00:18:36.137 --> 00:18:38.973
I'm Oh Yejin.
I've just been assigned to the team.

00:18:39.056 --> 00:18:41.517
I'll be playing the wife, Lee Suni,
in today's operation.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.728
Right. Welcome aboard, Investigator Oh.

00:18:45.187 --> 00:18:47.857
So… What about the husband?

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.941
Right.

00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:52.862
That's me.

00:18:56.866 --> 00:18:58.826
We'll need to find you
a different husband.

00:18:58.909 --> 00:19:00.453
I think that's a good idea, sir.

00:19:00.536 --> 00:19:02.246
Wait, why? What's wrong?

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.958
Attention, everyone!

00:19:08.002 --> 00:19:09.253
All right,

00:19:10.212 --> 00:19:11.839
choose your husband from among them.

00:19:12.923 --> 00:19:14.425
You think they're any better?

00:19:24.477 --> 00:19:25.519
What?

00:19:37.072 --> 00:19:38.783
MUSIC CAFÉ C'EST LA VIE
COFFEE &amp; TEA

00:19:38.866 --> 00:19:40.117
Welcome.

00:19:53.172 --> 00:19:54.799
C'est La Vie.

00:19:57.343 --> 00:19:58.469
Mr. Kim Taeyeong?

00:20:05.726 --> 00:20:06.727
Hello?

00:20:07.228 --> 00:20:10.272
Take Bus 57 and get off
at Myeonhak-ri Station.

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:19.198
Wait, too fast. Hey, slow down.

00:20:19.281 --> 00:20:20.616
Slow down. Come on.

00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:26.664
They're not going to lose us, right?

00:20:30.209 --> 00:20:32.253
Just act natural.

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:33.671
Don't be so nervous.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.881
Right.

00:20:38.801 --> 00:20:39.927
Hmm.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.011
Okay then.

00:20:41.929 --> 00:20:44.014
Mind if I ask you something?

00:20:44.098 --> 00:20:45.182
Sure, what is it?

00:20:46.392 --> 00:20:47.393
Well…

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.566
Have you always been
this good-looking, Mr. Jang?

00:20:58.153 --> 00:20:59.154
Are you…

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.076
hitting on me just to loosen up?

00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:07.288
Come on, of course not.

00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:09.832
Someone like me hitting on you? No way.

00:21:10.499 --> 00:21:12.459
You think I'd make a fool of myself,

00:21:12.543 --> 00:21:15.379
hitting on someone who's not interested?

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:18.257
I must be losing my mind.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.217
My nerves have me speaking nonsense.

00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:24.513
But I really did want to ask you that.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.017
Just forget it. I'm sorry.

00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:36.901
I hear you studied law at PNU
and took the bar exam.

00:21:36.984 --> 00:21:37.985
Ah…

00:21:38.777 --> 00:21:39.987
Yes, that's right.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.697
Will you try again this year?

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:46.076
Well, that's…

00:21:47.036 --> 00:21:48.037
Are you giving up?

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.373
Even if I pass, what's the point?

00:21:51.457 --> 00:21:53.417
They'd never appoint
a woman as a prosecutor.

00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:56.587
There isn't a single female prosecutor
in this country yet.

00:21:57.254 --> 00:21:59.131
Then why do you want to be one?

00:22:00.132 --> 00:22:01.508
Mmm…

00:22:02.217 --> 00:22:03.344
What about you, Mr. Jang?

00:22:03.427 --> 00:22:04.845
Why did you become a prosecutor?

00:22:24.657 --> 00:22:27.076
MYEONHAK-RI

00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:33.082
Mr. Jang got off the bus.

00:22:33.165 --> 00:22:35.167
All right, just keep driving for now.

00:22:35.751 --> 00:22:36.835
Yes, sir.

00:22:37.753 --> 00:22:39.338
Do they look like husband and wife?

00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:42.257
Yeah, they look good together. Sure.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.303
Do you see anything?

00:22:46.804 --> 00:22:48.472
No, nothing. It's too dark.

00:22:49.098 --> 00:22:52.142
Oh, right. You can't see a thing
without your glasses, can you?

00:22:52.226 --> 00:22:53.936
You are my eyes right now.

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:55.813
- Look carefully.
- Okay.

00:22:59.483 --> 00:23:01.485
Look. That car! Here he comes!

00:23:03.028 --> 00:23:05.114
Over there. That's him.

00:23:19.128 --> 00:23:21.088
Put your hands
in your pockets and relax.

00:23:21.171 --> 00:23:22.965
- You're as stiff as a board.
- Yes, sir.

00:23:55.873 --> 00:23:58.500
He looks familiar. Who is he?

00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:02.004
Let's see the stuff first!

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.180
Let's see the cash first.

00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:40.000
Well, this stuff is nice.

00:24:40.084 --> 00:24:41.335
Yeah, good stuff.

00:24:42.795 --> 00:24:46.632
Last night's brutal murder
of a married couple in Haeundae

00:24:46.715 --> 00:24:49.218
has been revealed to be
the work of US soldiers

00:24:49.301 --> 00:24:51.804
who had been dealing meth with them.

00:24:52.304 --> 00:24:55.641
The victims, Kim and his wife,
had a young daughter,

00:24:55.724 --> 00:24:59.937
and it was discovered that she was
present at the scene, adding to the shock.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.606
The Busan Haeundae Police
are focusing their investigation

00:25:02.689 --> 00:25:05.651
on the possibility
that the suspects committed the crime…

00:25:05.734 --> 00:25:07.194
Who the hell are you guys?

00:25:07.277 --> 00:25:08.278
This bastard.

00:25:08.821 --> 00:25:10.614
I just remembered who he is.

00:25:17.913 --> 00:25:18.956
Honey!

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:22.209
What the hell? Are you nuts?
Who the hell are you?

00:25:22.292 --> 00:25:23.585
He's asking who we are!

00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:25.504
-You insane?
-Can you believe this guy?

00:25:25.587 --> 00:25:26.839
What the fuck?

00:25:27.798 --> 00:25:28.966
You're Kang Daeil, right?

00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:30.676
The Manjae Gang's underboss?

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.191
Hey!

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.075
You son of a bitch! Hey!

00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:56.994
Hey!
Where do you think you're going?

00:25:57.077 --> 00:25:58.078
You bastard!

00:25:59.872 --> 00:26:02.457
Hey! You bastard!

00:26:03.834 --> 00:26:06.044
- Hey! Stop, you bastard!
- Stop right there!

00:26:08.797 --> 00:26:10.674
Damn! That hurts.

00:26:10.757 --> 00:26:12.718
Hey! Oh, stay right there!

00:26:13.218 --> 00:26:14.219
Hey!

00:26:16.013 --> 00:26:17.598
You're so dead!

00:26:17.681 --> 00:26:19.057
Get back here!

00:26:24.062 --> 00:26:25.522
You son of a bitch!

00:26:27.024 --> 00:26:28.025
Hey!

00:26:29.193 --> 00:26:30.527
Stop right there!

00:26:31.195 --> 00:26:32.196
Hey!

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:34.406
Where the hell do you think you're going?

00:26:34.907 --> 00:26:36.283
Hey! You little shit!

00:26:36.366 --> 00:26:38.493
God, that son of a bitch. Fucking bastard.

00:26:41.788 --> 00:26:42.956
Investigator Oh!

00:26:44.208 --> 00:26:46.168
Investigator Oh! Stop right there!

00:26:46.251 --> 00:26:50.214
Shit, she's so damn fast. Fuck!

00:26:50.297 --> 00:26:51.632
For Christ's sake!

00:27:02.434 --> 00:27:03.644
Where did he go?

00:27:10.067 --> 00:27:11.068
Goddamn it!

00:27:11.652 --> 00:27:13.320
I'm going to kill that bastard!

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:20.244
Investigator Oh!

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.538
Investigator Oh!

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.668
That girl's so damn relentless.
Fucking hell.

00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:28.752
Investigator Oh.

00:27:29.503 --> 00:27:30.504
Investigator Oh…

00:27:33.632 --> 00:27:34.633
Where is he?

00:27:35.133 --> 00:27:36.468
Where the hell did he go?

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.304
Damn, that bastard.

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:47.104
Huh?

00:27:49.189 --> 00:27:51.149
Shit…

00:27:53.819 --> 00:27:54.820
Hey.

00:27:56.446 --> 00:27:58.365
Paying respects to your ancestors?

00:27:58.448 --> 00:28:01.159
What are you doing over there
with your head on the ground?

00:28:01.702 --> 00:28:03.078
For fuck's sake.

00:28:03.161 --> 00:28:05.706
Hey, get out here. Come sit down.

00:28:06.206 --> 00:28:07.457
Fucking hell.

00:28:07.541 --> 00:28:09.918
Let's talk for a second, all right?

00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:12.421
Man, I'm fucking exhausted.

00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:17.801
Goddamn it.

00:28:19.428 --> 00:28:20.762
You can run, huh?

00:28:20.846 --> 00:28:23.348
Where's Oh, my investigator?

00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:27.978
Your investigator?
How the fuck would I know!

00:28:28.061 --> 00:28:30.105
This asshole's got
another knife. You little…

00:28:32.649 --> 00:28:34.609
Wait! Hold up. Stop.

00:28:35.235 --> 00:28:36.403
What?

00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:42.826
Shit.

00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:44.870
Come here! Get back here, you bastard!

00:28:44.953 --> 00:28:46.288
Get back here! You little…

00:28:53.003 --> 00:28:54.671
Give it a rest, jackass.

00:28:55.797 --> 00:28:58.508
How many damn knives do you have? Hey!

00:28:58.592 --> 00:29:01.094
Hey, you little… Son of a…

00:29:02.512 --> 00:29:03.805
You little shit.

00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:06.016
Get the hell off, asshole.

00:29:06.099 --> 00:29:07.726
Damn it.

00:29:11.313 --> 00:29:12.689
You son of a bitch.

00:29:12.773 --> 00:29:14.649
Hey, you son of a bitch!

00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:19.029
You asshole!

00:29:20.072 --> 00:29:21.573
Where do you think you're going?

00:29:22.157 --> 00:29:23.283
You bastard.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.747
Huh?

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:29.956
Investigator Oh.

00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:34.377
-Did you use to work out?
-My father's a tae kwon do master.

00:29:35.128 --> 00:29:37.547
-Stay still, you asshole!
-You're tough.

00:29:37.631 --> 00:29:39.007
I'll smash your face in.

00:29:40.175 --> 00:29:42.552
Not at all. I'm soft as can be.

00:29:44.179 --> 00:29:46.973
Don't ever do anything
I didn't tell you to again.

00:29:48.141 --> 00:29:49.184
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:50.811
Get up.

00:29:51.561 --> 00:29:53.021
I said, get up!

00:29:56.274 --> 00:29:58.527
- They're not up there.
- No? Not there either?

00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:59.986
I don't think they're here.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.363
Go check up there. This way.

00:30:01.446 --> 00:30:03.198
- Up there?
- Yeah, go take a look.

00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:05.575
- Mr. Jang! Mr. Jang!
- Damn.

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:08.495
Mr. Jang!

00:30:10.038 --> 00:30:11.039
You know,

00:30:12.249 --> 00:30:13.834
if you get locked up this time,

00:30:15.627 --> 00:30:16.920
it's 10 years minimum.

00:30:19.047 --> 00:30:20.215
Fuck.

00:30:21.424 --> 00:30:24.678
Ten years just for pushing some meth?
I don't think so.

00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:26.471
It's not like I killed anyone.

00:30:28.306 --> 00:30:30.433
I'll probably be out in a couple.

00:30:34.229 --> 00:30:35.480
Bullshit.

00:30:36.064 --> 00:30:39.067
The Manjae Gang's number two,
out selling drugs himself?

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.279
Why would you do that, huh?

00:30:45.907 --> 00:30:47.284
What are they saying?

00:30:49.703 --> 00:30:50.704
Hey.

00:30:52.664 --> 00:30:55.750
You've been sneaking out drugs
behind Jo Manjae's back, haven't you?

00:30:56.334 --> 00:30:57.335
If he finds out…

00:30:59.421 --> 00:31:01.756
you think he'll let you get away with it?

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.218
His number two stealing his stash?

00:31:08.054 --> 00:31:09.764
Fucking hell.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.934
So what do you want?

00:31:13.435 --> 00:31:14.853
Listen carefully.

00:31:14.936 --> 00:31:15.937
The thing is,

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.025
it's Jo Manjae that I really want.

00:31:20.859 --> 00:31:23.737
Which means you can save yourself

00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:26.114
if you just do what I say.

00:31:26.615 --> 00:31:28.617
You want me to be a goddamn rat?

00:31:29.868 --> 00:31:31.703
If I get caught, I'm the only one fucked.

00:31:31.786 --> 00:31:32.954
So why should I?

00:31:33.038 --> 00:31:35.749
Damn it, you thick-headed idiot.

00:31:35.832 --> 00:31:36.917
Hey.

00:31:38.001 --> 00:31:40.670
You dumbass.
Does your brain even work? Hmm?

00:31:41.379 --> 00:31:44.674
Do you not get
who's holding your leash right now?

00:31:44.758 --> 00:31:47.344
I don't want the small fry
with a kilo or two.

00:31:47.427 --> 00:31:50.597
I want 10 kilos or more,
the kind of deal Manjae handles himself.

00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:52.891
The choice is yours.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.477
Be a goddamn rat,

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.480
or die at Jo Manjae's hands.

00:32:04.152 --> 00:32:05.195
Investigator Oh.

00:32:11.534 --> 00:32:12.535
The key.

00:32:13.328 --> 00:32:15.413
- What key?
- To the handcuffs.

00:32:16.498 --> 00:32:17.624
Why?

00:32:27.676 --> 00:32:29.636
Huh? Huh?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.889
Huh?

00:32:33.682 --> 00:32:34.683
What…

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:38.436
Get out of here. Go.

00:32:39.271 --> 00:32:40.855
What? Oh!

00:32:41.773 --> 00:32:44.442
Mr. Jang! What the hell are you doing?

00:32:45.652 --> 00:32:47.988
-I let him go.
-Why?

00:32:48.071 --> 00:32:50.490
This stays between you and me.

00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:54.077
It's our little secret.

00:32:56.288 --> 00:32:57.747
His mother is dead.

00:32:58.248 --> 00:33:00.583
He's got a father and a younger sister.

00:33:00.667 --> 00:33:02.794
Yes, the father's name is Jang Myeongho.

00:33:02.877 --> 00:33:04.462
He's in a psychiatric hospital.

00:33:05.088 --> 00:33:06.548
Psychiatric hospital?

00:33:06.631 --> 00:33:08.967
He's been there a long time,
about 20 years.

00:33:09.926 --> 00:33:10.969
What for?

00:33:11.052 --> 00:33:12.053
I'm looking into it.

00:33:12.762 --> 00:33:13.805
What about his sister?

00:33:14.431 --> 00:33:16.224
Jang Hyeeun, 25 years old.

00:33:16.808 --> 00:33:20.312
She works at a dye factory in Gyeonggi-do.
There's nothing unusual about her.

00:33:20.395 --> 00:33:21.855
Check the people around him too.

00:33:22.355 --> 00:33:24.274
Report back if you find anything useful.

00:33:24.357 --> 00:33:25.400
Yes, sir.

00:33:25.483 --> 00:33:30.155
And about Ikeda Yuji,
the one you mentioned last time.

00:33:30.238 --> 00:33:31.656
Did you look into her?

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.116
Her real name is Choi Yuji.

00:33:33.658 --> 00:33:34.826
She's a Zainichi.

00:33:36.703 --> 00:33:37.704
A Zainichi?

00:33:37.787 --> 00:33:40.749
Yes, she lost both her parents
when she was 13.

00:33:40.832 --> 00:33:43.168
Then Chairman Ikeda adopted her.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.129
He seems to put a lot of trust in her.

00:33:46.212 --> 00:33:48.214
She's got real pull in the organization,

00:33:48.298 --> 00:33:50.258
with plenty of people gunning for her.

00:33:50.342 --> 00:33:51.551
Choi Yuji.

00:33:52.677 --> 00:33:53.887
I'll see you again.

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:07.692
Look at that idiot.

00:34:13.365 --> 00:34:16.242
But why are you looking into Choi Yuji?

00:34:20.914 --> 00:34:21.915
I'm sorry.

00:34:25.585 --> 00:34:27.796
Choi Yuji…

00:34:28.713 --> 00:34:32.175
While you were out earlier,
Mr. Baek Kihyun called.

00:34:32.258 --> 00:34:33.259
What did he say?

00:34:33.343 --> 00:34:36.262
He's coming today
for your mother's memorial.

00:34:37.013 --> 00:34:38.556
He said he couldn't make it.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.891
He's in the army, right?

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.938
Top of his class at the Military Academy.

00:34:45.021 --> 00:34:46.981
Top of his class…

00:34:47.065 --> 00:34:49.776
It's just a matter of time
before he pins on a star, right?

00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:52.070
A star? Sure, he'll get one.

00:34:53.321 --> 00:34:55.198
The question is, how many.

00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:05.583
Hey, Baek Kihyun.

00:36:02.891 --> 00:36:03.892
Let's eat.

00:36:05.643 --> 00:36:07.103
Thank you for the meal.

00:36:09.856 --> 00:36:15.111
Kihyun was only in first
or second grade when Mom passed.

00:36:16.237 --> 00:36:18.406
Time really flies. Doesn't it, Kitae?

00:36:20.909 --> 00:36:23.244
How's life in the army? Doing all right?

00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:25.663
I'm doing fine.

00:36:28.082 --> 00:36:29.167
Is something up?

00:36:31.628 --> 00:36:33.296
I wish it were.

00:36:38.092 --> 00:36:40.595
Staring at barbed wire
on the front line is boring, no?

00:36:40.678 --> 00:36:42.305
SECURITY COMMAND
AHN SEUNGHYEOK

00:36:42.388 --> 00:36:44.974
He'll let you know once a spot opens up
at Security Command.

00:36:46.017 --> 00:36:48.895
You always wanted to go there
after graduating the academy.

00:36:50.146 --> 00:36:51.815
I can take care of myself.

00:36:53.399 --> 00:36:55.610
Just let me help you.
What are big brothers for?

00:36:55.693 --> 00:36:57.111
Right, Soyeong?

00:36:57.695 --> 00:36:58.696
You're right.

00:37:00.281 --> 00:37:03.284
But you know, Kihyun's all grown up now.

00:37:03.785 --> 00:37:05.578
His opinion matters too.

00:37:14.045 --> 00:37:15.296
Just take it.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.924
I'm sure plenty of others got his card.

00:37:19.467 --> 00:37:20.593
I told you.

00:37:21.219 --> 00:37:23.847
In the end, guys with money
and connections run the world.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:28.142
That's true. Life is brutal
without parents or connections.

00:37:28.226 --> 00:37:30.395
But things get easier
if you have money and power.

00:37:30.478 --> 00:37:31.521
Funny how that works.

00:37:35.441 --> 00:37:36.609
Kitae.

00:37:40.613 --> 00:37:42.031
I can take care of myself.

00:37:46.536 --> 00:37:47.537
Fine.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.414
Let me know if you change your mind.

00:37:59.757 --> 00:38:04.095
So, your plan is to use Kang Daeil
as a mole to get Jo Manjae?

00:38:05.096 --> 00:38:06.097
Yes.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:12.520
But what if Kang Daeil doesn't
play along and just disappears on you?

00:38:12.604 --> 00:38:14.731
What are you going to do then?

00:38:16.524 --> 00:38:19.861
He'll have no choice but to do as I say
if he wants to stay alive.

00:38:19.944 --> 00:38:21.696
How can you be so sure?

00:38:21.779 --> 00:38:23.656
Because Kang Daeil, that punk,

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.117
has been skimming drugs
behind his boss's back.

00:38:26.743 --> 00:38:30.330
It means being a number two
isn't enough for him.

00:38:30.413 --> 00:38:32.123
What are you…

00:38:32.206 --> 00:38:33.791
I promised him

00:38:34.709 --> 00:38:38.463
I'd make him number one in the gang.

00:38:39.339 --> 00:38:41.049
Once I take down Jo Manjae,

00:38:41.132 --> 00:38:44.052
Kang Daeil becomes the boss of the gang.

00:38:48.306 --> 00:38:49.307
So then,

00:38:50.892 --> 00:38:54.854
you're going to take down Jo Manjae,
but really just let Kang Daeil walk free?

00:39:00.193 --> 00:39:01.736
First, I take down Jo Manjae.

00:39:02.612 --> 00:39:04.614
Then, I'll put Kang Daeil behind bars too.

00:39:12.455 --> 00:39:13.456
Mr. Jang.

00:39:13.957 --> 00:39:15.083
Yeah.

00:39:15.166 --> 00:39:16.918
You know Alain Delon, right?

00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:18.544
Alain Delon? What about him?

00:39:18.628 --> 00:39:20.755
You know, in those movies,

00:39:21.339 --> 00:39:26.344
he goes around killing people brutally
with that handsome face.

00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:30.723
And then he smokes,
just like you are right now.

00:39:32.141 --> 00:39:33.601
Yeah. That's it.

00:39:38.064 --> 00:39:42.944
Every time I watch him,
I get butterflies for some reason.

00:39:43.778 --> 00:39:46.531
People must tell you all the time
you look like him, right?

00:39:52.578 --> 00:39:54.247
Enough with the nonsense.

00:39:56.124 --> 00:39:57.583
Take a look at this photo.

00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:04.549
That guy next to Jo Manjae.

00:40:06.467 --> 00:40:09.303
Looks like Jo Manjae's bowing
and scraping to him.

00:40:09.387 --> 00:40:11.222
Who's the guy, his backer?

00:40:11.305 --> 00:40:14.350
We'll know who he is
once we've got Jo Manjae.

00:40:18.563 --> 00:40:20.565
Wow, there's another Alain Delon here.

00:40:22.525 --> 00:40:26.529
Just how many Alain Delons
do you see exactly?

00:40:27.113 --> 00:40:30.658
Me? Only one, of course.

00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:34.537
Cheers.

00:40:58.936 --> 00:41:01.355
9TH, 8 P.M.
ROOM 611, BUSAN HOTEL

00:41:14.118 --> 00:41:16.871
Ms. Oh, the phone.

00:41:20.083 --> 00:41:22.251
- Hello?
- Is this the Chinese restaurant?

00:41:22.919 --> 00:41:24.378
No, it's not.

00:41:24.462 --> 00:41:26.172
Sorry about that.

00:41:26.923 --> 00:41:27.924
What the hell?

00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:30.676
Is there something wrong with our number?

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.761
What's up?

00:41:31.844 --> 00:41:33.679
Well, we keep getting wrong numbers.

00:41:33.763 --> 00:41:36.474
Someone else called earlier asking
if this was a bathhouse.

00:41:36.557 --> 00:41:37.600
It's so weird.

00:41:37.683 --> 00:41:39.018
Let's go eat.

00:41:39.102 --> 00:41:40.645
Yes, sir.

00:41:42.897 --> 00:41:45.024
What should we have today?

00:41:45.108 --> 00:41:46.609
Man, I'm starving.

00:41:46.692 --> 00:41:49.028
Pork and rice soup? What do you think?

00:41:49.112 --> 00:41:50.279
But we had it yesterday.

00:41:50.363 --> 00:41:53.199
- You're right.
- How about a set meal?

00:41:53.282 --> 00:41:54.909
Sounds good to me.

00:41:56.869 --> 00:41:58.246
Wait for me!

00:41:58.913 --> 00:42:00.164
How about jjajangmyeon?

00:42:08.965 --> 00:42:10.049
No answer.

00:42:22.478 --> 00:42:25.481

Look at all this crap.

PORT OF BUSAN METH SMUGGLING

THE MANJAE GANG

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.421
Hey, Jang.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.172
Join me for lunch.

00:44:56.007 --> 00:44:58.301
I'm meeting with the chief editor
of Joguk Ilbo.

00:44:58.384 --> 00:45:01.595
-You haven't eaten yet, have you?
-Oh, dear. I just ate, actually.

00:45:02.346 --> 00:45:04.265
Yeah? Then drop by my office later.

00:45:04.348 --> 00:45:06.600
- I've got something to tell you.
- Yes, sir.

00:45:06.684 --> 00:45:09.520
Right. I'll be tied up
questioning suspects this afternoon.

00:45:09.603 --> 00:45:10.730
I'll come by tomorrow morning.

00:45:10.813 --> 00:45:12.148
- All right.
- Yeah.

00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:15.151
Hey, Jang! You'd better show up!

00:45:16.986 --> 00:45:17.987
Let's clear out.

00:46:12.958 --> 00:46:17.838
Looks like everyone thoughtlessly
ran off to lunch once again,

00:46:17.922 --> 00:46:20.800
with papers lying around
and the door unlocked.

00:46:21.967 --> 00:46:23.135
And you are?

00:46:28.224 --> 00:46:31.685
I'm Baek Kitae, KCIA Busan branch.

00:46:31.769 --> 00:46:33.813
This guy's name

00:46:33.896 --> 00:46:35.523
is Baek Kitae.

00:46:35.606 --> 00:46:37.316
That guy next to Jo Manjae.

00:46:39.568 --> 00:46:41.028
He's with the KCIA?

00:46:42.029 --> 00:46:44.281
Jang Geonyoung,
Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

00:46:47.827 --> 00:46:50.621
So, what brings the KCIA all the way here?

00:46:50.704 --> 00:46:52.623
There must be a reason

00:46:52.706 --> 00:46:56.627
you're standing in the middle of
someone else's office while they're out.

00:46:58.462 --> 00:46:59.630
You know Jo Manjae, right?

00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:02.091
The Manjae Gang's number one.

00:47:02.174 --> 00:47:03.217
Right, the Manjae Gang.

00:47:04.218 --> 00:47:05.219
I came here

00:47:06.554 --> 00:47:09.390
to ask you to drop Jo Manjae. Lay off him.

00:47:14.937 --> 00:47:18.065
You're telling me
to shut down my investigation?

00:47:18.732 --> 00:47:19.984
The KCIA

00:47:21.318 --> 00:47:22.862
giving orders to a prosecutor?

00:47:25.865 --> 00:47:27.741
I didn't mean it like that.

00:47:29.785 --> 00:47:30.995
Then what?

00:47:31.579 --> 00:47:33.289
At least give me a proper explanation.

00:47:37.543 --> 00:47:41.338
Did you know Jo Manjae's
married to a Zainichi?

00:47:41.422 --> 00:47:42.465
Yes.

00:47:46.093 --> 00:47:47.928
According to our recent intel,

00:47:48.637 --> 00:47:51.557
his wife has been deeply involved
with North Korea.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.729
Ah.

00:47:58.063 --> 00:48:00.524
So Jo Manjae is tangled up
with commies now, huh?

00:48:00.608 --> 00:48:04.153
We got word that his gang's been
pushing meth up North through Japan.

00:48:04.236 --> 00:48:06.947
We've been running an operation
on this for over a year now.

00:48:07.907 --> 00:48:10.701
I went undercover
to make contact with Jo Manjae myself.

00:48:10.784 --> 00:48:14.079
So you're saying,
the KCIA's already working him,

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.332
and I'm supposed to back off?

00:48:16.415 --> 00:48:18.292
We're all civil servants here.

00:48:18.375 --> 00:48:20.252
We should help one another, shouldn't we?

00:48:20.794 --> 00:48:22.630
It's all for the country after all.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.389
Okay!

00:48:32.473 --> 00:48:33.849
Got it.

00:48:34.808 --> 00:48:36.477
I'll leave Jo Manjae to you then.

00:48:37.186 --> 00:48:38.938
That goddamn commie.

00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:41.524
Thank you for understanding.

00:48:41.607 --> 00:48:43.275
Gosh, don't mention it.

00:48:43.817 --> 00:48:46.070
You moved to Busan
about two months ago, right?

00:48:46.153 --> 00:48:47.321
Yeah, that's right.

00:48:47.905 --> 00:48:51.075
You're from Seoul, so I bet
it hasn't been easy settling in here.

00:48:51.867 --> 00:48:53.994
We should grab some raw fish sometime.

00:48:54.078 --> 00:48:55.871
I'll take you someplace nice.

00:48:55.955 --> 00:48:58.165
Ah, actually…

00:49:00.209 --> 00:49:02.002
I'm not really into raw fish.

00:49:02.836 --> 00:49:04.421
When we get the chance,

00:49:04.505 --> 00:49:07.216
let's have some soju instead,
with pork and rice soup.

00:49:07.299 --> 00:49:08.300
That sounds good too.

00:49:08.842 --> 00:49:10.636
All right, then. I'll give you a call.

00:49:28.195 --> 00:49:30.322
Jo Manjae is…

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.785
tied up with commies, huh?

00:49:46.422 --> 00:49:47.798
Yeah, right.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.759
Who the hell does he think he's fooling?

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.076
- Let's go eat.
- Yes, sir.

00:50:27.421 --> 00:50:29.923
Mr. Jang isn't here yet.

00:50:34.136 --> 00:50:36.430
- Turn the lights off.
- Damn, you scared me.

00:50:37.014 --> 00:50:38.724
It's broad daylight.

00:50:38.807 --> 00:50:40.017
I didn't see you there.

00:50:41.268 --> 00:50:42.978
Save if you want a better life.

00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:47.399
Well, I picked up some lunch for you.

00:50:47.983 --> 00:50:49.026
Have you eaten yet?

00:50:49.693 --> 00:50:50.694
No.

00:50:51.362 --> 00:50:52.738
Where's Mr. Kim and…

00:50:52.821 --> 00:50:54.073
Where is everyone?

00:50:54.156 --> 00:50:55.824
He said he was going to court.

00:50:55.908 --> 00:50:58.035
The other investigators
are out at the scene.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:11.924
Were you hungry?

00:51:12.007 --> 00:51:14.176
Slow down, or you'll get indigestion.

00:51:14.259 --> 00:51:17.096
Here. Take a look.

00:51:20.557 --> 00:51:21.850
What's this?

00:51:23.268 --> 00:51:24.853
9TH, 8 P.M.
ROOM 611, BUSAN HOTEL

00:51:24.937 --> 00:51:26.897
He says the Yakuza's coming to Busan.

00:51:28.482 --> 00:51:29.525
The Yakuza?

00:51:29.608 --> 00:51:30.609
Yes.

00:51:32.027 --> 00:51:35.406
He's meeting Jo Manjae at Busan Hotel.

00:51:35.489 --> 00:51:38.033
Uh… It's about the meth, right?

00:51:39.159 --> 00:51:40.411
That's what it looks like.

00:51:41.036 --> 00:51:42.037
Damn.

00:51:43.539 --> 00:51:44.915
This time…

00:51:47.084 --> 00:51:49.169
we have to get Jo Manjae.

00:51:51.463 --> 00:51:52.464
Hang on.

00:51:53.173 --> 00:51:54.174
The 9th?

00:51:54.675 --> 00:51:56.552
That's the day after tomorrow, isn't it?

00:51:56.635 --> 00:51:58.637
That's right.
The day after tomorrow.

00:51:59.555 --> 00:52:02.391
Oh, right. The KCIA was here earlier.

00:52:05.269 --> 00:52:07.604
- The KCIA? W-Why?
- Yeah.

00:52:08.188 --> 00:52:09.189
What business…

00:52:10.899 --> 00:52:12.025
could they possibly have

00:52:12.776 --> 00:52:14.862
here at the Busan District
Prosecutors' Office?

00:52:14.945 --> 00:52:16.238
What could've brought the KCIA here?

00:52:16.321 --> 00:52:19.241
Exactly.
What could've brought them here?

00:52:19.324 --> 00:52:20.409
Look at this guy.

00:53:22.012 --> 00:53:23.138
Boss, he's here.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.807
Yeah? All right.

00:53:28.977 --> 00:53:31.814
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Jo Manjae.

00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:38.237
He says hello.

00:53:38.987 --> 00:53:40.864
Have a seat.

00:53:47.663 --> 00:53:51.291
So, is this your first time in Busan?

00:53:59.007 --> 00:54:00.843
He used to live here as a kid.

00:54:02.052 --> 00:54:04.721
So he's a Zainichi?

00:54:12.187 --> 00:54:15.607
He's Japanese, and he was here in 1944.

00:54:17.651 --> 00:54:19.027
That's before liberation.

00:54:20.404 --> 00:54:25.951
My grandfather was killed by a Jap bullet
at the Battle of Cheongsan-ri, you know.

00:54:26.034 --> 00:54:28.620
Uh…

00:54:28.704 --> 00:54:29.705
Well…

00:54:35.836 --> 00:54:37.045
Well, never mind.

00:54:38.213 --> 00:54:41.967
History's history,
and business is business, eh?

00:54:44.595 --> 00:54:46.096
Go get the stuff.

00:54:46.597 --> 00:54:48.932
Uh… We'll bring it to you now.

00:54:56.648 --> 00:54:57.816
Looks good.

00:54:58.942 --> 00:55:00.319
But…

00:55:01.862 --> 00:55:04.031
you think you can move
10 kilos every month?

00:55:05.324 --> 00:55:07.618
He's asking if we can do
10 kilos every month.

00:55:08.368 --> 00:55:09.786
Let's see the cash first.

00:55:14.791 --> 00:55:15.792
Hey.

00:55:23.008 --> 00:55:25.052
Tell him we can do 20 kilos.

00:55:29.556 --> 00:55:31.058
That's impressive.

00:55:32.517 --> 00:55:33.518
"Sugoi"?

00:55:34.478 --> 00:55:36.104
"Sugoi" means "impressive."

00:55:39.399 --> 00:55:40.567
Cheers.

00:55:44.196 --> 00:55:46.490
Sounds like they're hitting it off, huh?

00:55:48.033 --> 00:55:49.242
All right.

00:55:49.826 --> 00:55:51.828
I'd say we're good to go.

00:56:01.338 --> 00:56:02.547
We got it on tape, right?

00:56:06.218 --> 00:56:07.219
All right.

00:56:07.302 --> 00:56:10.013
Everyone, grab your gear. Let's go.

00:56:14.518 --> 00:56:15.519
Move in.

00:56:22.567 --> 00:56:24.778
Turn the light on. The light.

00:56:24.861 --> 00:56:27.614
I think it's a blackout. What do we do?

00:56:34.204 --> 00:56:36.456
- Hey, go see what's going on.
- Yes, sir.

00:56:41.712 --> 00:56:43.213
What the hell?

00:56:45.632 --> 00:56:47.384
Stop resisting, you bastards!

00:56:47.467 --> 00:56:49.970
- On your knees, punk!
- On your knees!

00:56:52.264 --> 00:56:53.557
Open the door!

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.184
Hey, you bastard!

00:57:01.106 --> 00:57:02.649
Open the fucking door!

00:57:14.369 --> 00:57:15.787
All clear, sir.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.763
Open the door! Hey, open the door!

00:57:47.235 --> 00:57:48.737
Get the tear gas!

00:57:50.614 --> 00:57:51.948
Head on the ground, asshole!

00:57:52.532 --> 00:57:53.533
Hey!

00:58:15.138 --> 00:58:16.640
Hey, the tear gas!

00:58:18.099 --> 00:58:19.810
Shit, it's hot!

00:58:19.893 --> 00:58:21.186
It's hot!

00:58:24.272 --> 00:58:25.774
Move!

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:28.568
Move!

00:58:28.652 --> 00:58:30.195
Move!

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.945
Do you not realize how serious this is?

00:59:12.863 --> 00:59:14.865
The Japanese Metropolitan
Police Department

00:59:14.948 --> 00:59:17.200
put those Yakuza bastards
on the wanted list.

00:59:17.868 --> 00:59:20.620
They even sent over a formal request
for cooperation, Mr. Jo.

00:59:20.704 --> 00:59:24.291
Sir, I'm really sorry
we didn't clear it with you first.

00:59:24.958 --> 00:59:27.794
But still, after everything
we've paid up until now,

00:59:27.878 --> 00:59:29.921
isn't this the time
you step in and cover us?

00:59:30.005 --> 00:59:31.256
Who the hell is this guy?

00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:35.385
Sir, please forgive him.

00:59:35.468 --> 00:59:38.388
This guy doesn't…
He doesn't know any better.

00:59:38.471 --> 00:59:39.890
It won't happen again.

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.684
We just got a little greedy and messed up.

00:59:42.767 --> 00:59:47.397
If you help us out just this once,
we'll make sure to pay you back for it!

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.692
Wow. This one's got
more guts than him, right?

00:59:50.775 --> 00:59:51.943
Hey, you're better.

00:59:52.485 --> 00:59:54.529
Yeah, you're right.

00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:57.407
He's got guts.
If you'd forgive us just this once…

01:00:05.081 --> 01:00:07.584
Shut it.

01:00:17.469 --> 01:00:20.263
Sir, it's probably best to leave him.

01:00:21.056 --> 01:00:24.768
We'll need someone to pull the gang
back together as their new leader.

01:00:29.481 --> 01:00:31.274
The election's right around the corner.

01:00:41.076 --> 01:00:42.285
You think you can do well?

01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:45.830
Yes, sir.

01:00:46.373 --> 01:00:47.374
Yeah?

01:00:59.928 --> 01:01:01.471
On your knees!

01:01:01.554 --> 01:01:04.265
- Stay still!
- Stop resisting!

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.060
On your knees!

01:01:07.143 --> 01:01:09.854
- Stay still!
- Stop resisting!

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:12.190
On your knees!

01:01:12.273 --> 01:01:14.818
- Stay still!
- Stop resisting!

01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:22.242
Who the hell screwed us over
and snatched Jo Manjae?

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:25.620
- Hello. So…
- Morning, sir.

01:01:25.704 --> 01:01:29.457
Did you guys clean the office yet?

01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:32.502
- Clean?
- No, we didn't…

01:01:32.585 --> 01:01:34.629
How many times
have I told you to clean up?

01:01:34.713 --> 01:01:36.214
Just look at this place!

01:01:36.297 --> 01:01:37.632
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Huh?

01:01:37.716 --> 01:01:41.136
Ms. Oh, go and…
Go get the broom and the dustpan.

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:43.138
Yes, sir.
I'll bring the dustpan and sweep up.

01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:46.641
And these useless boxes.
Get them all out to the storage room!

01:01:46.725 --> 01:01:48.018
Okay, I'll clear them out.

01:01:48.101 --> 01:01:50.228
And what the hell
is this bag doing here, huh?

01:01:50.311 --> 01:01:52.313
Why would you leave
a bag lying around here?

01:01:52.397 --> 01:01:53.982
- I'm sorry.
- I'll put it away.

01:02:05.535 --> 01:02:06.911
Lay low for a while.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.665
You don't have to give me all this.

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.210
I won't breathe a word to Director Hwang.

01:02:14.294 --> 01:02:15.628
Don't worry, sir.

01:02:17.422 --> 01:02:19.466
If I was worried
about you running your mouth,

01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:21.092
I would've let you die back there.

01:02:21.926 --> 01:02:23.178
Then why did you…

01:02:23.261 --> 01:02:24.262
I told you.

01:02:25.472 --> 01:02:27.766
You're Jo Manjae's replacement now.

01:02:27.849 --> 01:02:29.934
The whole gang's already in pieces,

01:02:31.061 --> 01:02:33.104
so why would you even need a replacement?

01:02:34.689 --> 01:02:35.690
The business.

01:02:36.566 --> 01:02:38.318
You've got to keep it going, don't you?

01:02:38.818 --> 01:02:42.322
All right, open up the cabinet
and toss out all those old files!

01:02:42.405 --> 01:02:43.406
Yes, sir. I will.

01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:45.617
How many times
have I told you to clean that out?

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.202
I'm sorry.

01:02:53.374 --> 01:02:55.710
And this box!

01:02:55.794 --> 01:02:57.921
- That's…
- I told you a hundred times

01:02:58.004 --> 01:03:00.173
- to throw it out already! Geez!
- That… I'm sorry!

01:03:00.256 --> 01:03:02.717
Mr. Jang, please
just leave it. We'll take care of it.

01:03:02.801 --> 01:03:04.594
Just leave it. We'll do it.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.517
Me?

01:03:14.104 --> 01:03:15.105
You.

01:03:16.106 --> 01:03:17.107
Me.

01:03:17.857 --> 01:03:20.110
Us.

01:03:23.863 --> 01:03:25.782
That meth business of yours.

01:03:27.826 --> 01:03:30.036
I've had my eye on it for a long time.

01:03:31.121 --> 01:03:32.705
Mr. Baek, I heard

01:03:33.623 --> 01:03:36.501
you'll be going to Japan soon.

01:03:36.584 --> 01:03:37.961
Would it be all right

01:03:38.503 --> 01:03:40.588
if I asked you a small favor on your way?

01:03:41.506 --> 01:03:45.093
That's why
I did you guys the favor.

01:03:46.886 --> 01:03:50.140
I'll figure out a way to reopen
the connection with the Japanese.

01:03:50.932 --> 01:03:52.016
In the meantime,

01:03:52.767 --> 01:03:54.978
you take that money,
pull the guys back together,

01:03:55.603 --> 01:03:57.730
and get the lab running again.

01:03:58.398 --> 01:04:00.358
You want to sell the drugs yourself?

01:04:02.277 --> 01:04:03.278
But…

01:04:03.945 --> 01:04:05.905
A government man dealing drugs…

01:04:08.074 --> 01:04:09.075
What?

01:04:11.119 --> 01:04:12.120
Is that a problem?

01:04:13.121 --> 01:04:14.122
No, sir.

01:04:14.622 --> 01:04:15.623
Not at all.

01:04:21.546 --> 01:04:23.673
I thought
they were just petty thieves,

01:04:24.174 --> 01:04:27.385
but turns out those bastards
are a lot more audacious than I expected.

01:04:27.468 --> 01:04:30.805
I'm Baek Kitae, KCIA Busan branch.

01:04:30.889 --> 01:04:33.141
Mr. Baek Kitae.

01:04:33.224 --> 01:04:35.310
Looks like we'll be seeing
a lot of each other from now on.

01:04:46.112 --> 01:04:48.114
All right, that's enough cleaning!

01:04:48.198 --> 01:04:49.449
Let's get to work!

01:07:23.811 --> 01:07:25.813
