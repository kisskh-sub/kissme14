00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.040
Thank you

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.120
for letting me stay at Yashe.

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.319
Thank you

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.799
for letting me stay here.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.239
Cheers.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.879
My Qing dynasty rosary!

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.319
What did you do to it?

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.159
Let me see.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.719
Grab some tissue.

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:09.560
This is basically

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.360
ruined for good.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.759
This thing can't get wet.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.080
Sorry, Master Dong.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.879
This is nice.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.000
Bizhi.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.680
You're getting bolder these days.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.960
You even dare to fool me now?

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:43.280
Careful what you say.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.120
Market Lord.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120
I wasn't fooling you.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.439
At most, I was buying time.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.355
All that repainting was for you.

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:49.840
You knew he was just an ordinary person.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.039
So why didn't you tell me?

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.680
Finding out now isn't too late.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.199
Do you know
how much risk I took to help you?

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.680
You were playing with fire.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.080
Calm down.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.080
You'll get dark circles and fine lines.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.240
If you'd cut ties with Su Beilu earlier,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.800
he wouldn't have
taken the chance to use Yashe.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.439
You almost caused a real disaster.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.159
I was the one who cleared things up
with the Time Administration.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.319
Otherwise, you'd already
have been taken away.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.919
That's why it has to be you.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.919
Tianguang Market depends on you.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.199
Who else could handle this?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.039
Market Lord?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.840
I doubt I can
keep that title much longer.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.800
Find someone else.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.639
You should go.

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.159
Tell me.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.080
If I really went and found someone else,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.560
who would I give all these gifts to?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.759
What gifts?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.159
The most fashionable

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.199
rouge and face powders around right now.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.680
They can cover up any flaw.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.520
It's a remarkable product.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.840
Don't you want to try it, Market Lord?

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.840
Let me see it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.040
You've got taste.

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.720
Actually,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.720
this is a gesture from Su Beilu.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.480
Look here.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.240
This one is contour.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.319
This one is a highlight.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.822
These two matte shades are blush,

00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:37.750
and these two shimmery ones
are eyeshadow.

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:38.639
Got it?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.959
Aren't these two colors
almost the same?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.519
They are.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.879
Not even close, okay?

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.279
This one's for the face,

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.560
and these two are for the eyes.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.920
And these here.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.319
This is the blush brush,

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.720
and this is for contour.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.240
These really look the same, though.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.399
They're obviously different.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:59.399
Never thought that guy
who's usually so clueless

00:04:59.644 --> 00:05:01.120
would actually be this thoughtful.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.519
He's got a sharp eye.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.639
Sit down.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.759
Thank you, Market Lord.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.040
Are you planning
to keep him by your side?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.600
Didn't you just say he's thoughtful?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.079
An extra person means extra help.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.240
Have you forgotten
the advice I gave you?

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:20.480
I wouldn't forget.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:23.879
It's just that...

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.319
Just what?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.680
It's just

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.120
even though he's not Ziyi,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.279
he's still my friend.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.319
And once I finish
collecting these artifacts,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.959
I'll be returning to my own time.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.560
(But you still only need three antiques)

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:45.879
(to collect.)

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:51.660
(Treasure Trove)

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.000
Sorry, Tuanzi.

00:06:25.822 --> 00:06:26.680
It's not your fault.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.155
I just...

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.399
I'm still not quite used to it.

00:07:00.577 --> 00:07:01.750
Even if I'm not used to it,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.920
it's still good.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.879
Time to eat.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:09.639
Coming.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.759
No takeaway today.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:13.680
I made everything myself.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.879
Thanks.

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:15.959
You worked hard.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.800
I left your milk on the counter.

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:21.879
Thanks.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.240
Seafood noodles are ready.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.120
Healthier than instant noodles.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.839
Come try some.

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:40.120
Looks good.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.560
Tuanzi.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.160
Breakfast time.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.160
Tuanzi.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.800
There's an extra treat today.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.240
I swear I grabbed two just now.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.040
Here.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.600
Tuanzi.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.480
Your chew stick.

00:08:16.444 --> 00:08:17.390
Stop standing there.

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:18.360
Eat up.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.680
Okay.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.120
Try it.

00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:32.120
I went to the market early
for the seafood.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.260
I cleaned out the shrimp veins.

00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:33.790
Really?

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.039
It tastes good.

00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:45.311
Didn't expect someone
who's usually so scatterbrained

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.039
to be a decent cook.

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:50.390
I only know
how to make this one noodle dish.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.399
Nothing else.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:52.279
Why not?

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.440
When I was little, my grandma told me

00:08:55.822 --> 00:08:57.444
that as long as I could make this,

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.960
I'd never go hungry again.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.279
Once I learned it,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.200
she finally felt at ease.

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:08.799
It's good.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.200
Su Beilu,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200
your phone's ringing.

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:29.480
Who is it?

00:09:35.222 --> 00:09:36.200
(Your Good Friend)

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.000
Your good friend.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.440
Can you pick it up for me?

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.600
I'm a bit busy right now.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.500
(Your Good Friend)

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:46.360
Mister!

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:47.629
See?

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.355
Using a phone isn't that hard, is it?

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.200
That phone is the gift I gave you.

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:53.480
And, well,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.080
your good friend

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.919
is me.

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:56.919
I've got

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:57.840
your number, too,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.480
so now we can keep in touch anytime.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.679
I don't need this.

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:04.519
You can't say you don't need it.

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:07.240
I saved up for it by working part-time.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.919
Part-time?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.679
You might be from the future,

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.759
but still,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.120
you don't have to look down
on our modern communication.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.000
Do you even know

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:42.720
how to use it?

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.840
It's too simple for someone like me.

00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:50.960
What's so hard about it?

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.200
There are buttons.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.279
It shut down.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.080
It's okay.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.120
I'll use mine to show you.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.840
It's simple.

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:05.360
Look.

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:06.840
With this yellow one,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:07.960
you can order food.

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:09.600
This green one

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:11.080
is how we can chat.

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.039
And this one with three colors,

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:15.440
that's for watching shows and movies.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.120
Most importantly,

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.733
even though you're from the future,

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:20.919
once you've got this phone,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.399
you're officially

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:24.919
a proper modern person.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.360
So you can't refuse it.

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.120
Thank you.

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:31.600
I'll make good use of it.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.799
How do I turn it on?

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:42.879
You...

00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:45.120
The same button you used to turn it off.

00:11:45.133 --> 00:11:45.750
This button?

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:46.480
Yeah.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.200
It's on.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.679
(Luoxia Manor)

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:56.240
Three pairs.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:56.720
Nope.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.399
Pass.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:58.919
Straight.

00:11:59.039 --> 00:11:59.600
Pass.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.240
Pass.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.559
No one's playing, right?

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.639
Double jokers.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.320
Who's supposed to beat that?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:06.919
Bizhi.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.960
A single three.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.360
Double tribute.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.559
I'm done playing.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.080
Come on, one more round.

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:16.279
Can't handle losing, huh?

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:17.490
Have you played this before?

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.159
No.

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:20.279
Are you from the twenty-first century?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.960
Of course...

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.159
not.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.279
How are you so good at this game?

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:25.120
He's clueless.

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:27.509
I mean he is very smart.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.622
He just wasn't as good
as me when he first started.

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:31.960
Do you count cards or something?

00:12:31.977 --> 00:12:33.440
The Market Lord excels at calculations

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.577
with photographic memory.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.519
That figures.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.480
No wonder you're the Market Lord.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.360
Come on, one more round.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:40.879
No more.

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:41.879
We're done.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.879
Don't give them a chance to get even.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.600
The two of us have
business to attend to.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.759
Market Lord.

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:52.039
Thanks, Market Lord.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.559
Boring.

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:57.240
Wait.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.600
Haven't you been
getting a bit distracted lately?

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.399
No, I haven't.

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:03.519
You still deny it?

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:06.120
Just look at the clues
you've been writing.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.799
Each one's simpler than the last,

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:09.360
and vaguer, too.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.440
Now there's not even
a surname or a name.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.622
How are we supposed to search?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.120
The year and the location
are written right there.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.919
Isn't that way easier
than blindly searching like before?

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.600
Providing clues is your responsibility.

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:23.559
Besides,

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.600
you've already taken the gift.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.869
Once you get to that place,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.000
just look into the owner
of the item, and you'll know.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.000
Besides,

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.240
you're not fighting this alone anymore.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.039
Right?

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:35.840
Butler Su?

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.240
I'm not a butler.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.039
I'm a partner.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:39.879
A partner?

00:13:39.879 --> 00:13:40.559
Market Lord,

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.200
that Wu Blade

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.639
slipped away right under your nose.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.355
(Lu Feng, living in the 21st century)
Xia Zelan.

00:13:48.377 --> 00:13:49.333
Lu Feng.

00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:51.399
So that was Lu Feng just now.

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.799
If this Kun Blade gets away again...

00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:55.440
Enough.

00:13:55.977 --> 00:13:57.270
This time, I won't charge you.

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:57.799
Satisfied?

00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:59.720
Is this really about payment?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.159
The Kunwu Blade?

00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:03.360
That womanizing artist?

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:04.320
That's him.

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:49.799
(No matter what the cost,)

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.120
(I'll find you.)

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:53.799
(Lan.)

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.820
(Kun Blade, Qinglong era, Lin'an City)

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.000
This information is way too vague.

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:18.000
There's not even a clear location.

00:15:18.155 --> 00:15:19.440
How am I supposed to find it?

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:23.000
We're closed today.
Come back another time.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:24.519
It's me.

00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:38.840
Sorry to bother you.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.720
Do you remember me?

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.879
I'm Lu Feng.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.320
Of course.

00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:45.377
How could I forget?

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:46.519
Mr. Lu.

00:15:46.955 --> 00:15:48.030
What brings you here?

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.960
Mister,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.679
about that Wu Blade

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.320
I gave you before...

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:54.559
Have you changed your mind?

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:55.600
No.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.679
Once I give something away,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.320
I never think about taking it back.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:02.559
I just wanted to tell you

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.879
that this Wu Blade

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.200
was given to me
by someone very important.

00:16:06.879 --> 00:16:08.559
It's basically a token of our love.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.790
Come in and have some tea.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.660
(Yashe)

00:16:26.733 --> 00:16:27.720
Please, have a seat.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:34.240
Mister,

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:37.399
I remember
what happened in Tianguang Market.

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:40.960
I remember him, too.

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:42.960
Mr. Su.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.960
I kidnapped you.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.840
I'm sorry.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.879
And I also know

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.360
that people who leave Tianguang Market

00:16:55.159 --> 00:16:56.759
lose part of their memories.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.120
But the two of you clearly didn't.

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:00.480
Which means

00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:03.919
you're regulars at Tianguang Market.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:06.559
Is that

00:17:06.844 --> 00:17:07.880
a fair assumption?

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.319
There are many
strange places in this world.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.480
Most of them feel unreal.

00:17:13.977 --> 00:17:15.510
It's better to treat it as a dream.

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:16.519
It wasn't a dream.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.279
Lan was real.

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:22.359
Because of her encouragement,

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:23.480
her support,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.799
and her care,

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:27.160
I became who I am today.

00:17:27.244 --> 00:17:29.110
Now that you've gained
both fame and fortune,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.519
why cling to the past?

00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:35.200
Because this isn't the life I want.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.079
The old me...

00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:44.110
was a complete scoundrel.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.640
I've donated all my assets.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.559
I only kept a small studio
in the countryside.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.079
Now I just want to create.

00:17:55.319 --> 00:17:56.359
But I have one wish.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.599
I want to see Lan one more time.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:00.839
Just once.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.079
She's from the past.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.039
You're from the present.

00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:06.440
You can't meet again.

00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:08.240
If you're regulars at Tianguang Market,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.119
then you must
have a way to enter it freely.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.519
I'm begging you.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.279
Please, let me see Lan one last time.

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:18.480
That's impossible.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.519
I just remembered something.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.519
Didn't Lan

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:31.319
also carry a blade

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:32.079
on her?

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:33.240
It looks like the Wu Blade.

00:18:33.355 --> 00:18:34.600
That was the Kun Blade.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.880
Lan's family heirloom.

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:39.039
She gave the blade to me

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.359
as a token of our love.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.440
So that means

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.240
there's a good chance
the Kun Blade is still with Lan.

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:50.640
Do you know her full name?

00:18:50.759 --> 00:18:51.680
Xia Zelan.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.519
Then,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.599
based on what you know about her,

00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:58.440
do you know which dynasty

00:18:58.599 --> 00:18:59.680
she lived in,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.640
and where?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.920
The Qinglong era, Lin'an City,
Guangling Residence.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.599
See?

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.680
This time, the clue the Market Lord gave

00:19:15.866 --> 00:19:17.400
just happens to be missing the owner.

00:19:17.444 --> 00:19:19.160
And the time and place
line up perfectly.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.319
Taking him along won't do any harm.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.960
It might even make things easier.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.759
Mister,

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:28.400
I know neither of you is ordinary.

00:19:28.888 --> 00:19:30.750
You don't want me
knowing too many secrets.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.559
But honestly,

00:19:32.866 --> 00:19:34.240
I'm not interested in any of that.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.440
I just want to see Lan once.

00:19:37.279 --> 00:19:38.119
I know

00:19:38.422 --> 00:19:39.590
you have your concerns.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.440
I can more or less guess
what you're worried about.

00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:44.240
But please trust me.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.160
Just let me see Lan once.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.039
Once is enough.

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.160
I'll be happy just seeing her from afar.

00:19:50.759 --> 00:19:51.480
Besides,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.160
by now,

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.440
she probably

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.240
doesn't remember me either.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:04.720
See,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.200
after Lan left Tianguang Market,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.380
she must've lost her memories.

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:10.480
So things like last time,

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.599
the kidnapping,

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:13.440
or eloping, won't happen again.

00:20:14.222 --> 00:20:15.030
He said it himself.

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.559
He'll just look from afar,

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:17.559
and he won't do anything.

00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:18.960
So nothing will change.

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:21.359
And with his personality,

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:22.759
if we don't take him along,

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:23.680
he won't let this go.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.720
He'll start asking around everywhere.

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:27.640
And who knows,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.839
the whole Tianguang Market

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.000
might end up exposed.

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:32.039
Mister...

00:20:32.066 --> 00:20:33.830
I'm begging you.
Let me see Lan just once.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.160
After that,
that's all I want in this life.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.359
Alright.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.720
I can take you there.

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:48.759
But promise me one thing.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.920
You must not change history.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.160
You must not alter anyone's life path.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.839
And you must leave no trace in the past.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.920
You were never here.

00:20:57.955 --> 00:21:00.111
And afterwards,
you are not to mention this to anyone.

00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:00.640
Okay.

00:21:00.839 --> 00:21:01.680
I understand.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.400
What happens next

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.839
may be beyond anything you know.

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:08.319
Prepare yourself.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240
And understand that

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:13.111
you are nothing more than
a grain of sand in the river of time,

00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:15.119
utterly insignificant.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.359
If I can send you back to the past,

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:19.759
then I can also
make you forget everything,

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.759
and forget Xia Zelan.

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:26.079
When that happens,
you'll truly have nothing left.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.160
I understand.

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:27.960
I get it.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.240
Thank you, Mister.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.359
Su Beilu.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.799
I'll take you somewhere that will
shatter what you think you know.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.880
Let's go.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.720
Listen carefully.

00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:45.480
No matter what happens later,

00:21:45.519 --> 00:21:46.359
do not move.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.029
Otherwise, you'll regret it forever.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.555
The kind of regret you can't undo.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.640
(Back Kitchen of Guangling Residence)

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.480
Order's up.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.559
Coming.

00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:17.559
This heat!

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.559
I dropped an egg yesterday

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.880
right onto the stone slabs
in front of the door.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.680
It started sizzling.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.480
It became half-cooked on the spot.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.839
Tell me about it.

00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:28.279
Forget frying eggs on the road.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.559
Working in this back kitchen
in this weather,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.440
I swear,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.559
I'm basically

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.880
a big steamed bun in a steamer.

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:40.960
Why didn't you add the ice?

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:42.319
It wasn't me.

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:44.160
Then, what do we do now?

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.466
- Deputy Chef.
- Deputy Chef.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.160
What's going on?

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.400
Useless girl.

00:22:53.444 --> 00:22:55.240
We're about to
put the pork tripe in the pot.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.920
We have no time to get more!

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.359
This is Madam's favorite soup.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.920
If the Master blames us,

00:23:00.977 --> 00:23:02.310
can you bear the consequences,

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:03.480
you little fool?

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:07.839
I had a stomachache last night

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.400
and went home early.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.799
Oh?

00:23:11.359 --> 00:23:12.400
Talking back now, are you?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.200
When I have you thrown out

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:16.240
and sold to a brothel,

00:23:16.244 --> 00:23:17.711
let's see how tough you sound then.

00:23:18.279 --> 00:23:19.200
What's going on here?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.640
- Chef Xia.
- Chef Xia.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.960
Chef Xia.

00:23:25.577 --> 00:23:27.960
(Xia Zelan, Chef of Guangling Residence)

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.839
Get back to your work.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.680
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:35.559
Chef Xia,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.160
Cui forgot to add the ice.

00:23:37.311 --> 00:23:38.350
The pork tripe's gone bad.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.377
It can't be used anymore.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.069
Madam ordered pork tripe soup,

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.580
but we couldn't find fresh ingredients.

00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:46.599
Since it's come to this,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.519
blame and excuses won't help.

00:23:49.022 --> 00:23:50.550
We'll have to think of another way.

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:51.480
Yes.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.079
Cui.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.039
Catch a fish.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.079
She's amazing.

00:24:19.119 --> 00:24:20.240
That cut is so clean.

00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:27.759
Her hands are unbelievably steady.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.240
Cui.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.039
You serve it.

00:25:21.444 --> 00:25:22.459
Stop staring.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.910
Don't you have other dishes to make?

00:25:23.911 --> 00:25:24.680
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.079
You stay behind.

00:25:35.733 --> 00:25:37.070
If this was just to save face,

00:25:37.079 --> 00:25:38.119
you really didn't need to.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.559
You can't fool me.

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:41.480
All it does is invite ridicule
from the juniors.

00:25:42.599 --> 00:25:43.519
Chef Xia,

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:45.119
what exactly are you implying here?

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.119
I already told you privately

00:25:48.133 --> 00:25:50.155
that I had to go out yesterday
to restock supplies.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.240
You were the only one
overseeing the back kitchen.

00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:54.200
If you chose not to speak up, fine.

00:25:54.288 --> 00:25:55.866
But why did you have to bully Cui?

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.440
It's her fault
for having a stomachache.

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:00.440
A stomachache?

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:02.680
How did she get a stomach ache?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.720
Because you wouldn't
let her eat on time.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.680
The food had gone bad.

00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:15.279
You're the Deputy Chef.

00:26:15.311 --> 00:26:16.888
One of the old hands in this household.

00:26:16.888 --> 00:26:18.022
Let this be the last time.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:18.960
Understood?

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:20.279
Yes.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.240
Get back to work.

00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:35.759
Hurry and send it to Madam.

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:40.240
What are you standing around for? Go.

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:42.599
Chef Xia,

00:26:43.022 --> 00:26:45.133
Master ordered pork tripe soup.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.000
Now it's suddenly fish soup instead,

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.160
both Master
and Madam might blame us.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.440
Alright.

00:26:55.555 --> 00:26:56.440
I'll send it myself.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:17.920
Sister.

00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:18.599
Have some tea.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.480
Madam, your meal is ready.

00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:26.070
The soup should be taken while it's hot.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.400
Once it cools, it develops a stench,

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.977
which may not suit a pregnant woman.

00:27:29.111 --> 00:27:30.822
(Sun Zhiyun, Madam of Guangling)
Bring it up.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.039
I am still

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:34.240
in mourning.

00:27:34.266 --> 00:27:35.440
It wouldn't be appropriate.

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:37.319
My condolences.

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:39.000
You're pregnant as well.

00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:40.355
I don't mind such formalities.

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:41.599
Come a little closer.

00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:43.039
Yes.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.110
(Sun Zhixuan,
Madam of Guangling's younger sister)

00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:48.119
Let me take a look.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.799
What good stuff
has the kitchen made today?

00:27:57.839 --> 00:27:59.279
That fish soup smells amazing.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.039
I'll taste it for you first,
just in case.

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:03.720
What do you mean?

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:05.160
You just want to have a bite.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.222
With an appetite like that,
how can you slim down?

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.079
Sister!

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:14.240
Absolutely exquisite.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.200
You're truly skilled.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.920
So fresh and delicate.

00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:20.759
I'd drink it even if it were poisoned.

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:23.559
Did you make this soup?

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.759
Yes, Madam.

00:28:24.759 --> 00:28:25.680
I did.

00:28:26.519 --> 00:28:27.440
Sister, have some soup.

00:28:36.133 --> 00:28:37.510
As expected of the Head Chef.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.920
Your cooking is truly exceptional.

00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:42.039
From now on, when you cook,

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.440
send a portion to her as well.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.920
Xuan comes to our residence every summer

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.680
to escape the heat.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.319
Lin'an is scorching this year.

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:52.119
Xuan craves cold foods,

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.880
and her body runs cold.

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:56.599
Unlike me, now that I'm pregnant,

00:28:56.599 --> 00:28:58.240
my body feels overheated all the time.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.680
Make sure the kitchen doesn't
indulge her recklessly.

00:29:02.039 --> 00:29:02.640
Yes.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.720
Sister.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.000
Remember to reward
Chef Xia with some silver.

00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:09.319
Yes.

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:11.240
Your skills are outstanding,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.440
and you're capable and refined.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.480
It's a pity your husband
has just passed.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.319
Such hardships

00:29:17.559 --> 00:29:19.160
are difficult for outsiders to imagine.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.799
For the sake of your unborn child,

00:29:22.039 --> 00:29:23.599
save as much silver as you can.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.119
It'll be useful in the future.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.240
Thank you, Madam.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.359
It's hot.

00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:33.599
Sister, have another iced tea.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.160
Alright.

00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:19.680
What are you doing?

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.400
Take her away.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:21.920
Wait.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.119
Why are you taking me?

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:26.400
Sister!

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:27.200
Get out.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.200
Get out.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.640
Sister!

00:30:31.759 --> 00:30:32.880
My beloved wife.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.510
(Xiao Zhao, Prince of Guangling)
And my child.

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:37.688
(Xiao Zhao, Prince of Guangling)

00:30:38.599 --> 00:30:40.680
How is this happening?

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:43.000
Sister!

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:44.920
Chef Xia has arrived.

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:53.559
You vile woman.

00:30:53.799 --> 00:30:55.079
You killed my beloved wife.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.599
I'll make you pay with your life!

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.720
Madam?

00:30:59.359 --> 00:31:00.440
How did she...

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.000
Master.

00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:05.000
Madam showed me great kindness.

00:31:05.119 --> 00:31:06.799
How could I ever harm her?

00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:08.350
I beg you to seek the truth.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.680
Madam consumed
licorice and carp together.

00:31:10.759 --> 00:31:12.160
These two ingredients conflict.

00:31:12.222 --> 00:31:13.600
In mild cases, it causes poisoning.

00:31:13.644 --> 00:31:14.844
In severe cases, it is fatal.

00:31:14.911 --> 00:31:16.240
Madam was already frail.

00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:18.039
That is why the poisoning took her life.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.160
Licorice?

00:31:19.177 --> 00:31:21.109
Madam recently
suffered from heatstroke.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.930
She had been drinking
licorice tea to recover.

00:31:22.933 --> 00:31:24.680
How could the kitchen not know this?

00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:29.079
No one informed us.

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:33.599
Then, why was it carp soup?

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.759
Why carp soup?

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.279
I clearly ordered pork tripe soup!

00:31:50.822 --> 00:31:52.680
It's true Master
ordered pork tripe soup.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:54.599
Chef Xia changed it to carp soup.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.920
But only because
the pork tripe had spoiled.

00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:00.640
And who caused the pork tripe to spoil?

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.160
All the kitchen maids were there.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.799
They can all testify.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.519
Who switched it to carp soup?

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:10.880
Speak.

00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:14.480
Speak!

00:32:15.022 --> 00:32:15.911
- It was...
- It...

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.440
- It was Chef Xia.
- Chef Xia.

00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:34.119
Master...

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:39.079
So it really was your doing.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.599
Take her away.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.799
Beat her to death.

00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:46.559
Master!

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.559
I've been framed.

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:49.640
Master!

00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:51.759
Framed!

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.079
I've truly been framed!

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.920
Master!

00:32:57.119 --> 00:32:58.519
I'm innocent!

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.440
I really am innocent!

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.880
I swear I've been wronged!

00:33:04.359 --> 00:33:05.240
No!

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:08.799
My child will be born any day now.

00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:09.920
Please, let me go.

00:33:10.319 --> 00:33:11.759
I beg you!

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:13.160
Please, let me go!

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:29.839
So?

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:32.400
This should be mind-blowing enough.

00:33:34.839 --> 00:33:36.000
I was the same the first time.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.160
You'll get used to it.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.359
But remember this.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:39.640
Talk less,

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.599
and be careful.

00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:44.266
People in this era
don't use that gesture.

00:33:44.359 --> 00:33:45.279
Keep it in mind.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.079
Do as you're told, and take advice.

00:33:47.977 --> 00:33:49.550
Let's head to Guangling Residence.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.488
Lan said the Prince of Guangling
holds immense power.

00:34:05.488 --> 00:34:07.044
Looks like she wasn't exaggerating.

00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:08.311
Security must be tight.

00:34:09.039 --> 00:34:10.039
How do we get in?

00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:14.480
What if we hide in this barrel?

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:16.960
It reeks.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.000
This is slop.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:19.199
We won't fit.

00:34:32.333 --> 00:34:34.070
You two look way too practiced at this.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:35.840
Do you do this often?

00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:38.239
How else do you sneak in
without climbing walls?

00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:40.639
And we got lucky today.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.760
We didn't run
into any patrolling guards.

00:34:43.111 --> 00:34:44.311
We're in the back kitchen.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.239
The back kitchen?

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.440
Lan.

00:34:53.622 --> 00:34:54.760
We'll head out first then.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.519
We're off.

00:34:55.519 --> 00:34:56.039
Let's go.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.400
Poor Princess.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.639
Her father died young.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.360
No one's been there to protect her.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.200
Now she has to marry off to some
desolate place as a political bride.

00:35:06.519 --> 00:35:07.000
Yeah.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.777
She's still
her granddaughter, after all.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.440
How could Old Madam bear to do this?

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.110
To avoid the political marriage,

00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:14.088
Princess keeps eating
things that cause rashes.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.511
Her whole body turns red and itchy.

00:35:15.719 --> 00:35:17.320
Old Madam finally found out.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.119
And who do you think got blamed?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Life's only going
to get harder from here.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.600
Even this scented tea
doesn't smell as good as it used to.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.760
You didn't know?

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.639
The tea supplier fell seriously ill.

00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:30.280
This batch comes
from a different grower now.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.400
Let's go.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.679
Was Miss Xia
among those kitchen maids just now?

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.840
The duty roster?

00:35:58.577 --> 00:36:00.580
It's all classical script.
I can't really read it.

00:36:00.639 --> 00:36:01.440
Help me look.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.199
Xia, as in summer.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.079
Ze, as in marsh.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.039
Lan, as in orchid.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.519
She's not here either.

00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:11.440
Are you sure Miss Xia

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.880
was serving in Guangling Residence?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.559
Lan told me herself.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.510
She said she'd settle
in Guangling Residence,

00:36:16.511 --> 00:36:18.070
working her way up
to become a head chef.

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:18.840
It has to be here.

00:36:23.377 --> 00:36:25.511
You even brought the Wu Blade with you.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.488
The Kun Blade and the Wu Blade were
forged from the same piece of dark iron.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.755
They resonate with each other.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.280
Follow me.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.559
I knew Lan would be here.

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:06.679
The Kun Blade is in this lotus pond.
