I could have just ordered

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.900
We ran into Mr. Lin downstairs.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:08.880
He was just standing there,
lost in thought.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.680
He asked us to bring this up to you.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.520
Seems his domestic helper

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.380
made it and sent it over.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.359
Xiguang,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.319
you're in a private room.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.580
I don't think basic insurance

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.320
covers a private room, right?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.820
What are you worried about?

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.240
Mr. Lin already settled
the bill last night.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.640
But honestly,
it's the least he could do.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.720
If his friend
hadn't been screaming like that,

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.800
you wouldn't have been
startled and fallen.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.940
How do you know she was his friend

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.320
and not his girlfriend?

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.900
You didn't see

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.500
how harsh Mr. Lin was with her.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.600
It was actually pretty scary.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.500
The girl was terrified

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.260
when Xiguang fell,

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.080
but if she were his girlfriend,

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.980
he would've comforted her, right?

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.540
Instead, he completely ignored her.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.160
From what I heard,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.880
I think

they were just old classmates.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.500

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.920
I've read your paper

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.200
on brainstem tumors.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.480
Too bad

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.240
when I was there

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.320
for my fellowship,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.080
I heard you'd already resigned.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.680
So, Dr. Lin, where are you

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.440
stationed these days?

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.200
I'm actually not a doctor anymore.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.200
What? Why?

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.280
Everyone has their own path.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.280
Okay.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.580
We can catch up later.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.280
Nie Xiguang, right?

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.360
I'm Dr. Fang,

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.720
your attending physician.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.440
Is your head still hurting?

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.620
A little bit.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.100
It's like

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.760
a throbbing pain.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:35.920
Where exactly?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.860
That's normal.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.100
After all, you fell
from the second floor.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.020
It's impossible to come away from that

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.640
completely unscathed.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.780
It'll take time to recover.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.640
Don't rush it.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.480
Okay.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.880
Judging by your scans,

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.160
there's nothing serious.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.280
However,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.200
it's best to stay in the hospital
for observation for a bit longer.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.580
Get some good rest.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.340
I'll come by

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.440
another time.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.220
Perfect chance for some alone time,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.280
and you just walked out?

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.800
I had no reason to stay.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.120
Are you serious?

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.300
You're never gonna
get the girl like that.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.680
Guess I'm gonna

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.860
play wingman for you.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.540
By the way,

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.920
I actually have a surgery coming up.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.520
It's right up your alley.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.780
Mr. Lin.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.960
You don't have to bring me breakfast.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.520
I actually have something on the way.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.460
It was just an afterthought.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.500
Your attending physician

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.540
is an old classmate of mine.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.740
He has a surgery coming up

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.480
and it's right up my alley.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.740
So he asked me

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.940
to consult on the surgical plan.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.340
Don't you have to work?

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.560
Yesterday, I worked until 3 AM

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.800
and now I'm on my annual leave.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.460
Three point zero
by two point seven centimeters.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.080
It is in a tricky spot.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.540
It's pressing against the brainstem.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.440
Given the size and location,

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.320
I'd still recommend a craniotomy.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.220
It offers a better success rate.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.480
The patient

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.580
is leaning toward Gamma Knife.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.460
I remember

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.500
you have a patient

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.020
with a similar tumor profile?

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.540
That one was even riskier.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.480
I've seen the charts for that case.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.940
Severe facial nerve

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.100
adhesion.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.820
Yet somehow, you saved the hearing.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.740
And no facial paralysis either.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.260
That was incredible work.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.660
There was

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.340
minor facial numbness post-op,

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.760
but it cleared up

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.260
within two weeks.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.520
Dr. Lin, your preservation rate
is insane.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.480
I've only done a few cases.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.140
Not enough for a real statistic.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.540
I'd say luck played a big part.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.300
He really does

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.380
love being a doctor.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.380
That's pure skill.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.640
With more surgeries,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.000
that rate

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.960
will only go up.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:03.720
Dr. Qin

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.820
is being so clueless.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.780
He knows Lin quit,

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.060
but didn't even check why.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.380
How could he say that?

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.600
[Just]

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:36.620
"Just?"

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.780
Just about time for dinner.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.240
How about we all

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:43.960
grab a bite?

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.180
We've been slammed

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.360
with so many tasks lately.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:00.740
Dinner time.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.940
Our patient...

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.020
Join us too.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.340
Me too?

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.140
Yeah.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.100
Since we kind of took over your room,

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:12.820
consider this our payback.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.500
What kind of patient

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.060
ends up having every meal

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.040
with their doctors?

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.500
So, you're saying

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.860
every meal you eat

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.060
is either brought by Mr. Lin,

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.300
or you're eating

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.340
with him,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.160
Dr. Fang, and others?

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.020
Ms. Chen said

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.880
she makes the food for Mr. Lin.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.580
He's here for business anyway,

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.400
so he just had Ms. Chen
make an extra portion for me.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.560
Does that

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.060
even sound logical to you?

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.180
No. That's exactly why

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.800
I asked you over.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.500
Xiguang,

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.280
don't you think

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.720
Mr. Lin

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.540
might actually be into you?

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.060
Seriously?

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:14.960
Try using your head.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.240
If that were the case,

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.600
his emotional wiring

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.020
would be completely out of whack.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.300
How does someone flip a switch

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.560
from "giving me a hard time"

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.440
to "having feelings for me"
just like that?

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:26.740
So,

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.660
it must be that he's actually

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.260
discussing some complex surgery

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.260
with the other doctors.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.140
Plus, he probably feels

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.380
somewhat responsible

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.460
for my fall.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:38.820
Besides, it's not like

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.720
he's the one delivering the food.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.860
Ms. Chen brings it over,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.620
and he just goes downstairs

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.420
and picks it up,

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.940
checks on me for a second,

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.460
and leaves right after.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.080
If he stays...

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.680
it's only to talk shop

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.180
or trade hospital gossip

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.720
with the doctors.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.100
In this room?

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.340
Can you even understand
what they're saying?

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.440
That's why I asked you

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.720
to bring my game console.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.600
Mr. Lin's idea of annual leave

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.380
is truly out of this world.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:14.219
Is he some kind of workaholic?

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.639
It's one thing to pull crazy overtime

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:17.420
at the office,

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.659
but spending his time off in a hospital?

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:21.520
Dr. Fang said

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.860
he's always been so hardcore.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.139
Even back in med school,

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:25.060
he was a total machine.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.679
He was even more of it
once he started at the hospital.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.580
He'd spend a dozen-odd hours in surgery

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.659
and not even break a sweat.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.340
Your attending physician

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.880
has shared quite a lot of gossip

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.120
about Mr. Lin with you, hasn't he?

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.179
Yeah,

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.219
he seems to love chatting with me.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.820
He's actually...

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.920
a bit of a chatterbox.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.840
I really can't imagine

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.260
Mr. Lin as a doctor.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.640
Xiguang,

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.440
has your relationship

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.220
with him improved?

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.480
This is your chance.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.360
Stop being so difficult.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.540
It's alright, I guess.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:10.940
Well...

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.580
Can't bite the hand that feeds me.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.700
We have some normal conversations now.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.080
I think

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.780
the way Mr. Lin treats you

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.480
is a far cry from how he used to.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.380
But...

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.300
why the sudden talk

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.580
about wiping the slate clean?

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.700
Because I'm afraid...

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.560
I'm afraid of seeing patients cry.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:47.660
Yin Jie.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.340
Do I look absolutely terrifying
