WEBVTT

00:49.549 --> 00:51.301
I had my eye on this spot, asshole.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.183
This is my last chance.

01:43.353 --> 01:47.732
Why am I always short on money
when I actually need it?

01:49.567 --> 01:52.987
I go through it all the time,
but it still gets to me.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.438
That's how strong he can be?

03:11.107 --> 03:12.775
Money has no limits, after all.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.781
Damn it.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.769
I love that look your kind always has.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.940
Like you're someone special.

03:55.985 --> 03:56.819
Do you know why?

03:57.320 --> 04:02.492
It makes the look on your face
even more dramatic when you die.

04:21.719 --> 04:22.887
Take it.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.142
Answer the phone.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.578
I'm sure you know this better than anyone,

04:48.329 --> 04:50.456
but money is power, isn't it?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.462
Who are you?

04:57.797 --> 04:59.507
The Chairman of the Mundane Vanguard.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.891
This fight is all about money anyway.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.852
The one with more wins.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.354
Obviously, you're going to lose.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.984
Let's end our fight here.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.572
Why don't you sell me your superpower?

05:40.923 --> 05:43.134
I'll pay whatever price you want.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.719
Think carefully.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.931
In the meantime,
let's call a temporary truce.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.447
Since that day,

06:04.947 --> 06:07.283
the Mundane Vanguard
has been eerily quiet.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.788
MY MIN-SUK

06:14.707 --> 06:15.541
Hey.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.668
TREAT DEBTORS LIKE FAMILY

06:17.752 --> 06:18.878
Are you almost there?

06:19.670 --> 06:21.255
Yes, I'm almost there.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.966
Good. Tell your parents
about the meeting with my family.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.386
Okay.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.554
How's work?

06:30.014 --> 06:32.266
Nothing has been handed over properly.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.062
No system in place.

06:38.815 --> 06:39.857
Will you be okay?

06:40.441 --> 06:44.028
Of course I'm okay. They're paying a lot.
What about you?

06:47.156 --> 06:48.533
Nothing happened, right?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.160
I'm a bit worried.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.745
Of course, nothing happened.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.206
All right. I'll call you back.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.125
-Okay.
-Bye.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.396
NO ENTRY

07:18.479 --> 07:19.856
FORENSICS
FIRE INVESTIGATION

07:25.445 --> 07:27.029
-Organize the evidence…
-Over there!

07:27.113 --> 07:29.240
Please check the pond thoroughly.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.700
-Yes, sir.
-Be careful.

07:30.783 --> 07:31.784
Go deeper.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.619
-What are you doing?
-Pardon?

07:33.703 --> 07:34.871
Aren't you going in?

07:37.874 --> 07:39.250
-Sir, you're here.
-Hey.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.170
-What time is it?
-It's a little before 9:00 a.m.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.339
Don't you need to buy a new one?

07:47.091 --> 07:49.552
It may not look like much,
but it's a family heirloom.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.846
Then you should at least get it repaired.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.223
They don't have the parts anymore.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.865
Mr. Hwang!

08:11.616 --> 08:12.742
Take a look at this.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.536
Gosh.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.331
Look at this.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.415
LOAN AGREEMENT

08:19.499 --> 08:21.000
-"Loan agreement"?
-Yes.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.710
But look at the name here.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.879
Kang Sang…

08:25.379 --> 08:27.131
Does that say "Sang"?

08:27.215 --> 08:31.177
Kim Min-suk from the Cheongdam Hotel fire.
Her husband's name is Kang Sang-ung.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.056
KANG SANG

08:35.640 --> 08:36.516
Getting married?

08:37.016 --> 08:37.850
Yes.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.728
That's great! I'm so happy to hear that!

08:40.811 --> 08:44.065
I was so worried you'd end up living
and dying all alone.

08:44.148 --> 08:44.982
My goodness.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.109
Living alone doesn't kill you.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.779
Min-suk is practically God to me.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.239
My goodness.

08:51.906 --> 08:52.823
What about you, Dad?

08:54.992 --> 08:57.453
-I think--
-Who cares what he thinks?

08:57.537 --> 08:58.371
Congratulations.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.956
Yeah, my opinion doesn't matter.

09:01.958 --> 09:05.920
So I guess we should arrange
a meeting between our families soon.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.088
Definitely.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.131
We're flexible,

09:09.215 --> 09:11.509
so pick a time
that suits your in-laws best.

09:11.592 --> 09:12.885
-Okay?
-Wait.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.721
-Aren't we being a bit too eager?
-Just be quiet!

09:19.892 --> 09:22.770
Then I'll set a date and get in touch.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.689
Goodness. Anyway, I'm so glad.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.982
Jeez.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.817
I'll set the table for you.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.735
-You should eat before you go.
-Okay.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.207
We need to talk.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.545
Jeez.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.052
What is it?
Did I forget to tell you something?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.138
About selling them.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.055
Sell what?

09:58.139 --> 09:59.640
The superpowers.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.226
The Mundane Vanguard
wants me to sell them.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.478
-Sell them?
-Yes.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.355
How do you sell them?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.398
What?

10:07.481 --> 10:08.858
Is that even possible?

10:10.276 --> 10:13.029
-How much are they offering?
-They said they'll pay whatever I want.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.866
Like a superpower is some huge deal.

10:17.950 --> 10:18.951
So?

10:20.036 --> 10:21.120
What will you do?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.414
I don't know. Seriously.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.667
Be careful.

10:27.668 --> 10:28.544
They're scary guys.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.923
They could do you harm, so be careful.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.259
Let me just

10:36.844 --> 10:38.262
get one thing straight.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.724
Do you know

10:42.975 --> 10:45.394
who's caused me the most harm in my life?

10:45.978 --> 10:48.147
Do you know who I trust the least?

10:48.898 --> 10:49.857
Who is it?

10:50.858 --> 10:51.692
Jeez.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.362
Never mind.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.239
Honestly, you have no idea.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.457
They applied,
so we decided to handle the rest.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.541
WELFARE COUNSELING

11:08.125 --> 11:09.418
Please show me your ID too.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.419
Hello.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.296
That's all done for you now.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.965
The funds will be deposited
in your account in a few days.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.592
Dad might be right.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.510
Thank you.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.261
Those guys can't be trusted.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.264
I'm sure they're playing mind games.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.809
-My goodness!
-Wait, that's my place.

11:39.657 --> 11:40.825
ALCOHOLIC ATTORNEY

11:40.908 --> 11:42.410
Should I ask Attorney Byeon?

11:43.285 --> 11:45.538
You're the only one who can stop them.

11:46.831 --> 11:51.127
No. He'll just scold me
for talking nonsense.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.254
Then… Chairwoman Park?

11:53.337 --> 11:54.296
DEBT REPAYMENT AGREEMENT

11:55.297 --> 11:58.342
Including the cost of the test,
the total is 3.005 billion won.

12:02.012 --> 12:02.972
DEBT JEONG-JA

12:10.020 --> 12:11.230
All right, then.

12:13.065 --> 12:17.194
There is only one person left.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.998
Welcome.

12:35.504 --> 12:36.672
I see you're eating.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.175
Then have this after your meal.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.055
They only make 200 of these per day.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.559
During lunch, I stood in line forever
at the department store to get it.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.772
Why would you think I like bread?

12:55.733 --> 12:56.859
If you don't,

12:57.985 --> 12:58.819
I'm sorry.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.031
Then save them
for when you need to fight later.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.450
Carry this huge thing in my pocket?

13:04.533 --> 13:07.244
I mean individually.
There's no way they fit in a pocket.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.419
There's something I'm curious about.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.337
What?

13:18.214 --> 13:20.508
Well, is it possible

13:21.383 --> 13:23.010
to sell our superpowers?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.431
Where did you hear that?

13:28.974 --> 13:29.809
What?

13:29.892 --> 13:32.436
I'm not asking twice. Who told you that?

13:39.860 --> 13:41.070
The Mundane Vanguard.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.907
That's what those bastards said.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.994
That everyone except us had sold them.

13:51.789 --> 13:52.998
What are you saying?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.501
That Attorney Byeon…

13:57.670 --> 13:59.004
knew about everything.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.347
What are we doing here?

14:08.889 --> 14:11.308
You said you were curious
about selling superpowers.

14:12.142 --> 14:15.938
What I'm actually curious about
is if they can really be sold.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.690
And if it's safe.

14:17.773 --> 14:22.194
They can definitely extract superpowers.
They had Hwa-jin's.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.241
Who is Hwa-jin?

14:27.324 --> 14:29.410
Are you going to do it or not?

14:37.501 --> 14:38.335
Fine.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.964
We'll know once we open the safe, right?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.734
BEOMHA GROUP

15:03.277 --> 15:04.528
MISSING SUPERHUMANS LIST

15:11.869 --> 15:13.203
SOLD FOR 400 MILLION WON

15:13.287 --> 15:14.705
PERSUASION HIGHLY UNLIKELY

15:18.208 --> 15:19.960
SUPERPOWER GENE XG-1
DISCOVERY AND INHERITANCE

15:24.006 --> 15:25.966

SOLD FOR 20 MILLION

15:27.384 --> 15:28.928
SOLD FOR 30 MILLION WON

15:31.597 --> 15:34.850
"Even if not bequeathed,
the child inherits at the holder's death."

15:34.934 --> 15:36.185
What is this?

15:36.268 --> 15:39.605
Does it mean it'll get passed down
to my children later on?

15:40.105 --> 15:42.274
Yes, just like any other inheritance.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.947
What kind of inheritance is this?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.283
LEE HWA-JIN

15:54.745 --> 15:57.081
A SUDDEN BURST OF FIRE
AND EXPLOSIVE COMBAT POWER

15:57.164 --> 15:58.666
SOLD FOR ABOUT 80 MILLION WON

16:02.211 --> 16:03.462
I thought she was dead.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.635
Why is

16:11.053 --> 16:12.846
no one reaching out?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.224
They barely made it out of here.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.310
I wouldn't have done it either.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.233
Damn it.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.749
KANG SANG-UNG, 35, CIVIL SERVANT
POWER: STRENGTH, HEALING

16:42.001 --> 16:43.002
WORTH 1.3 BILLION WON

16:45.379 --> 16:47.756
Never allow contact
with the Mundane Vanguard.

16:48.632 --> 16:51.427
Financially unstable and materialistic.
At risk of betrayal.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.706
BYEON HO-IN
DIAGNOSIS: HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA

17:20.789 --> 17:22.708
You must stop drinking immediately.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.752
The prognosis is quite bleak.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.255
Have you spoken to your family about it?

17:34.386 --> 17:35.387
Not yet.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.896
You do not have much time left.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.648
You need to prepare yourself.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.755
BANG EUN-MI

18:20.933 --> 18:22.309
The thing about food is…

18:25.145 --> 18:27.022
that if you eat a lot, you get full.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.692
With alcohol,
if you drink a lot, you get drunk.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.698
Everything has its limits.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.535
But

18:40.702 --> 18:42.204
there's one exception.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.039
Do you know what that is?

18:46.625 --> 18:47.668
It's money.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.089
No matter how much money you have,
it's never enough.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.803
It was too much for you from the start.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.517
The world is overflowing with money.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.603
That also means
that his power is infinite,

19:06.687 --> 19:09.439
and he's becoming aware of it.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.025
So?

19:12.734 --> 19:16.613
I'm saying, even if it costs billions,
it's better to buy it from him.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.116
Dad, it was just an accident.

19:19.199 --> 19:22.286
-Give me a few days. I'll catch him--
-I contacted him in the US.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.833
He's going to fly in next week.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.050
You can at least handle
buying and selling, right?

19:38.260 --> 19:39.511
You should earn your keep.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.396
Thank you for the meal.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.750
Everyone has their own story.

20:10.876 --> 20:14.463
That's why they do
whatever the hell they want.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.468
The same goes for my dad,
Attorney Byeon, Bun-mi,

20:20.135 --> 20:21.303
Chairwoman Park,

20:21.803 --> 20:24.306
and the Mundane Vanguard.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.869
Have you made a decision?

20:48.580 --> 20:49.414
I'll sell it.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.795
How much do you need?

21:00.259 --> 21:01.802
PRIVATE LOAN, MOM'S POOL, DEPOSIT

21:01.885 --> 21:02.970
TOTAL
4,001,650,000 WON

21:07.266 --> 21:08.433
If you're not sure…

21:08.517 --> 21:10.978
-Leave it to me--
-4,001,650,000 won.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.110
Did I ask for too much?

21:19.194 --> 21:20.404
Okay.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.780
I should've asked for more.

21:23.824 --> 21:26.868
I'll let you know the time and place
once they're set.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.925
Min-suk!

21:42.467 --> 21:45.012
Min-suk! I made it!

21:45.512 --> 21:46.513
Thank you.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.976
Hey, Min-suk. Look.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.687
-We just ate.
-Ta-da!

21:55.689 --> 21:57.274
Hey, are you insane?

21:57.357 --> 21:58.734
Why did you buy this?

22:00.027 --> 22:02.779
-What are you, a chaebol?
-I know you wanted to eat it.

22:02.863 --> 22:06.074
We should enjoy
these kinds of luxuries too.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.869
-Here, try it.
-You…

22:08.952 --> 22:10.704
You're nuts. This is so expensive.

22:15.709 --> 22:16.710
What's up with you?

22:17.836 --> 22:19.421
It's so delicious.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.089
Gosh, you must be crazy.

22:21.715 --> 22:22.924
Go ahead and dig in.

22:23.592 --> 22:24.551
Got somewhere to go.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.971
I'm so exhausted.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.225
Where are we?

22:40.484 --> 22:42.069
Where are you taking me?

22:42.652 --> 22:44.279
What's up with you today?

22:46.281 --> 22:48.116
Gosh, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

22:48.909 --> 22:49.910
Let's do this at home.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.620
What are you saying?

22:52.245 --> 22:53.580
Just stay still for a moment.

22:53.663 --> 22:54.998
-Goodness.
-Okay.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.249
-Hold tight.
-What?

23:16.186 --> 23:17.854
-This is nice.
-Stop it.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.532
Are you okay?

23:43.964 --> 23:47.008
Do you know what the stars up there
and these apartments here

23:47.092 --> 23:48.135
have in common?

23:50.720 --> 23:51.847
No idea. What about it?

23:53.140 --> 23:54.224
I'll get both for you.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.479
-Drop it.
-For starters…

23:59.563 --> 24:00.772
I'll get you a star.

24:00.856 --> 24:04.860
I have some money now,
so the height from here to there must be…

24:05.360 --> 24:06.570
-No.
-All right.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.613
-Sang-ung, I said no.
-One.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.450
Stop it. Sang-ung, I'm serious.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.285
-What's with you today?
-Let go.

24:13.368 --> 24:14.661
-Two.
-That's really high.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.580
-You could actually die.
-Three!

24:52.449 --> 24:55.243
I forgot to give you the ring
when I proposed.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.220
It's pretty.

25:13.803 --> 25:14.763
Do you like it?

25:21.144 --> 25:22.646
-You…
-What?

25:23.897 --> 25:25.398
What's going on?

25:26.274 --> 25:27.484
It's okay. Just tell me.

25:29.319 --> 25:31.029
I think things will work out.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.660
We're finally done with all the hardship.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.788
It's time to get my act together too.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.456
Hey.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.084
You're scaring me. What's going on?

25:45.210 --> 25:46.586
I'm going to be a new person.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.840
What is it? What exactly is going on?

25:53.677 --> 25:55.720
Once it's all sorted out, I'll tell you.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.767
Are you curious?

26:03.103 --> 26:04.312
I'll let it go just for today.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.358
It's so pretty.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.410
That superpower comes in handy sometimes.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.580
Indeed.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.500
Since I gained my superpowers,

26:26.001 --> 26:28.962
this was the first time I felt at peace.

-Hi, good morning.
-Hello.

27:14.090 --> 27:15.342
Hello, good morning.

27:23.850 --> 27:24.684
It's heavy.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.646
Thank you.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.318
You've come to your senses.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.279
I decided to become a new person,
starting today.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.455
The kind civil servant has returned.

27:45.538 --> 27:46.998
KINDEST EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH

27:52.837 --> 27:53.672
Hello.

27:54.839 --> 27:55.924
Can I register my move?

27:56.007 --> 27:57.967
-Have you filled out the forms?
-Yes.

27:58.718 --> 27:59.552
Here.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.098
JO NATHAN

28:03.181 --> 28:05.684
Wow, you have a great name.

28:06.434 --> 28:07.477
Mr. Jo Nathan.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.230
NAME: JO NATHAN

28:10.313 --> 28:12.273
Don't you have a previous address?

28:13.066 --> 28:14.901
I just got here from the US.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.820
I see.

28:17.737 --> 28:18.780
From the US…

28:18.863 --> 28:20.824
I admire the way you work for others

28:21.533 --> 28:24.160
even without recognition.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.498
That's the kind of hero the world needs.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.294
Excuse me?

28:36.423 --> 28:37.257
The thing is,

28:38.466 --> 28:41.136
I'm also working quietly
to make a difference.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.982
As a civil servant
of the Republic of Korea.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.905
So you're a civil servant.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.199
Gosh, I thought… Jeez.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.326
Must be going through a lot.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.245
Not at all.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.251
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

29:13.752 --> 29:16.921
Something happened?
The police are outside looking for you.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.633
CHANGIL-DONG ADMINISTRATIVE WELFARE CENTER

29:22.469 --> 29:23.845
-You two, back door.
-Yes, sir.

29:27.223 --> 29:29.768
Since I'm innocent,
should I just walk out confidently?

29:29.851 --> 29:31.060
No.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.564
What if things go wrong
and I end up getting arrested?

29:35.356 --> 29:38.026
I must sell my superpower no matter what.

29:38.526 --> 29:39.861
Then no evidence is left.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.324
I'm really sorry, but could you
finish up his registration?

29:44.407 --> 29:47.285
I need to step out for something urgent
outside the office.

29:49.037 --> 29:49.871
Mr. Kang.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.080
Goodbye.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.167
Mr. Kang Sang-ung must be…

29:54.250 --> 29:55.293
-Mr. Kang!
-Be quiet!

29:59.380 --> 30:00.715
Oh dear.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.595
-He's fleeing toward the back door.
-God.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.598
Damn it.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.358
Hey. Are you okay?

30:18.441 --> 30:21.027
-Hey, let me borrow the car.
-Where are you going? Hey!

30:45.510 --> 30:46.553
Yes?

30:47.136 --> 30:50.598
I'm really sorry,
but I'm in a hurry right now.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.183
Do you mind if I sell it today?

30:53.768 --> 30:54.602
Today?

30:55.520 --> 31:00.859

What is he doing?

BEOMHA RANCH

31:38.521 --> 31:39.647
Kang Sang-ung.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.612
You startled me.

31:55.371 --> 31:58.249
-Not at work at this hour?
-I'm working off-site.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.836
What about you, Mr. Attorney?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.797
Why aren't you at your office
at this hour?

32:07.175 --> 32:08.343
It's under construction.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.720
Someone broke into the office.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.306
I see.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.356
Are you carrying cash?

32:22.106 --> 32:23.274
Have you had any alcohol?

32:28.613 --> 32:29.864
SOJU

32:44.420 --> 32:45.964
What the hell are they doing?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.176
Please.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.638
-Move. You'll get hurt.
-That's not something you sell.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.056
Says who?

32:55.139 --> 32:56.724
It's up to the seller.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.850
How could you do this to me?

33:39.684 --> 33:42.270
You knew everything.
Why did you pretend you didn't?

33:42.353 --> 33:43.938
You don't need to know everything.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.441
-Why not?
-Because you'll be tempted.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.446
What's it to you if I'm tempted?

33:59.287 --> 34:00.538
BEOMHA RANCH

34:06.002 --> 34:07.628
This is good.

34:08.504 --> 34:09.338
That's a relief.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.719
Damn it.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.181
What the…

35:14.737 --> 35:16.114
Gosh.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.534
Jeez.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.996
He can't be serious.

35:43.516 --> 35:44.684
Fuck!

35:49.772 --> 35:50.982
Seriously.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.318
Hey! Why are you attacking me?

35:55.611 --> 35:56.445
Stop it!

35:57.405 --> 35:58.447
Stop it!

36:02.034 --> 36:02.910
Gosh.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.509
Come on!

36:24.348 --> 36:25.933
You're at Beomha Ranch?

36:26.726 --> 36:27.560
Yes, ma'am.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.313
Stop him from getting in.

Let's stop this.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.429
Their plan is
to make us fight amongst ourselves.

37:04.013 --> 37:07.516
The lie about superpowers
not being for sale was part of their plan?

37:07.600 --> 37:08.809
That makes no sense!

37:08.893 --> 37:10.478
That was all for your sake!

37:10.561 --> 37:12.813
Why are you acting like a child?

37:13.606 --> 37:14.440
Jeez!

37:15.691 --> 37:17.235
You're always like that.

37:17.318 --> 37:20.488
You're always the right and righteous one,
but it's all about you!

37:20.571 --> 37:22.073
You're such a boomer, damn it!

37:24.951 --> 37:26.327
What? What now?

37:28.537 --> 37:31.249
Bun-mi, I told you to control your anger.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.125
That's enough.

37:33.209 --> 37:36.796
Seeing others sell their superpowers
and thrive must've driven you mad.

37:36.879 --> 37:39.590
-Because you never get a call!
-I did!

37:43.010 --> 37:44.053
You're lying.

37:44.136 --> 37:45.888
You're lying again!

37:47.473 --> 37:49.517
You only lie to me and no one else!

37:49.600 --> 37:51.477
Sir, that bastard is getting away.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.520
Hey, stop him.

37:54.647 --> 37:55.773
Go. Step on it!

38:10.871 --> 38:12.748
Hey, mister!

38:18.045 --> 38:18.921
What happened?

38:19.005 --> 38:21.132
What the hell? Looks like he got away.

The money…

40:32.680 --> 40:34.598
Right, the money.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.350
Of course.

40:37.601 --> 40:38.727
Bring it.

I thought you had some integrity,

for a bit of money.
