(Two Years Ago)

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:49.560
Good boy.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.599
It'll be done soon.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.719
Hold it steady, Chun Ge.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:52.200
Come on.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.280
Stretch your leg out.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:57.840
Disinfect it.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.980
It hasn't been disinfected.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.079
You do it.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.000
Let's switch places.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.760
Hold it. Here.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.040
- Don't move, Eddie.
- I'll do it.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.080
Who are you?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.080
I'm a nurse.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:13.479
What's its name?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.199
Eddie.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840
Eddie.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.400
Good boy, Eddie.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.639
Sweetheart.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.400
Needle.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.080
Hold it.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.690
Be good, Eddie. Don't move.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.960
It'll be done soon.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.879
Don't look.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.159
Relax.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.080
All done.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.599
Done.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.479
It's drawn?

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.240
Hold this.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.439
It doesn't hurt now, Eddie.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:36.360
Thanks.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.240
Are you

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.199
today's

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.120
new nurse?

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.439
I'm Ren Xiaomin.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.879
I'm Su Beilu.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.240
He's Chun Ge.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.639
We've been at Chongle for a year.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.120
If you have any questions,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.879
just ask us.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.000
Hello, everyone.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.120
My name is Ren Xiaomin.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.240
Let's work together from today on.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.360
As a veterinarian,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.439
I'll protect

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.960
every furry kid's health.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.039
Well said.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.439
Don't just say it's well said.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.960
Learn properly from her.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.520
Alright.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.780
Meeting adjourned. Get to work.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.240
I wasn't late today.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.439
This place doesn't look great,

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.680
but it tastes amazing.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.599
Especially this burger.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.599
Eat it while it's hot.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.599
I think it's good.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.599
Nothing's wrong with it.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.280
The roast chicken's good too.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.120
Wait.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.800
Let me take a photo first.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.439
Go ahead.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.400
It's to mark our first meal together.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.280
Let's take a selfie.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.960
Sure.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.479
Come on.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.000
One, two, three.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.039
Let me see.

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.039
Did I close my eyes?

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.800
No.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.800
I'll make a group chat. Send it there.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.520
Sure.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.560
By the way, what is
the group chat called?

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.639
It's called

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.960
Survived Another Dog Day.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.159
That's good.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.400
Then the group chat is called

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.479
- Survived Another Dog Day.
- Survived Another Dog Day.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.400
- Woof.
- Woof.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.879
Okay, no problem.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.420
(Year 2024)

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.840
Made it.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:10.879
Morning, Sir.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.039
What time is it?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.919
30 seconds past nine.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.360
Let me clock in.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.040
What 30 seconds?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.280
Not even one second is allowed.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.839
Alright.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.790
Third time this month.
You finished your quota.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.260
You'll get fined if you're late again.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:27.199
Sir, just let me clock in.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:27.720
Clock in?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.800
I'd clock you instead.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.199
Did you plan this with Su Beilu?

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.450
You're taking turns to annoy me.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.040
Morning, Sir.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.120
Learn from Xiaomin.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.720
Were you late again?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.959
Come earlier next time.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.000
Why are you so late?

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.079
(Survived Another Dog Day)
(Su Beilu isn't around this year.)

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:13.839
(Is tomorrow's badminton match doomed?)

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.519
(Let that fat jerk regret it.)

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.240
(He fired a great employee like me.)

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.279
(Who's competing this year?)

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.720
(The buff Sailor Moon,)

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.000
(Me, Xiaomin.)

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920
(Don't worry.)

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.920
(We'll fight for good results.)

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.480
Get high!

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.639
Chongle.

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.079
Great performance.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.560
Chongle.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.160
Sports are joy.

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.720
Shout.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.800
Louder, come on.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.800
- Chongle.
- Chongle.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.350
- Great performance.
- Great performance.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.639
- Chongle.
- Chongle.

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.240
- Sports are joy.
- Sports are joy.

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:00.639
Get out.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.040
Or you're disqualified.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.560
It's fine, relax.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.199
Play your best.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.480
Your results affect your bonus.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240
Well...

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.000
Good luck!

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.120
Good luck.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.199
Ignore him.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:13.720
It's fine.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:14.240
Good luck.

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.839
Good luck.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:15.199
Relax.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.600
Players, please take the court.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:18.439
Give it your best.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.879
It's fine.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.199
Match starts.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.399
They might be nervous at first.

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:35.079
That's normal.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.839
Normal.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.879
Was that out?

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:45.240
Referee.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.120
That shot.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.079
It's fine, you couldn't see.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:48.890
It might have been...

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.199
Give it your best!

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:57.399
Yes, play like that.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.790
- Give it your best.
- That's it.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.399
What's wrong?

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.120
Did you twist your ankle?

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:16.600
Are you okay? Let me see.

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:17.639
An old injury.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.820
It's always like this. I'm fine.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:19.680
Let me rest a bit.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.959
How are you?

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:24.720
Can you stand?

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:26.240
Why are you here?

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:26.800
Well...

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:27.519
Well...

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.120
I mean,

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.560
we can call a substitute.

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:31.319
A secret weapon.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.120
Chun Ge, stop playing.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.000
Go rest for a bit.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.850
The match isn't over.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.639
How can I rest?

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.399
Leave it to me.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.199
Go.

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:38.000
Go.

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:39.920
Come on.

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:41.000
Leave it to me.

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.390
I'm fine.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.910
No substitute needed. I can still play.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.160
- Play?
- Play?

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.040
- Your ankle's twisted.
- Exactly. Sit down.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.600
Lingering injury would be troublesome.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.399
- I'm really fine.
- Stop being stubborn.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.160
Sit down.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.839
Go ask if we can have a substitution.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:54.720
Referee!

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:55.600
Substitution.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.240
His ankle...

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.120
Go back.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.279
Sorry.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.199
Substitution approved.

00:07:59.199 --> 00:07:59.759
Okay.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.759
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:01.990
Players, please take the court.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.580
Good luck.

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:04.560
Spray it.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.040
Ice pack.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.879
It's a little cold.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.639
Careful.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:07.040
Go.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.240
It's fine.

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:09.160
Watch for a bit.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:19.720
Nice.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:20.250
Well played.

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:20.800
Great shot.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.480
Not bad.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.800
Pretty good.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.720
Great shot.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.200
Sorry.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.039
I didn't mean it.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.159
Press it yourself.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.390
I'll watch the match for a bit.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.000
Su Beilu

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.159
left the clinic. Why can he represent?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.679
We said before

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:49.039
that he can play
within six months after leaving.

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:50.240
I asked him to come.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.919
It's not over.

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:03.919
Keep going.

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:04.799
Hurry.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.000
This kid has the flair
I had back in the day.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Of course.

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:44.519
Feeling better?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.759
Chun Ge.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:46.960
Is your foot okay now?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.759
Really?

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:51.799
I'm okay.

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:52.759
Look.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080
I can stand.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.720
Let's eat together tonight.

00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:58.440
We'll celebrate today's win.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.559
Sichuan boiled fish.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.879
There's a new place by the plaza.

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:03.039
Let's eat that.

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:03.480
Okay.

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:05.159
I don't eat fish.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.360
I forgot.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.080
Then...

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.240
Lamb pot?

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.799
I don't eat that either.

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:14.639
Chun Ge.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.320
Didn't you eat lamb skewers?

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:17.080
Yeah.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.200
I eat grilled ones,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.679
but not lamb pot.

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.039
My mom said

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.000
it's too heaty,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.159
so she doesn't let me eat it.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.559
You're really not going?

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:28.080
Xiaomin has special plans today.

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:32.440
Chun Ge is injured.

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.399
Don't push him.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:34.720
Rest well, Chun Ge.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.639
You really not going?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.080
It's fine.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.360
You go without me.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.200
Don't worry about me.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:43.320
Go on.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.159
Go on.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.320
Don't worry about me. Really.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.240
My mom cooked for me.

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:52.120
Rest well then.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.990
Don't forget
to apply ointment on your foot.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.559
We're off.

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:57.480
Bye.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.159
Bye.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:58.799
Bye.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:01.840
So

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.990
Sichuan boiled fish then.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.720
Okay.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720
Lamb pot is good too.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.559
No.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.780
The newly opened fish restaurant
is offering discounts.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.380
We'll get 50 back for spending 100.
And 100 back for spending 200.

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:30.639
We need you.

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:33.180
(You haven't logged into
Magic Sword Cangqiong for three days.)

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.240
(The wuxia world is waiting
for you to protect it.)

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.279
(Junior Brother.)

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:49.519
(You're slacking again.)

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.919
(Senior Sister.)

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.039
(I'm not.)

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:54.919
(No matter how much I train,)

00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:57.279
(I can't reach
Sword Immortal Bai Qiongyu.)

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.519
(Don't say that.)

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.519
(To me,)

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:02.240
(you are Cangqiong Sect's hope.)

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.879
I succeeded.

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:22.240
Alright.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.960
One more.

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:25.200
Son.

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.519
Dinner's ready.

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:27.600
Come eat.

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:29.360
Son...

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.840
Stop playing.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.200
- The sea cucumber porridge is ready.
- Mom, wait.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.240
Eat it while it's hot.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.799
No, Mom.

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.679
I said no.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.240
I won't drink it.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.039
Go out and eat.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:50.080
Dad.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.759
Can I skip it?

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:54.200
Go out and drink it now.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.799
Dad.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.399
I've had this porridge all my life.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.639
I never missed a meal.

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:01.919
I'm sick of it.

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:03.639
I don't want it anymore, okay?

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:06.039
Your mom cooks for over an hour daily.

00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:06.860
Is that easy for her?

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:08.480
Can't you appreciate her effort?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.720
You're tired
of the sea cucumber porridge?

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.240
That's because you were weak as a kid.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.399
It was for your health.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:14.879
Look at you now.

00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:16.519
You just play games when you're home.

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:18.320
Or you play with your junk.

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:19.600
What else can you do?

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.000
Now you won't even eat properly.

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:22.360
You're useless.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.159
What are you doing?

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:26.360
Yes.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.279
I'm useless.

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:32.840
In your eyes,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.600
haven't I always been useless?

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:38.960
I'm weak.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.600
But I don't want to be!

00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:44.960
I see them play on the court.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.159
Do you think I'm not jealous?

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:47.919
I want to join them too.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.000
Why must I be a wallflower?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.440
I don't want that!

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:53.320
What's wrong with games?

00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:55.480
What's wrong with figurines?

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.679
They're my hobbies.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.039
Why...

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:01.600
Why can't you respect me a bit?

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:03.759
I'm already an adult.

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:04.320
Dad.

00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:05.360
I don't even

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.840
have

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.799
the right to skip a meal
once in a while.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.679
Why is it like this?

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:19.600
Dad.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.440
I really don't understand.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:29.190
I don't want this anymore.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480
I've had enough.

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:31.600
Son.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.720
What are you doing?

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:35.399
Son.

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:36.360
Son.

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:37.519
Stop chasing him.

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:38.399
Let him go.

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:40.279
Dad didn't mean that, Son.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.440
Let's eat.

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:43.759
What are you doing?

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:45.519
He hasn't eaten yet.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.660
Whether he eats is up to him.

00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:50.360
Come on, follow me.

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:51.639
Take this.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.820
(Yashe)

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:39.559
Good evening, Boss.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.360
Sorry to bother you.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.159
Chun Ge?

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.260
Are you looking for Su Beilu?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.399
He's off work already.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:48.240
No.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.840
I'm not...

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:52.480
Is it closing time?

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:54.000
Then I won't disturb you.

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:55.039
It's fine.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.759
What's wrong?

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:00.440
You look troubled.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.919
What is it?

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.919
No, I just

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.360
passed by.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.990
I came in to take a look
since I'm already here.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.679
What's wrong with your leg?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:10.840
Are you hurt?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.799
I twisted it playing badminton.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.759
It's fine.

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:16.320
It's fine.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:16.879
Really.

00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:19.519
Seems things aren't going well.

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:22.360
Anything I can help with?

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:27.480
It's nothing.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:29.799
I see.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.039
Come with me.

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:37.120
I have a daybed here.

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:38.919
You can rest here.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.559
Think about life.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.120
I've heard a saying.

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:46.279
No matter how big the trouble,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.440
sleep it off.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.080
After you wake up,

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.440
it might be solved.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.759
Boss, don't bother.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.879
I'll just sit for a bit.

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:54.750
Make yourself at home.

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.159
Thanks, Boss.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.240
You're welcome.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.079
An ancient pillow?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.079
It's so hard.

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:27.079
Can anyone sleep on this?

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.680
Sleeping like this must have been
torture to ancient people.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.200
Can you even fall asleep like this?

00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:17.519
Where am I?

00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:20.960
Lanfeng Pavilion?

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.319
I can see clearly now.

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:24.079
You're awake.

00:18:35.519 --> 00:18:36.839
Boss.

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:39.880
Why are you cosplaying?

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.119
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:46.359
Why am I dressed like this?

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.960
My hair is long too.

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:51.240
Disciple of Cangqiong Sect, listen up.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.640
Cangqiong Sect?

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.839
Magic Sword Cangqiong?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.279
I'm inside the game world?

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.119
You fell off a cliff.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.519
To save your life,

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.359
I transferred my inner power to you.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.920
You transferred

00:19:09.079 --> 00:19:10.519
your inner power to me?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.640
Boss, stop joking.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.290
I barely have strength
to play badminton.

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:16.960
How would I have inner power?

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:33.359
I shattered this?

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.880
More precisely,

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:37.440
you shattered it with my inner power.

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:46.559
Boss, no.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.480
That's too big.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:47.920
Quick.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.640
Put it down.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.119
Boss. Listen to me. Put it down.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.160
Try it.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.359
(Chun Ge,
Combat Power)

00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:39.839
I can use martial arts now?

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.480
I've become stronger.

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:47.559
I'm really stronger.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.240
This feels amazing.

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:53.960
Wait.

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:57.119
If I'm a Cangqiong Sect disciple,

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.480
then you're Sword Immortal Bai Qiongyu.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.279
Sword Immortal.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.000
Sword Immortal.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.200
Sword Immortal!

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:25.079
Only the benevolent are invincible.

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:27.839
(Sword Immortal's Sword)
Only the brave are fearless.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.519
Use this inner power
for something meaningful.

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:34.559
Do not betray my trust.

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.960
It really is Sword Immortal Bai Qiongyu.

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:45.480
Cangqiong Sect.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.599
This entrance looks grander
than in the game.

00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:00.799
Wait.

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:03.200
Where are they all going?

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.079
Get lost.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.680
What's with that attitude?

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:08.000
Bro.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.279
Can you tell me what's happening?

00:22:10.279 --> 00:22:11.240
Even if I told you,

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.240
what could you do?

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.160
Stop causing trouble.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:13.960
Exactly.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.319
They treat me the same in the game.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.820
(Tang Yansheng,
Cangqiong Sect Leader)

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.960
Dr. Tang?

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.240
What nonsense are you saying?

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.090
Where's the physician?

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.140
(Min
Cangqiong Sect Senior Sister)

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.960
Xiaomin?

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:48.960
You're here too?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.920
Of course I am.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.820
You, on the other hand,

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.460
I told you to fetch a physician
for three days. Where are they now?

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.440
I don't know.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.400
Min, don't blame him.

00:22:57.519 --> 00:22:58.400
Father.

00:22:58.559 --> 00:22:59.720
Father.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.599
He became your father?

00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:02.799
He's your master.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.000
Now he's my master too?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.039
Did you lose your memory,
or are you playing dumb?

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.000
He was injured a few days ago
by Long Zhentian, head of Tianlong Cult.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.119
He's badly hurt now.

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:11.920
Yet you couldn't even find a physician.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.000
Head of Tianlong Cult?

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.799
I haven't played that part yet.

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:19.599
Chun is back.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.920
Su Beilu?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.390
- Senior Brother.
- Senior Brother.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.160
Senior Brother.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.600
Su Beilu, you're Senior Brother now?

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.900
(Su Beilu,
Senior Brother of Cangqiong Sect)

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:31.400
Impressive.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.440
What are you doing?

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.390
This is your Senior Brother,
call him Senior Brother Su.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.519
There's no time to explain.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.680
Bao Wuji of the Tianlong Cult
is attacking.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.400
- He's at the mountain entrance.
- What?

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.759
Bao Wuji?

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.720
How could this be?

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:43.839
Father.

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:48.279
Bao Wuji has mastered
Tianlong Cult's Purple Toad Skill.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.359
You're no match for him.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.599
I'll go fight him myself.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.400
Father.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.799
Don't go.

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.319
It's too dangerous for you.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.319
Don't go.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.079
Master.

00:23:58.079 --> 00:23:59.200
Rest and recover.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.279
Don't hurt yourself again.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.079
I request to lead the disciples
to face the enemy.

00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:04.960
Go ahead.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.440
Yes.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.440
Chun.

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:07.119
Min.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.240
Take good care of Master.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.720
The rest of you, follow me.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.519
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.200
This...

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:15.839
Senior Brother Su. I'll go with you.

00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:16.319
No.

00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:17.660
I'm going too.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.220
(Bao Wuji
Tianlong Cult Protector)

00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:39.799
Bao Wuji.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.000
Our sect has no grudge
against Tianlong Cult.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.599
Besides, we've always kept to ourselves.

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:44.880
Why are you so relentless?

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.839
Why?

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.359
Recently,

00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:48.319
Cangqiong Sect

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:50.680
have secretly allied with other sects,

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:52.559
planning to unite against Tianlong Cult.

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:54.039
Do you think we didn't know?

00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:56.079
Your leader Long Zhentian
injured my master,

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.799
and now you come here with your people.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.799
You repeatedly provoked us.

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:00.599
Why is that?

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.240
You were unjust first.

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:04.680
Don't blame me for being unrighteous.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.039
Sir?

00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:12.480
Chun? Weren't you supposed
to take care of Master?

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.520
Why are you adding trouble?

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.799
It really is you.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:19.119
But what's with that outfit

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.000
And your eyes

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.680
and hair.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.559
It's ridiculous.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.480
Why are you also a villain here?

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.079
Silence.

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:28.880
Where did this brat come from?

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.880
How dare you act
so presumptuously in front of me?

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.279
Watch me...

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:34.079
I've long been annoyed by you.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.279
You flaunt your power
in front of us every day,

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.839
making us clock in.

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:39.680
Clock in.

00:25:39.759 --> 00:25:40.359
Clock in?

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.480
What?

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.079
I should be clocking you.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.960
That's what you said outside!

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:46.359
Attack!

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.359
Don't come closer!

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:12.160
Chun.

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:13.960
When did you master such inner power?

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.279
Don't ask.

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:17.119
I just learned it.

00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:18.960
You've gone too far.

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:20.519
Forcing me to make a move?

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.200
Junior Brother, step back.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.160
You can't beat him.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.200
Disciples.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.720
Beware of his Purple Toad Skill.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.200
Today I was careless.

00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:16.680
Just you wait.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.480
I will return!

00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:20.240
Retreat!

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:27.279
Hold on.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.390
Don't chase a fleeing enemy.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.920
I'll hit you every time you come.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.359
Amazing, Chun Ge.

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:32.519
When did you get this strong?

00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:33.359
Yes.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.400
I didn't even see that move clearly.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.519
Exactly, Chun.

00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:38.279
How did you even do it?

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.640
Chun.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.240
Thank you for helping.

00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:43.359
No.

00:27:43.839 --> 00:27:44.960
More precisely,

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:45.960
you turned the tide.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.519
You exaggerated.

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:50.039
I...

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.519
I just thought

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.160
they shouldn't be
making a move at our entrance.

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:55.279
Besides,

00:27:55.519 --> 00:27:56.799
they injured Senior Brother,

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.440
and Xiaomin was next.

00:27:58.759 --> 00:28:00.279
I couldn't allow that.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.799
But you can't just
put yourself in front of me either.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.279
What if you got hurt?

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:06.400
I will never let them touch you.

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:11.079
In fact,

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.240
not only did you not lose,

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:14.470
- Sect Leader.
- Sect Leader.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.839
but you actually won.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.599
And you did so with great honor.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:19.960
Chun, come.

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:24.200
Chun.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.200
I underestimated you.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.240
I didn't expect you
to be such a martial prodigy.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.960
You secretly mastered
such profound inner power.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.880
Tell me

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:37.960
how you

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:39.559
master this inner power?

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:40.960
Share a bit

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.240
with your fellow disciples.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.119
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:28:43.119 --> 00:28:44.130
- Share it.
- Share it.

00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:46.920
Actually, I...

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.839
I

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.920
haven't really trained much.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.039
You're too modest.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.039
Teach us when you're free.

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:57.680
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.000
- Teach us.
- Teach us.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.079
Alright.

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:02.000
Winning this battle

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:04.680
and defending the sect's honor are good.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.559
As for the process...

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.440
You should all learn from Chun Ge.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.359
Train in private

00:29:11.359 --> 00:29:12.720
and do it diligently.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.119
One day,

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:17.279
you too will have your moment like him.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:18.640
- Master.
- Master.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.359
Yes.

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:20.359
Master.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.319
How about you head back and rest first?

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.000
Alright.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.240
Disperse.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.200
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.519
Chun.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:27.759
Come with me.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.160
I have an important task for you.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.000
Recently,

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.319
Tianlong Cult has been
causing trouble repeatedly.

00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:45.799
The Five Great Sects

00:29:45.799 --> 00:29:47.039
are also greatly disturbed.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.200
I

00:29:48.759 --> 00:29:50.400
have secretly negotiated multiple times

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:52.319
with the other sect leaders,

00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:53.960
preparing to form an alliance

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:56.119
to resist Tianlong Cult together.

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:00.000
So that Bao guy

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.480
was telling the truth.

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:06.079
Actually, tomorrow

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.799
I have already arranged

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.759
to meet with the leaders
of all major sects

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.400
at Zongyu Mountain of Langya Sect

00:30:12.519 --> 00:30:15.240
to discuss attacking Tianlong Cult.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.880
But with my current health...

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.400
Chun.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.240
Could you

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:25.519
represent Cangqiong Sect

00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:27.200
and attend the meeting in my place?

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.839
Me?

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:35.519
Master.

00:30:35.519 --> 00:30:37.160
Don't kid me.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.799
I think

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.759
something this important

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.160
would be more suitable
for Senior Brother.

00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:47.279
No.

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:47.920
Master.

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:49.440
I'm serious.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.480
Think about it.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480
I'm just a nobody.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.160
If I go there,

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.680
no one will listen to me.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.799
They don't care about me.

00:30:55.759 --> 00:30:57.720
And if I say the wrong thing,

00:30:58.079 --> 00:30:59.559
I could embarrass our sect.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.240
Right?

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.400
Master, you...

00:31:01.599 --> 00:31:02.680
You should reconsider.

00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:04.759
Who said you're a nobody?

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.400
Chun.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.559
Kneel.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:28.640
I, Tang Yansheng,
third leader of Cangqiong Sect,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.160
appoint Chun Ge, fourth-generation
disciple of Cangqiong Sect,

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:33.440
to temporarily assume

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.000
the position of Sect Leader.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:36.839
Chun Ge.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.400
Receive the leader's seal.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.759
This way,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.480
no one will underestimate you
as the acting sect leader.

00:31:43.839 --> 00:31:45.119
You can now

00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:47.440
legitimately attend the meeting.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.319
Master.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.039
This seems even less appropriate.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.960
Senior Brother should be the one
inheriting the sect leader's seal.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:53.519
No,

00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:55.200
you are.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.680
Master once said

00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:03.079
whoever first masters
the ten-level inner power technique

00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:06.279
will inherit the sect leader position.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.000
Your inner power

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.440
is clearly above mine.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.000
This seal

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.799
rightfully belongs to you.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.240
I won't make the wrong judgment.

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:20.640
Take the seal.

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:24.440
Master, I...

00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:26.799
Chun.

00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:29.440
Please take the seal.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.620
(Cangqiong Sect Seal,
Prestige)

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.279
Sorry.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.319
I admit

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.960
I was a bit harsh before.

00:32:58.279 --> 00:32:59.359
I didn't expect

00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:00.559
you would improve so quickly.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.559
What?

00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:05.580
You're not happy being the sect leader?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.279
No.

00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:09.440
Master wants me to represent our sect

00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:11.039
and attend some…

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.880
Five Great Sects' secret meeting.

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:17.519
Isn't that a good thing?

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:18.759
You don't want to go?

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.799
Not exactly.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.160
Look.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.690
I don't understand martial world rules.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.839
I don't even know the names

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:27.000
of those sects.

00:33:27.559 --> 00:33:29.119
Thinking about it makes me more nervous.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.960
When I was little and went with Father

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.839
to martial arts tournaments,
I felt the same.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.839
I was nervous.

00:33:35.839 --> 00:33:36.839
But don't worry,

00:33:37.359 --> 00:33:38.519
the sect leaders

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:40.319
are all loyal and righteous.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.100
They won't
make things difficult for you.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.039
How about this?

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.960
Aren't you worried?

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.400
I'll go with you tomorrow.

00:33:52.279 --> 00:33:53.039
Really?

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.839
I'm already familiar with it anyway.

00:33:56.119 --> 00:33:58.400
Besides, I've met those sect leaders
a few times.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.559
With me introducing you,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.240
it will indeed be safer.

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:03.599
Then,

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:04.960
it's settled.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.920
Thank you so much.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.480
Why are you so polite?

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:10.239
Sect Leader

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:12.000
Chun.

00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:14.990
Rest early. See you tomorrow.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.199
See you tomorrow.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.140
(Intimacy)

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.220
(Zongyu Mountain)

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.639
We're approaching Zongyu Mountain.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.519
The path is muddy.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.800
Let the horses rest.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:45.480
Wait.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.840
These hoof prints are unusual.

00:34:58.079 --> 00:35:00.519
This is considered a key route.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.639
Seeing hoof prints on the ground
should be usual.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.119
No.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.960
These are Tianlong Cult's
distinctive horseshoes.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.760
They're here.

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:31.360
I've heard about it.

00:35:31.719 --> 00:35:33.360
On the way back last time,

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.440
Tang

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.800
(Linglong Sect, Sect Leader Shi)
ran into Long Zhentian head-on.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.119
(Youyou Sect, Qiao, Langya Sect, Lu)
Who knows what happened?

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:39.800
Could it be

00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:41.440
nothing's left?

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.480
Don't talk nonsense.

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:44.440
(Qinghe Sect Leader Ye)
Sect Leader Tang is experienced.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.039
If they do meet,

00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:48.119
Long Zhentian will likely suffer.

00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:53.440
If nothing happens, he should appear.

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:55.280
Look at the time.

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:56.320
No more waiting.

00:35:56.679 --> 00:35:57.519
We're here.

00:35:59.559 --> 00:36:01.559
Cangqiong Sect disciple, Chun Ge.

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:02.119
Min.

00:36:02.239 --> 00:36:03.559
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.519
Where is your master?

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.159
Master is unwell
and is in seclusion to recuperate.

00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:10.599
As the acting sect leader,

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.320
I've come specifically

00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:13.440
to meet with you.

00:36:13.719 --> 00:36:14.920
What did I say?

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.519
Trouble is imminent.

00:36:17.519 --> 00:36:19.159
Did your master encounter danger?

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.480
Is he seriously injured?

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.079
He's fine.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.440
What matters now

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:25.199
is for you to leave.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.199
This secret meeting spot
may have been exposed.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.760
Staying longer could be dangerous.

00:36:34.239 --> 00:36:35.000
Sect Leaders.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.320
On our way here,

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:40.079
we found traces
of Tianlong Cult cavalry.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.079
What?

00:36:41.519 --> 00:36:42.880
Could some information have leaked?

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.079
Even if what you say is true,

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.519
Tianlong Cult is nothing to fear.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.599
If they cause trouble
on Zongyu Mountain,

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.800
I'll make sure they go back dead.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.239
Sect Leader Lu.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.960
Now is not the time to be rash.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.920
Although we are sect leaders,

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:58.400
the enemy is strong in manpower.

00:36:58.639 --> 00:36:59.679
And they're in hiding.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.239
If they trap us deep in these mountains,

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.239
just with Langya Sect disciples

00:37:04.239 --> 00:37:05.400
and us together,

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.159
we may not escape.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.559
I'll wait here for them.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.719
Let's see
what Tianlong Cult can do to me.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.039
What do you think, Sect Leader Qiao?

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.360
Asleep again?

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.320
Old man.

00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:20.559
Wake up.

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:21.280
Time to rise.

00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:28.400
Sect Leader Qiao.

00:37:29.039 --> 00:37:29.800
Sect Leader Qiao.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.599
What's going on?

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:41.920
This tea is poisoned.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.840
Judging by his symptoms,

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.450
it should be Tianlong Cult's
Bone-Melting Tendon‑Softening Poison.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.920
Bao Wuji?

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360
You again?

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.960
You poisoned him?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:13.480
Exactly.

00:38:14.199 --> 00:38:15.760
Langya Sect's disciples

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.239
aren't that loyal.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.880
Traitors.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.639
I'll slaughter you all.

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:29.880
Sect Leader Lu.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.000
We're doomed.

00:38:38.639 --> 00:38:40.480
Ambushed in our own home.

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:43.280
You great sects are
secretly conspiring here,

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:46.719
completely disregarding Tianlong Cult,
the supreme of the martial world.

00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:48.440
Today,

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:50.360
I, on behalf of the cult leader,

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.119
will wipe out

00:38:52.119 --> 00:38:53.599
all you crooked sects.

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:56.320
Who are you calling a crooked sect?

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.079
You're the crooked sect.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.760
Why is it you again?

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.119
Why can't it be me?

00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:06.599
Perfect timing.

00:39:07.039 --> 00:39:08.559
I'll wipe you out too.

00:39:09.519 --> 00:39:09.920
Min.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.000
Take care of the sect leaders.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.800
Leave the rest

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:15.679
to me.
