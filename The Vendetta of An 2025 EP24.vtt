[Taiyiji Clinic]

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.370
Xiaoqing,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.480
you're awake.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.410
You were banging around outside.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.080
How could I possibly sleep?

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.500
This reminds me of when we were kids.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.380
I wanted to sleep,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.450
but you were outside beating a drum,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.690
telling Master

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.610
you were training your arms.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.540
Xiaoqing,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.730
this time,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.450
I didn't wake you up on purpose.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.500
Xiaoqing,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.940
let's leave.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.220
Where to?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.060
I don't know.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.930
But if we stay here,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.810
we'll only become hostages,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.770
and Huai'an and the pageboy

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.090
will end up doing things

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.580
they don't want to do

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.810
just to keep us safe.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.180
With the skills I have,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.250
I can't drag them down,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.770
right?

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.620
So I want to take you and break out.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.580
Either we die and be done with it,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.620
or we fight

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.920
our way out.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.900
Sure.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.810
Sounds heroic.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.420

Don't.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.910
You won't be able to kill him.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.130
I came to Cangshui River

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.490
for this exact moment.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.100
Protect His Majesty.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.740

Your Majesty.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.790
You dare to come kill me?

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.210
Didn't you say

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.220
you save the greatest advantage for yourself?

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.450
Why have you come to Cangshui River yourself?

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.370
Once Xiao Wuyang is dead,

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.720
the outcome will be set.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.240
Why wouldn't I come?

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.140
Killing you will bring peace to the realm.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.070
Why would I not dare to kill you?

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.610
Your Majesty.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.330
Kill him.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.130
Understood.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.540
Your Majesty.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.770
You're gravely wounded.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.930
It's nothing. I won't die yet.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.450
Too bad I couldn't cut down Xiao Wuyang.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.810
He is a terrifying opponent.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.060
Xie Huai'an must have

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.540
seen through your plan

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.970
and warned Xiao Wuyang in advance.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.500
This round is the heavenly calamity foretold in the divinations.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.090
He could only guess one part of it.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.570
How are things

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.330

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.610
Your Majesty,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.370
you gave me four liang of gold.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.820
Running errands for you cost one.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.420
Killing those Tiemo lackeys just now

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:09.850
cost two.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.010
There's still one liang left.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.060
I can do one more thing for you.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.610
All right.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.610
Go watch over the salt shop's keeper.

He and I go way back.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.570
Now?

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.810
Yes, now.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.330
Keep him safe,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.260
so I'll have no more worries.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.140
Understand?

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.300
This guy looks unfamiliar.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:42.900
Don't worry.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.780
He can't kill me.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.330
Go on.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.940
Fang Genghui...

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.180
With his swordsmanship,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.500
would he be able to wound me?

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.600
Your Majesty, you are the one who can turn the tide.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.420
Fang Genghui is nowhere near you.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.850
If he can't harm me,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.920
then he can't harm Xiao Wuyang either.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.570
But that's enough.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.570
It's about time.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.420
Come on, let's finish this.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.300
What's wrong?

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.770
Why?

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.330
Must you really kill them?

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.390
Read the military report

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.660

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.800
Compared to what's written there,

a few dead couriers

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.260
are nothing.

"On the 11th day of the second month,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.570
Tiemo gathered a force of over 200,000.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.090
They charged across the battlefield,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.570
crossing the border with unstoppable force.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.520

Tiemo forces broke through Shifu Pass.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.070

North Office fell.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.060
Tiemo's vanguard

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.710
was just 1,300 li from Chang'an."

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.020
We have waited decades

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.420
for this battle.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.420
In the last two generations of Tiemo,

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.500
every man as tall as a horsewhip is a warrior.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.930
With Gu Yu dead,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.210
the Baiwenhu Army

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.380
lost its commander and its morale.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.050
No one can stop

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.140
my warhorses from charging south.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.010
Once past North Office,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.740
it is the territory of the regional commanders.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.530
These men

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.070
long for the empire to collapse

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.160
so they can crown themselves kings.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.890
None of them

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.270
will send troops to aid Chang'an.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.650
Your nation

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.170
is destined to drown in bloodshed.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.740
You keep showing me these reports

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.260
and speaking of your great ambitions.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.770
What are you trying to do?

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.770
My 200,000 Tiemo warriors

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.810
may not be able to trample every corner of your land.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.780
I need you

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.090
to be my puppet emperor.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.210
You will be cursed by the people,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.380
but you will at least be able to keep part of the realm.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.380
When the treaty is signed between our two nations,

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.180
I will leave you half of Chang'an.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.450
My empire is vast,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.320
and you're leaving me half of Chang'an?

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.690
What kind of treaty is this?

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.450
You're forcing me to betray my own country!

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.570
Very well.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.930
Either you cooperate,

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.260
or I take your land by force.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.330
Go ahead and choose.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.330
Why me?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.090
Because you're not like your brother Xiao Wuyang.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.300
If it were him,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.380
he would drag me down

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.780
and perish with me.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.610
So I can only choose you.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.210
Aren't you afraid I'll do the same?

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.720
Then I will enthrone

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.930
a fake emperor like Yan Fengshan did.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.560
It will make no difference to me.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.500
But you,

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.030
born into the imperial clan,

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.660
will become a disgrace who never shouldered the burden of the realm!

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.220
An emperor

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.010
is fated to be lonely.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.840
Some may understand that you had no choice,

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:09.860
but in this world,

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.580
there are too few wise enough to see it.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:40.940
If

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.610
I were to agree

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.370
to your proposal,

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:48.500
what would happen to my brother?

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.280
Xiao Wuyang is not easy to kill,

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.890
but I have devised a plan,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.890
and you will be my final killing move.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.220
The two of you are brothers by blood.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.700
And when he was gravely injured,

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.780
you took care of him.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.780
In this world,

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.940
you are the only one

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.060
he lets his guard down around.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.740
Very well.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.980
I will be

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.780
your puppet emperor.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.610
I did it for Chang'an,

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.170
for the realm!

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.300
Look at you.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.940
You accomplished something

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.850
none of them

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.260
ever could.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.090
Remember this:

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.890
you have grown up.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.320
From today on,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.260
hold your head high.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.460
Remember your own words.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.410
You did it for Chang'an

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.370
and for the realm.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.780
I am giving back

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.130
to you

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.890
what was meant to be yours.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.570
That's him.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.940
Such lengths I went to

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.860
just to kill you.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.220
Indeed.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.570
Such trickery.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.770
Not kingly at all.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.730
Fifteen years ago,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.530
when Yan Fengshan killed Liu Ziwen,

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.330
he already knew my identity.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.490
He secretly mobilized the troops

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.620
and sealed off the northern front.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.220
My years of efforts in hiding and planning

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.050
went to waste just like that.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.240
So

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.730
I traveled alone

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.460
toward the northern lands of Tiemo.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.570
That journey home

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.020
felt

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.430
like a long night that would never see dawn.
(Watch on www.kisskh,id to support Admin)

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.130
But when I stood again on Tiemo soil,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.610
the people in the ritual hall

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.610
came out of Mount Shiluoman

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.370
and placed the golden crown

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.780
of the Tiemo King on my head.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.480
They believed

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.370
I could carry Tiemo's hopes

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.480
and lead them out

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.370
of the bitter cold.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.500
So I returned to Chang'an,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.500
locking myself willingly in Yulong Ridge.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.940
That was the beginning of my path of trickery.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.500
Xiao Wuyang,

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.470
you were born into royalty,

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.130
while I was born a slave.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.170
We were never the same.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.540
But today,

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.940
we are both gravely wounded

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.740
and bearing the same loneliness

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.780
for the realm.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.780
Yes,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.370
Chang'an

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.300
is a city many yearn for.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.460
How beautiful it is.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.940
Take one last look at it.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.610
Go on, look.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.260
You can't kill him!

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.070
What did you promise me?

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.920
You cannot kill him!

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.260
I promised you.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.060
As long as he lives,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.610
you will willingly be my puppet.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:32.720
Isn't that right?

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.980
Take him away.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.980
Are you going to make me

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.500
live and eat with you

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.000
or lock me up the way

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.980
you are locking my brother up?

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.740
If neither,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.260
then leave me alone for a while.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.430
Your Tiemo shadow guards

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.890
are everywhere anyway.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.500
I cannot escape.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.500
Let him be.

00:27:52.215 --> 00:28:02.215
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.260
Go.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.170
I will not see you again.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:08.980
Sir,

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.650
I had no choice.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.260
Right.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.700
Right.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.850
You had your reasons.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.130
But I am just a common man.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.590
I cannot understand!

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.370
I cannot understand

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.170
what reason

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:35.510
could make you

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.850
stab your own brother!

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:43.890
I cannot understand

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.170
why you would

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.700
side

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.170
with the Tiemo people!

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:55.850
I...

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.010
I don't need you

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:02.850
to look after me in old age.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.300
You were never my son anyway.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.450
You killed him.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.060
You killed my son.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.570
You killed my son!

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.090
Oh, Mo!

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.610
He died at the hands of someone like you.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.130
My poor boy!

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:55.890
Get lost.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.780
I'm sorry.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.970
I'm sorry.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.370
I'm sorry!

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:27.280
Hurry.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:27.910
Coming.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.130
Remember your own words.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.020
You did it for Chang'an

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.970
and for the realm.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.450
I am giving back

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.780
to you

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.650
what was meant to be yours.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:10.820
This battle

00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:12.450
has already exposed us.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.450
Should we leave the people

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.780
in Cangshui River alive?

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:17.820
There are thousands in Cangshui River

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.180
and hundreds of thousands in Chang'an.

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:22.040
You cannot kill them all.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.860
The common folk are like cattle and sheep.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.120
Hold your blade firmly,

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.530
and they will obey you.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.080
Understood.

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:34.180
Any news of Xie Huai'an?

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:37.800
Zhu Zhilong said he held

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.210
the greatest authority in Cangshui River,

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.360
and that Xie Huai'an's fate

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.010
would be decided here.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:46.800
He was the first

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.190
to enter Chang'an with me.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.670
He hid his identity for years,

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.250
unafraid of death.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.450
I have never seen him this unsettled.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.220
He fears Your Majesty.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.010
You ordered him to kill Xie Huai'an,

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.400
but he failed.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.370
He does not fear me.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.090
He fears Xie Huai'an.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:09.860
Just now, that boy...

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.780
Killing you will bring peace to the realm.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.620
Why would I not dare to kill you?

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.930
He was one strike away

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.660
from killing me.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.530
We will escort Your Majesty back to Chang'an.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.820
Leave the matters in Cangshui River

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.140
to Zhu Zhilong.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:34.760
Very well.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.200
I was one strike away from killing him.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:38.260
Then you showed up.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.150
You want Xiao Wuyang alive.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.690
I want the King alive.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.090
You and I are the same.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.860
What about your disciples?

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.210
If your king lives,

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.810
your disciples will die.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:04.180
Do you truly

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.890
feel nothing for them?

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:08.140
I arrived late

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.700
because I was gathering men

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.490
to go to the clinic.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.250
The King and you have an agreement.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.480
But you and I do not.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.180
How ruthless.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.060
Do you not fear retribution?

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:20.920
No.

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.940
I have nothing left to lose.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.490
Do you care about the past?

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.160
No.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.410
Everything I have done in this life

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.180
is for Tiemo's future.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.260
White Hair,

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.820
we have enough men in Chang'an

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.970
and in Cangshui River.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.910
You are destined

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.410
to lose this battle.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:07.050
We searched the entire shoal.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.340
No trace of him.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.570
No need to keep searching.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:14.410
But...

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.240
we made a promise to the King.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.660
I thought of someone.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.890
Like me,

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:22.450
he now has

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.050
no family left.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.370
Xie Huai'an owes him,

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:29.450
and yet that man

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.390
still helps him without regard

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:32.700
for his own life.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.700
In all of Cangshui River,

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.440
if Xie Huai'an

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.960
still cares about anyone's life,

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.060
it must be his.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.260
You finally came.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.530
Yes, Master.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.220
I came to see you.
