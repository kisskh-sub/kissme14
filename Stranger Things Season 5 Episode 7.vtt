00:17.267 --> 00:18.184
Max.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.356
Max. Max, can you hear me? Max.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.526
Come on. Open your eyes. Yes! Yes, Max!

00:27.027 --> 00:28.111
Can you hear me?

00:28.194 --> 00:30.196
Max!

00:30.989 --> 00:32.615
Yes! Stay with me. Stay with me.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.242
All the way, Max.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.454
Yes! That's it! That's it!

00:43.168 --> 00:44.961
Hello, Lucas.

00:45.045 --> 00:50.175
Yes. Max. Come on, Max. It's me.
I'm right here. I'm right here, Max.

00:54.054 --> 00:58.767
Are you… Are you… Are you okay?
Do you… Do you hurt anywhere?

01:00.101 --> 01:04.189
I can't feel… much.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.859
Do you… Do you feel this?
Do you feel my hand?

01:08.902 --> 01:09.819
A little.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.530
Can… Can you… Can you see?

01:13.323 --> 01:18.578
The lights are really… are really bright.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.580
Hey.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.876
You haven't used your eyes, okay,
or your muscles for a long time.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.754
Okay, your body's just weak,

01:27.837 --> 01:30.840
but it just needs to readjust
and learn again.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.636
You are going to be okay.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.304
You're gonna be okay.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.017
I knew you were there.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.395
I always knew you were still there.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.941
I saw you.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.652
Waiting for me,

01:50.735 --> 01:54.239
playing my… my song.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.075
You bored of it yet?

02:00.703 --> 02:01.913
Are you?

02:07.418 --> 02:08.711
It turns out

02:10.296 --> 02:11.881
that the whole time,

02:14.050 --> 02:15.802
I didn't even need it.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.806
I just needed you.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.935
Just you.

02:24.018 --> 02:28.523
I don't wanna swim forever

02:30.066 --> 02:36.948
When it's cold I'd like to die

02:39.993 --> 02:43.163
I don't wanna…

02:43.246 --> 02:45.456
-Oh my God.
-Max.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.004
You're here. You're really here.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.589
I'm here.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.507
Hey, welcome home, kid.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.052
Took your sweet time, didn't you?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.388
Screw you, Wheeler.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.353
Where am I?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.688
Oh.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.566
Yeah, that would be confusing. Um…

03:11.649 --> 03:13.776
You were being hunted by the Demo-dogs,

03:13.860 --> 03:16.362
and we were all seconds away
from becoming lunch

03:16.446 --> 03:18.364
when Mrs. Wheeler came and…

03:19.616 --> 03:21.284
did the laundry.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.661
Holy shit! Mom!

03:25.246 --> 03:26.289
Vecna.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.542
He'll be angry.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.086
He'll try and find me.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.340
He'll know we escaped.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.218
Where's Holly?

03:41.012 --> 03:41.846
Where is she?

05:59.442 --> 06:00.777
Jonathan.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.404
Jonathan.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.530
Jonathan.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.783
Jonathan, stop.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.536
What?

06:10.620 --> 06:13.414
If we hurt ourselves,
we're really screwed.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.209
Yeah, I guess you're right.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.505
Oh, God.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.802
Okay, so now what?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.887
Anything else you wanna confess?

06:36.729 --> 06:37.939
Stay back.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.408
Sorry we're late.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.205
You okay?

06:54.288 --> 06:57.208
Yeah. Yeah, we're okay.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.923
Thanks.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.885
Was that weird? I'm sorry. That was weird.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.430
I didn't… We just… We both thought…

07:10.513 --> 07:12.682
-We were goners. Yeah, we did too.
-Yes.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.392
Turns out that shield generator of yours…

07:14.475 --> 07:16.769
Isn't really a shield generator.
Yeah, we know.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.022
Well, you'd think that would have been
good information to share.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.732
Well, we tried.

07:21.816 --> 07:22.900
Antenna snapped.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.152
His fault.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.904
Okay, so then what the hell did I shoot?

07:26.988 --> 07:28.448
Exotic matter.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.867
And we're supposed to know what that is?

07:30.950 --> 07:33.703
It's all in here. Look. Check this out.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.206
Dr. Brenner's notebook from '83.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.041
This thing is a gold mine.

07:39.125 --> 07:43.379
All his research into the gate,
how he created it, what it really is.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.214
I'm still deciphering it, but…

07:45.298 --> 07:47.175
Yeah, this shit will fry your brain.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.386
Cliff notes, Holly isn't
on the other side of the wall.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.640
Then where is she?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.602
I don't know… exactly.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.062
But wherever she is,
it's not the Upside Down.

08:21.626 --> 08:25.046
When he took me,
he opened the fourth, final gate,

08:25.129 --> 08:26.339
splitting Hawkins in two.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.629
You can do this.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.700
-What was that?
-What was what?

09:36.951 --> 09:38.286
Holly.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.085
Voyager Beta.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.086
Any signal yet?

11:11.420 --> 11:14.090
Negative, Voyager Alpha. Voyager Gamma?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.009
A big, fat zero over here.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.637
Your balloon experiment is a dud,
Snookums.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.556
Let's just put the antenna on the van
and drive.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.017
As I've said, Voyager Gamma,
given the uneven terrain

11:25.101 --> 11:26.727
and forested nature of Hawkins,

11:26.811 --> 11:29.105
a vehicle
is simply not the most expedient way

11:29.188 --> 11:30.564
to pinpoint a telemetry tag.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.359
"Expedient"? We've been building
your goddamn balloon experiment

11:33.442 --> 11:34.276
for six hours!

11:34.360 --> 11:37.029
Yes, but once we trilaterate
the three signals,

11:37.113 --> 11:39.699
I'll be able to pinpoint
Dustin's precise location.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.493
You can't trilaterate shit
if we can't get a signal,

11:42.576 --> 11:45.496
so let's just cut our losses now

11:45.579 --> 11:48.582
before your star student winds up
dead in a ditch.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.252
"Cut our losses…"

11:59.218 --> 12:01.095
Fortune favors the bold.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.308
I've secured a location on Dustin.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.269
Loose your balloons, Voyagers.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.020
-Come again?
-Wait, hold on. What?

12:10.104 --> 12:14.066
We need more height. Loose your balloons.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.572
Negative 80!

12:20.197 --> 12:21.866
Negative 44.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.161
I take it back, Snookums,
you mad, mad genius!

12:25.244 --> 12:28.164
Thank you, Voyager.
Calculations incoming. Hold tight.

12:41.969 --> 12:46.348
You are going to be my spy

12:46.432 --> 12:50.019
one last time.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.317
Will.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.112
Hopper just radioed.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.406
Max is safe. She got out.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.077
Hey, this is good news.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.873
None of this would have happened
if it weren't for you.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.124
Everything's gonna be okay.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.002
But for how long, Mom?

13:15.085 --> 13:17.880
If Lucas is right, today is the day,

13:17.963 --> 13:19.757
the day Vecna's gonna act.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.718
I thought I had him. But the truth…

13:23.969 --> 13:26.806
The truth is I never stood a chance.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.727
And he knew it. He's always known it.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.439
That's why, out of everyone in Hawkins,
he chose me.

13:36.482 --> 13:43.072
Because he knew I was weak,
and he knew he could control me.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.698
That is not true.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.951
It is, Mom. It is.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.744
I was his vessel.

13:49.745 --> 13:53.749
A vessel to channel his powers, to spy,

13:54.333 --> 13:56.585
and… and to build.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.214
"To… To build"?

14:00.297 --> 14:01.924
The tunnels.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.010
They didn't spread from the gate
on their own.

14:05.594 --> 14:10.933
Every night, I jacked into the hive
and took control of the vines,

14:11.016 --> 14:16.188
using them to tunnel,
infecting our world with the Upside Down.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.358
So many died because of me.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.695
And if I could do all of that,

14:23.529 --> 14:27.032
what could he do with 12 more like me?

14:27.616 --> 14:29.159
You listen to me.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.162
None of what happened is your fault.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.080
Do you hear me?

14:33.664 --> 14:36.000
And as for his big plan,

14:36.083 --> 14:39.086
he's not gonna have 12 vessels,
or whatever the hell he calls them,

14:39.169 --> 14:42.339
because he just lost Holly,
and she'll know where the others are.

14:42.423 --> 14:46.468
Sweetheart, this is not over,
not by a long shot.

14:47.636 --> 14:48.679
You're wrong.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.348
You're wrong, Mom.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.975
It's my fault.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.393
No.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.853
No, baby.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.280
Go! Go!

15:17.917 --> 15:20.169
I couldn't see
where Holly was gonna wake up.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.880
But I figured

15:23.923 --> 15:26.008
wherever Vecna was keeping her,

15:26.842 --> 15:28.802
it had to be in the Upside Down.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.221
So…

15:32.222 --> 15:35.601
I told her to just go home.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.645
Home? Home as in our home?

15:37.728 --> 15:40.314
Meaning we have to get
back into the Upside Down.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.942
-Where is the nearest rift to you?
-Off Cornwallis, I think.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.526
About a mile and a half, give or take.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.986
Lucas, do you copy?

15:46.070 --> 15:46.946
-Oh, Robin.
-Yeah.

15:47.029 --> 15:47.863
Lucas!

15:50.282 --> 15:52.159
Erica, I really can't talk right now.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.036
Okay, so Vecna took out those soldiers,

15:54.119 --> 15:56.080
so it should be a lot easier
to get into the MAC.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.915
No. They're gonna have reinforcements
by now.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.541
I can break through a plate.

15:59.625 --> 16:04.213
Are you saying that Holly is trapped
under a steel plate?

16:04.296 --> 16:06.423
Without context,
that might sound troubling,

16:06.507 --> 16:10.260
but she's not pancaked under a giant hunk
of steel or anything. She's…

16:10.344 --> 16:11.512
How do I talk about this?

16:11.595 --> 16:15.057
-Well, there's this world under ours…
-Under the plates.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.225
The Upside Down.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.894
Yeah, and it's just like Hawkins,
only way suckier.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.356
Guys, guys, guys.
Okay, you really won't believe this,

16:22.439 --> 16:26.026
but Erica and Mr. Clarke came through.
They found Dustin and the others.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.781
All right. Well, they're gonna be able
to find Holly a lot easier than we are.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.953
We better hurry. We got company.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.551
Hey, hey. Are you okay?

16:51.135 --> 16:52.428
I'm fine, Michael. I'm fine.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.888
No, with all due respect, Mrs. Wheeler,
you're not.

16:54.972 --> 16:58.517
You could get an infection, hemorrhage,
God forbid, stop breathing.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.855
If you think I'm gonna stay in bed
when my daughter needs me,

17:02.938 --> 17:06.025
you're out of your goddamn mind. Let's go.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.652
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom. She's right.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.279
It's okay. Keep going.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.990
Hey, you saved us.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.533
You saved us.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.244
And by some miracle,
you're still here, okay?

17:17.327 --> 17:20.414
But now, you need to trust me that
we can handle this the rest of the way.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.542
There might be more of those things
out there.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.335
They're called Demogorgons. I know.

17:25.419 --> 17:29.798
There's so much that I need
to tell you about this Upside Down and El,

17:29.882 --> 17:31.633
but right now, all you need to know is

17:31.717 --> 17:34.887
that this group saved Will
when no one else could.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.180
We did that.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.390
And we're about to do the same thing
with Holly.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.436
We're gonna bring her back to you, Mom.
I promise. Okay?

17:43.937 --> 17:44.855
Yeah?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.494
Mr. Clarke, thanks for the assist.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.661
Don't thank me yet.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.289
We successfully trilaterated
Dustin's position here,

18:02.372 --> 18:03.749
to precisely where I stand now.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.043
But by the time we arrived, he was MIA.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.462
Well, he wouldn't be precisely here.
He'd be under.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.756
Sorry?

18:11.507 --> 18:12.758
You didn't tell him?

18:13.300 --> 18:14.760
-I…
-Told me what?

18:14.843 --> 18:16.512
Holy shit.

18:17.554 --> 18:18.847
Holy shit.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.433
Hey, over here! Over here!

18:23.143 --> 18:24.603
I got him! I got him!

18:24.686 --> 18:26.480
I got Dustin!

18:32.236 --> 18:33.946
-I don't hear anything.
-Patience.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.825
Is anyone there? Repeat, this is Dustin.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.244
Dustin, it's Mike.
Holly's escaped from Vecna,

18:40.327 --> 18:42.371
and she's on her way to my house
in the Upside Down.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.999
I need you to get there as fast as you can
and rendezvous with Holly. Do you copy?

18:46.083 --> 18:49.461
Holly's not at the house.
We found her. We found Holly. Repeat, we--

18:49.545 --> 18:50.963
Dustin, I'm losing you.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.589
Dustin?

18:54.800 --> 18:58.387
Am I going crazy, or did he just say
that he found Holly?

19:00.347 --> 19:03.058
All right, let's hug this wall up here.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.560
Why would she be at the lab?

19:04.643 --> 19:07.271
Wherever she escaped from,
the lab must've been en route to my house.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.731
She just happened to run into Dustin?
What are the odds?

19:09.815 --> 19:10.649
Low as shit,

19:10.732 --> 19:12.776
but I say it's about damn time
we had some luck.

19:12.860 --> 19:13.694
Amen to that.

19:13.777 --> 19:17.322
I'm sorry. I still don't follow.
Dustin is under those plates?

19:17.406 --> 19:18.657
-Yes.
-But not pancaked.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.617
Hang on. Hang on.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.465
Yeah, we got cameras all over that rift.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.760
I have an old spectrum analyzer
back at the club.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.930
If I can just locate their RF signal,
I should be able to jam the transmission.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.223
That's cool.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.559
I think you're overthinking it.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.104
You're telling me Alford
wouldn't have doubled that score?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.856
Four from six from the field.

19:50.939 --> 19:54.026
Reggie's gonna be something special,
you mark my words.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.360
Walsh can do no…

19:59.531 --> 20:01.116
You ain't seen nothing yet.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.947
You coming, Snookums?

20:40.030 --> 20:41.490
We're going in there?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.201
We're going in there.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.412
Steve!

20:47.913 --> 20:49.206
Dustin!

20:49.289 --> 20:50.540
Steve!

20:50.624 --> 20:52.125
Nancy! Holly!

20:52.209 --> 20:53.585
Jonathan!

20:59.883 --> 21:01.677
Is this shit safe to breathe?

21:01.760 --> 21:02.844
Unclear.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.721
Okay.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.808
Mike, any luck down there?

21:07.891 --> 21:10.185
Mike? Mike!

21:11.228 --> 21:12.437
Found him.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.274
Jesus, it's good to see you guys.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.410
Nancy?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.037
Where is she?

21:29.579 --> 21:30.872
Where's Holly?

21:36.503 --> 21:38.297
-What was that?
-What was what?

21:39.631 --> 21:40.924
Holly.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.770
Nancy! Nancy!

21:53.854 --> 21:55.564
-Holly! Holly!
-Nancy, help me!

21:55.647 --> 21:58.191
-Nancy, help me! Help me down, please!
-Holly!

21:58.275 --> 21:59.943
Nancy! Nancy, please!

22:00.027 --> 22:00.902
Holly!

22:00.986 --> 22:02.654
Nancy!

22:08.869 --> 22:13.832
It was like something had a hold
of her, but you couldn't see anything.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.252
It was him.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.173
Vecna. It had to be.

22:23.050 --> 22:23.884
Mike?

22:23.967 --> 22:26.928
Is Holly okay, Mike? Mike, do you copy?

22:27.012 --> 22:29.473
I repeat, is Holly okay?

23:16.895 --> 23:18.897
Don't worry, Holly.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.692
It will all be over soon.

23:24.611 --> 23:28.532
It will all be over.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.540
It was some sort of demon,
a demon from that other world.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.959
He can control monsters,

23:40.293 --> 23:41.586
move Humvees,

23:41.670 --> 23:43.130
stop fire.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.175
Bullets didn't touch him.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.261
Hell, nothing could.

23:49.344 --> 23:50.887
It wasn't a fight.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.641
It was a damn massacre.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.690
First we get mutant dogs at the hospital.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.275
Now a goddamn demon in the MAC?

24:03.358 --> 24:05.569
You wanna tell me what else
is about to pop out of that hellhole,

24:05.652 --> 24:07.028
or should we leave it a surprise?

24:07.112 --> 24:09.948
I don't know if you've noticed,
but suddenly we're light on men.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.700
Reinforcements are on the way.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.870
Any additional requests,
talk to your unit commander.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.581
How am I to know what to request
when I don't know what I'm fighting?

24:17.664 --> 24:21.626
You're not fighting anything.
This is not a war. It is a search.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.420
Something gets in your way, kill it.

24:23.503 --> 24:26.548
But otherwise,
keep your focus on finding the girl.

24:26.631 --> 24:29.134
Yeah, find the girl.
Christ, is that all you can say?

24:29.217 --> 24:32.179
I mean, you got a pull string
under that jacket of yours or what?

24:33.763 --> 24:36.475
Everything that has happened here
is because of that girl.

24:36.558 --> 24:39.186
And if you had just done your job
and found her,

24:39.269 --> 24:42.731
then I wouldn't have to repeat myself,
and we'd have those monsters in Moscow

24:42.814 --> 24:45.942
where they'd be killing Soviets
instead of Americans.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.236
The dead men, the children,

24:48.320 --> 24:50.906
their blood is on your hands, Lieutenant,
not mine.

24:51.490 --> 24:55.911
And unless you want to join them,
I would watch that goddamn tongue.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.585
Lt. Akers, this is Bravo One. Do you copy?

25:06.129 --> 25:07.255
Yeah, what is it?

25:07.339 --> 25:09.424
We've got a rift breach at the old lab.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.301
On my way.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.227
You okay?

25:20.936 --> 25:21.937
Max.

25:27.526 --> 25:32.989
So I leave you alone for a second,
and you turn into a sorcerer?

25:33.073 --> 25:37.077
It was a little more than a second,
and I'm not really a sorcerer.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.120
Mm, sure seemed like it to me.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.916
Hey, you up for a tour?

25:46.002 --> 25:48.255
Jimmy "Fast Hands" skipped town
before quarantine,

25:48.338 --> 25:50.131
so we just sort of moved in here.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.676
The basement is hidden
behind this bookshelf over there.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.594
Not quite the Batcave,
but it's pretty sweet.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.138
We kept the station going as cover.
Robin's our DJ.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.849
-Rockin' Robin.
-Rockin' Robin, my bad.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.393
And Steve's her sound man.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.394
Check this out.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.700
Hey…

26:17.534 --> 26:18.952
We're gonna get Holly back.

26:19.035 --> 26:21.454
She's all alone in there, Lucas.

26:22.038 --> 26:25.041
Alone with that monster.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.961
And I was so sure
that she could make it out.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.588
And I was so stupid.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.007
You had to try.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.134
I should have stayed there.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.305
And I should have kept her safe.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.974
Then we'd all be screwed.

26:41.474 --> 26:44.352
You've been in Vecna's mind.
You can help us beat him.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.855
No. I can't.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.819
I don't even know
where Vecna's keeping Holly.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.487
Well, it's a good thing I do.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.491
I know where she is,
but the real challenge is getting there.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.453
I gotta show you guys something.

27:02.996 --> 27:03.913
Okay.

27:03.997 --> 27:09.044
So, this is Hawkins,
and this is the Upside Down.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.464
We've always assumed the Upside Down
was another dimension opened by Brenner,

27:12.547 --> 27:15.592
but it turns out it's actually a bridge.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.303
More specifically,
an interdimensional bridge

27:18.386 --> 27:19.929
that rips through space-time.

27:20.013 --> 27:23.683
It is wildly unstable,
but held together by exotic matter,

27:23.767 --> 27:27.062
which we found dead center
right above the lab.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.438
In theoretical physics,

27:28.521 --> 27:30.857
-they call this type of bridge a…
-Wormhole.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.943
And this wormhole connects Hawkins
to here,

27:34.027 --> 27:37.530
another world that I've coined the Abyss.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.408
-Any particular reason?
-A realm of pure chaos and evil.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.285
-I'm sorry?
-D&D.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.870
-Jesus Christ.
-Wow.

27:43.953 --> 27:47.832
I believe this Abyss is the true home
of the Demogorgons,

27:47.916 --> 27:49.542
the vines, the Mind Flayer,

27:49.626 --> 27:51.961
all the nasty shit we found
in the Upside Down.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.047
It's where all those years ago
you banished Henry.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.256
He was lost for years,

27:55.340 --> 27:57.092
and would've stayed lost
if it wasn't for Brenner.

27:57.175 --> 27:59.010
He had me find Henry.

27:59.094 --> 28:02.555
And when you made remote contact
with the Abyss, the bridge formed.

28:02.639 --> 28:05.100
Ever since, Henry and his army
of monsters have been using it

28:05.183 --> 28:07.435
to cross right back into Hawkins.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.771
We kicked Vecna's ass last year,

28:09.854 --> 28:13.066
but he just fled across this bridge
back to the Abyss to lick his wounds.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.025
What a pussy.

28:14.109 --> 28:17.654
So all this time,
Vecna's been hiding in the sky?

28:17.737 --> 28:19.906
Explains why every crawl led
to a dead end.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.951
-And why I can't find him in the bath.
-And why Holly fell from the sky.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.953
Yeah, but why is he taking kids up there?

28:25.036 --> 28:26.538
For the same reason he took me.

28:26.621 --> 28:30.583
The minds of children are weaker, right?
More easily molded and controlled.

28:30.667 --> 28:34.254
So he channeled his thoughts and powers
through me to amplify his abilities,

28:34.337 --> 28:35.880
and he's gonna do the same
with those kids.

28:35.964 --> 28:37.632
Amplify his abilities?

28:38.174 --> 28:39.175
To do what?

28:39.259 --> 28:40.343
Move worlds.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.724
Holly, she said Henry told the kids

28:45.807 --> 28:49.561
that they would help him
draw the worlds together.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.022
I didn't understand
what that meant at the time, but…

28:53.106 --> 28:55.984
He wants to move the Abyss,
crash it into Hawkins.

28:56.067 --> 28:56.943
No, not crash.

28:57.527 --> 28:58.570
Merge.

28:58.653 --> 29:02.323
Henry wasn't licking his wounds
in the Abyss. He was making rifts,

29:02.407 --> 29:05.410
weakening the Abyss,
just like he weakened Hawkins.

29:05.493 --> 29:07.203
So when the Abyss and Hawkins collide…

29:07.287 --> 29:08.204
They become one.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.664
He's remaking the world.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.834
How long do we think this takes?
To move worlds?

29:12.917 --> 29:15.670
Are we talking like…
Or is this gonna take some time?

29:15.754 --> 29:18.298
We better hope we have some time.
Because if this is all correct,

29:18.381 --> 29:21.092
we have to get 2,000 feet in the air,
find our way into the Abyss,

29:21.176 --> 29:24.345
free Holly and the kids, and kill Vecna
all before our worlds merge.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.889
And if my theory's right,

29:26.598 --> 29:28.099
he's gonna move worlds tonight.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.018
Have I mentioned
how much I hate your theory?

29:30.101 --> 29:31.144
-Me too.
-Me three.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.813
I hate all of this.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.317
But at least now we know
what we're up against

29:37.942 --> 29:39.194
and what we need to do.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.030
We just need a plan.

30:03.718 --> 30:04.803
I'm sorry.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.639
I don't mean to pry. It's just…

30:07.722 --> 30:09.307
everyone's so worried.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.018
Is she gonna be okay?

30:18.024 --> 30:19.484
But you've told her, right,

30:19.567 --> 30:22.362
that this Max was just
a monster in disguise?

30:22.445 --> 30:25.073
That it was tricking her, lying.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.324
Of course.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.536
I've tried everything,
but she won't listen.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.706
We need her tonight, or we will fail.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.376
What did this Max tell her?

30:36.459 --> 30:39.754
Such awful, awful things.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.090
She told her I kidnapped you.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.842
-What?
-You rescued us.

30:43.925 --> 30:44.926
I know.

30:46.302 --> 30:48.012
That's not even the worst of it.

30:49.097 --> 30:52.976
She told her I don't wanna save the world.
I wanna end it.

30:53.059 --> 30:56.312
-How could she believe that?
-'Cause she's stupid as shit, that's how.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.273
No, she's not stupid, Thomas.

30:59.315 --> 31:02.944
This monster is incredibly powerful,
and she works for the Black Thing.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.737
She has corrupted Holly's mind

31:04.821 --> 31:07.699
and dragged her out of the light
and taken her into the dark.

31:07.782 --> 31:11.160
Maybe we should just give up
and go home then.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.246
-Go home?
-To be with our parents.

31:13.329 --> 31:14.455
We would all die.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.623
What's wrong with you?

31:15.707 --> 31:16.958
Shut your trap, dipshit.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.168
Please let's not turn on each other.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.004
I know we're all upset.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.672
But perhaps Derek is right.

31:23.756 --> 31:27.468
Perhaps I have failed,
and the Black Thing has won.

31:28.344 --> 31:29.971
No, we can't let it win.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.390
Okay? We won't.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.310
You don't know Holly like we do.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.729
I've been her best friend
since kindergarten.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.147
Debbie's her second-best friend.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.441
-And she crushes hard on Josh.
-No, she doesn't.

31:41.524 --> 31:42.692
-She does.
-Totally.

31:42.775 --> 31:46.821
My point is, maybe if we all try
and talk to her, we can fix her.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.949
We can bring her back to the light.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.911
Mary's right. We can do it.

31:52.994 --> 31:53.995
Back to the light.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.413
Back to the light.

31:55.496 --> 32:01.210
Back to the light. Back to the light.
Back to the light. Back to the light.

32:01.294 --> 32:07.675
Back to the light. Back to the light.
Back to the light. Back to the light.

32:07.759 --> 32:12.096
Back to the light.
Back to the light. Back to the light.

32:14.807 --> 32:18.102
As for the security cameras, trench plate…

32:18.603 --> 32:20.271
Not a bolt cutter.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.231
Yeah, you could safely say that, sir.

32:28.696 --> 32:30.281
She's getting reckless.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.367
Sloppy.

32:32.992 --> 32:34.452
Could be one of those damn monsters.

32:34.535 --> 32:37.080
A monster who breaks padlocks and cameras?

32:37.163 --> 32:38.665
I don't think so.

32:41.668 --> 32:42.669
It's her.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.256
Rally the rest of the team.
Tell them to lock and load.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.466
We're going in.

32:52.720 --> 32:57.642
At the base, in the Upside Down,
there's a chopper ready for the taking.

32:59.519 --> 33:03.731
We fly up to the Abyss,
kill the freak, rescue the kids,

33:04.691 --> 33:05.817
fly back down.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.652
Who do you expect to fly this thing?

33:07.735 --> 33:10.029
-It's a helicopter. They've got pilots.
-Right.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.281
-We force one to fly.
-Another kidnapping plot. Love it.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.534
How is this pilot gonna fly a chopper
into the rift?

33:14.617 --> 33:17.036
What do you mean? We just fly through it.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.162
-What?
-Idiot.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.414
Just fly through it?

33:19.497 --> 33:23.084
These rotors are like 40 feet wide.
It's too big. It's not gonna fit.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.503
Steve hears that all the time
and goes in anyway. Don't you?

33:25.586 --> 33:28.006
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-It's funny.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.132
Everybody shut up.

33:29.215 --> 33:33.553
Look, if somebody else has some magic bean
that I don't know about, I'm all ears.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.889
If not, it's a risk that we gotta take.
We fly, or we die.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.850
-Fly or die.
-Well, then I guess we die.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.769
We're not gonna die
if we commit to a plan.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.813
Can we weigh out
a few more options before…

33:43.896 --> 33:45.857
Yes. We die, I guess.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.985
-You said we have to get up 2,000 feet…
-Don't take that shit, Jim.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.862
-You're not listening to each other.
-You guys!

33:50.945 --> 33:52.071
How are you gonna do it?

33:53.072 --> 33:54.073
"Magic bean…"

33:54.157 --> 33:55.950
Can we get back on track?

33:56.034 --> 34:00.079
Let's not even try anything?

34:00.163 --> 34:01.831
We don't need a magic bean to climb.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.249
-…an airplane!
-I'm not--

34:03.332 --> 34:04.709
We don't need a magic bean!

34:06.586 --> 34:10.173
Sorry. Just… We don't… We don't need it.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.091
A magic bean.

34:12.175 --> 34:14.469
We got a beanstalk right here.

34:22.351 --> 34:26.481
Okay, this flashlight is
the Squawk radio tower, and this Slinky…

34:27.899 --> 34:29.108
is the bridge.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.819
We'll never reach the Abyss
from the tower, right?

34:31.903 --> 34:35.031
But Max said Vecna is drawing
our worlds together.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.200
So, we let him.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.869
And we wait and wait

34:39.952 --> 34:43.539
as he draws it closer and closer.
When it's close enough,

34:43.623 --> 34:45.708
and the tower is poking
through one of the rifts,

34:45.792 --> 34:47.376
bam! El makes her move,

34:47.460 --> 34:50.046
she does her meditation thingy,
enters Vecna's sick mind

34:50.129 --> 34:51.005
and ambushes him.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.215
In your face, dickhead.

34:52.298 --> 34:55.051
And then, stopping the spell,
halting the worlds from moving.

34:56.010 --> 34:59.013
Wham, voilà!
We've got a beanstalk. It's perfect.

34:59.597 --> 35:02.016
All we gotta do
is climb up it into the Abyss.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.977
-I like it.
-It's not totally insane.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.063
-Thank you.
-But there's a problem, a big one.

35:07.146 --> 35:10.817
I can't reach inside Vecna's mind.
He's too far away.

35:10.900 --> 35:14.529
Can't you just try? I don't know, load up
on some of your junk food or something?

35:14.612 --> 35:16.197
Or better…

35:16.781 --> 35:17.824
We get you close.

35:18.449 --> 35:22.370
The Upside Down lab is under his lair,
and it's still frozen in time,

35:22.453 --> 35:25.331
which means everything should be there
from Brenner's experiments, including…

35:25.414 --> 35:26.666
The bath.

35:26.749 --> 35:30.294
If you do make it into his mind,
I can walk you through it,

35:30.378 --> 35:31.796
guide you.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.589
I know his sick mind inside and out.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.091
I should be there too.

35:35.174 --> 35:38.970
This plan hinges on stopping Henry,
and right now, Jane is fighting him alone.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.681
It doesn't need to be that way.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.142
I can follow her into his mind.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.938
We can end our brother, together.

35:49.021 --> 35:50.606
Okay, yeah, I dig it.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.651
Sisters kill their brother.
We rescue the kiddos, come home heroes.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.613
And if Lucas is right, we don't have
a lot of time, so we have to move fast.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.698
One final thing.

35:58.781 --> 35:59.866
Cherry on top.

35:59.949 --> 36:04.871
On the way out,
we drop a bomb near the exotic matter.

36:05.913 --> 36:08.791
Set a timer, escape the Upside Down.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.753
The bridge collapses, and with it,

36:13.379 --> 36:18.301
the Abyss, the Demos,
the Mind Flayer, all of it, gone.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.970
Game. Set. Match.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.312
Holly! Holly!

36:29.395 --> 36:32.690
Hey. It's okay. You're safe.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.651
You're safe now. You're with us. Okay?

36:38.696 --> 36:40.198
Welcome back, Holly.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.699
Welcome.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.118
Where is he?

36:44.202 --> 36:45.536
Mr. Whatsit?

36:46.454 --> 36:47.288
Downstairs.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.497
He's worried about you.

36:48.581 --> 36:49.624
So worried.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.585
No, no, no, no, no.
Mary, you need to listen.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.796
Mr. Whatsit, he's not who he says he is.
He didn't really save us.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.298
-He--
-He's kidnapped us?

36:57.798 --> 37:01.093
He's trying to destroy the world?
Holly, Mr. Whatsit has told us everything.

37:01.177 --> 37:04.055
Those are lies. Evil, nasty lies!

37:04.138 --> 37:07.058
-No, they're not! They're not--
-That other girl you met, Max.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.601
She's not a human.

37:08.684 --> 37:09.644
She's a monster.

37:09.727 --> 37:10.853
She twisted your mind.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.647
That's not true.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.482
Max is a friend,

37:14.565 --> 37:16.025
and she's… she's helping us.

37:16.108 --> 37:19.695
She's helping us get back home,
back to our families.

37:20.279 --> 37:21.405
We're all trapped.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.532
Trapped in Mr. Whatsit's mind.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.285
Everything you see, none of it is real!

37:26.786 --> 37:28.329
Come on, you have to believe me.

37:29.038 --> 37:29.914
Please.

37:30.498 --> 37:34.961
You have to believe me.
You have to believe me.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.128
You gotta believe me.

37:38.839 --> 37:40.132
Derek.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.094
Derek, tell them.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.722
Tell them. Tell them!

37:54.480 --> 37:55.982
They're right, Holly.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.608
Max lied to us.

38:06.534 --> 38:09.370
I don't… understand.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.123
Everything she showed me just…

38:13.791 --> 38:16.002
seemed so real.

38:18.587 --> 38:20.673
I knew not to go into the woods.

38:20.756 --> 38:24.593
But I… I went there anyway, and…

38:25.636 --> 38:27.638
And I just… I just feel so…

38:31.100 --> 38:32.268
so stupid.

38:32.768 --> 38:35.855
-You're not stupid, Holly.
-None of this is your fault.

38:35.938 --> 38:36.897
Holly.

38:37.898 --> 38:41.944
You know, the important thing is that
you're here. You're here just in ti--

38:42.737 --> 38:44.238
Holly, stop it!

38:49.118 --> 38:50.786
Bitch! Get her!

38:52.913 --> 38:54.165
Get her!

39:44.090 --> 39:49.512
Well, I was hoping
for a slightly more delicate landing, but…

39:50.179 --> 39:51.972
I suppose that'll do.

39:54.266 --> 39:55.434
You're welcome.

39:59.105 --> 40:01.690
Of all the people she had
to go with, it had to be her.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.735
El trusts her. Maybe we should too.

40:04.819 --> 40:08.239
No, she's up to something.
I'm sure of it. I just…

40:09.240 --> 40:11.117
El's not gonna listen to me.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.577
What happened to the two of you
down there?

40:15.579 --> 40:17.206
She thinks I don't believe in her.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.584
-Which isn't true.
-No, of course not.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.336
Well, have you told her that?

40:23.087 --> 40:24.839
She thinks she's invincible,

40:24.922 --> 40:26.882
and that's not the case.

40:27.466 --> 40:29.468
Yeah, that's not what I asked.

40:29.552 --> 40:32.805
I can work on repairing things between us
when I get on the other side of this,

40:32.888 --> 40:36.308
but right now, I need to make sure
she gets out of this alive.

40:36.392 --> 40:40.312
That Kali makes one false move,
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill her.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.606
I'm gonna kill her. I will not hesitate.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.192
Anything happens to El in that tank,
I am pulling her out.

40:46.652 --> 40:48.195
I can't lose her, Joyce.

40:51.490 --> 40:52.783
I can't.

40:58.330 --> 40:59.957
One last crawl.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.294
One last crawl.

41:17.391 --> 41:20.019
It gives me a headache
trying to understand all this.

41:21.479 --> 41:26.734
But I think I got a C- in physics,
so I'll trust the nerds.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.988
Do you think it'll work? The plan?

41:31.071 --> 41:33.324
I mean, it has to, right?

41:34.825 --> 41:36.827
I just wish I wasn't stuck here.

41:37.453 --> 41:38.746
I feel useless.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.082
El and Kali are gonna need you
in the mind. I'm the one who's useless.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.293
You can still go there, to the Abyss.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.086
It's too risky.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.507
I'd be at the heart of the hive mind,
and I don't know what would happen.

41:49.590 --> 41:53.219
Last time I got too close, he used me
to spy, and it almost got you killed, Max.

41:53.302 --> 41:55.513
You also saved my life, remember?

41:55.596 --> 41:59.350
Plus, I've been almost killed plenty
of times at the hands of this asshole,

41:59.433 --> 42:01.477
so I'm kind of used to it at this point.

42:01.560 --> 42:05.940
How did you survive in there,
this whole time in Henry's mind?

42:06.023 --> 42:07.608
Honestly, luck.

42:09.151 --> 42:10.694
I found this cave.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.614
It was this old memory of his,

42:13.697 --> 42:16.158
and he was terrified of it.

42:17.284 --> 42:18.285
He wouldn't go in.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.913
Scared the living shit out of him.

42:20.996 --> 42:23.832
Underneath all those scars,
he's still human.

42:23.916 --> 42:28.754
A psychopath
with a serious god complex, but…

42:29.964 --> 42:31.298
human.

42:31.382 --> 42:35.219
I guess
we're all scared of something, right?

42:45.604 --> 42:47.815
Okay, Wheeler, how's it going
with your contraption?

42:47.898 --> 42:52.903
Okay, so just imagine that this bike bell
is the bomb's remote trigger, okay?

42:52.987 --> 42:56.156
So when this wire touches
this warrior here, kaboom.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.324
Genius.

42:57.825 --> 43:00.828
One thing is, I don't know
if we can blow up the Upside Down

43:00.911 --> 43:02.830
to the dulcet tones
of the Butthole Surfers.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.999
I built the bomb.
I should be able to pick the record.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.292
You can pick the record.

43:06.375 --> 43:09.003
You just have to follow one simple rule,
which is pick a good record.

43:09.086 --> 43:10.045
This is a great record!

43:10.129 --> 43:13.090
As far as save-the-world soundtracks goes,
this one's lacking.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.216
What would you pick?

43:14.300 --> 43:16.677
The Replacements.
I can't not think of better records.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.887
Okay, enough, Lester Bangs, okay?

43:20.723 --> 43:22.308
Hey. Hey!

43:22.391 --> 43:24.184
Have you handled one of these before?

43:24.268 --> 43:30.399
Not exactly, but, you know, BB guns,
air rifles… …Duck Hunt.

43:30.983 --> 43:32.026
Duck Hunt.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.402
He is remarkably good at it.

43:35.821 --> 43:37.156
But I have a better idea.

43:37.823 --> 43:38.824
Come on.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.294
These babies are deadlier than they look.

43:53.255 --> 43:54.590
You sure?

43:54.673 --> 43:55.841
Mm.

43:59.219 --> 44:00.179
-Hey, Dustin?
-Yeah?

44:00.262 --> 44:03.515
Hey, about, uh, some of the stuff
that I said earlier. I just--

44:03.599 --> 44:05.893
-It's fine. It's okay.
-No, just…

44:06.727 --> 44:08.103
It's not okay.

44:11.023 --> 44:12.024
Eddie…

44:13.776 --> 44:15.152
He saved your life.

44:16.904 --> 44:18.155
Our lives.

44:19.156 --> 44:22.910
And I know what he meant to you.
I can't even imagine how hard it's been.

44:23.452 --> 44:24.787
But instead of…

44:26.664 --> 44:28.707
just being there for you, I just…

44:31.168 --> 44:34.046
Well, I got angry about it. I guess…

44:36.674 --> 44:38.300
I got angry because

44:40.094 --> 44:41.470
things were different.

44:44.139 --> 44:45.057
Because…

44:47.142 --> 44:48.477
I really missed you.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.316
I missed my best friend.

44:57.861 --> 44:59.738
Yeah, I missed my best friend too.

45:13.210 --> 45:16.463
For the record, a Rubik's Cube
isn't even a good measure of intelligence.

45:18.590 --> 45:21.635
And your beanstalk plan, seriously,
only a genius could've come up with that.

45:21.719 --> 45:22.761
Yeah, well…

45:23.804 --> 45:25.055
I learned from the best.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.557
That's true.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.475
Silver lining.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.519
If it fails, we both go down.

45:31.437 --> 45:33.147
You die, I die.

45:36.900 --> 45:37.901
You die, I die.

45:56.044 --> 46:02.718
Gate opening in five, four, three, two…

46:05.596 --> 46:06.847
Open sesame.

46:08.932 --> 46:09.850
Gotcha!

46:11.226 --> 46:14.897
We've secured the gate signal.
Repeat. Gate signal is secure.

46:14.980 --> 46:17.900
Tell Snookums his timing is mwah!

46:17.983 --> 46:20.027
Because Santa's sleigh…

46:22.279 --> 46:23.947
…is almost ready.

46:25.574 --> 46:27.284
Piece of shit!

46:28.744 --> 46:31.079
Oh God! Oh God!

46:31.622 --> 46:34.374
Why?! Why?!
Why do you gotta do this right now?

46:34.458 --> 46:36.001
What? You don't like me? Huh?

46:36.084 --> 46:38.212
It's not me! I'm not the one!
I'm not the one who…

46:38.295 --> 46:39.463
Hi, sister.

46:40.631 --> 46:41.715
Hi.

46:41.799 --> 46:44.051
Have you ever done this before?

46:44.134 --> 46:45.719
Shared your mind like this?

46:48.180 --> 46:49.097
Have you?

46:50.098 --> 46:52.017
With my other psychic friends
all the time.

46:53.644 --> 46:54.978
I'm glad I'm here.

46:55.479 --> 46:56.355
Me too.

46:56.438 --> 46:58.023
Even after yesterday?

47:00.400 --> 47:01.777
Have you thought about it?

47:02.277 --> 47:03.695
What it all means?

47:04.905 --> 47:10.619
I was thinking when we blow up the bridge,
we'll blow up Dr. Kay's lab.

47:11.495 --> 47:12.955
We'll end her experiment.

47:13.038 --> 47:14.456
Kay will simply make a new lab.

47:14.540 --> 47:15.624
So we kill her.

47:15.707 --> 47:18.502
She replaced Papa.
Another will replace her.

47:18.585 --> 47:20.712
We can go away somewhere.
We can hide from them.

47:20.796 --> 47:23.090
Oh, like somewhere
with at least one waterfall?

47:24.758 --> 47:26.593
It's a fantasy, Jane.

47:26.677 --> 47:29.429
If you flee with Mike,
maybe you're safe for a while.

47:29.513 --> 47:31.598
But when they find you, and they will,

47:31.682 --> 47:35.310
they will kill Mike,
just as they killed my friends.

47:35.394 --> 47:37.646
Then they will take you,
and with your blood,

47:37.729 --> 47:40.983
they will create more children,
children who will suffer as we have.

47:41.066 --> 47:45.696
And with these children,
they will open up more gates, more worlds.

47:45.779 --> 47:46.989
Don't you see, Jane?

47:47.865 --> 47:49.157
It's a cycle.

47:49.741 --> 47:52.995
A terrible, vicious cycle.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.372
But we can stop it.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.041
Tonight.

48:06.550 --> 48:07.801
How?

48:08.385 --> 48:10.262
After we kill our brother,

48:10.345 --> 48:12.180
after the children are rescued,

48:12.264 --> 48:14.224
we don't leave with the others.

48:14.725 --> 48:15.851
We stay on the bridge.

48:15.934 --> 48:18.228
When the Upside Down vanishes…

48:21.523 --> 48:22.858
so will we.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.945
It is the only way, Jane.

48:27.613 --> 48:29.656
The only way.

48:33.827 --> 48:36.038
You ladies done meditating?

48:36.121 --> 48:39.207
'Cause Santa's sleigh is ready to fly!

49:05.901 --> 49:06.944
Mom?

49:08.820 --> 49:09.905
Um…

49:12.074 --> 49:17.120
Earlier today when you asked me
what happened in Vecna's mind,

49:17.204 --> 49:19.456
I didn't tell you everything.

49:22.668 --> 49:24.711
When Vecna attacks,

49:24.795 --> 49:29.675
he weakens you
by turning your own mind against you,

49:29.758 --> 49:33.512
by bringing out everything inside you
that hurts.

49:34.304 --> 49:39.601
So I fought back
by focusing on happy memories,

49:39.685 --> 49:42.688
memories from when I was a kid,

49:42.771 --> 49:44.564
and when I wasn't scared,

49:45.482 --> 49:47.234
and when I felt most happy.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.946
That's how I took control in the MAC-Z

49:51.029 --> 49:53.031
and how I killed those Demos.

49:53.615 --> 49:55.701
And I thought the same would work
on Vecna too.

49:55.784 --> 49:57.452
But he found a way past.

50:00.247 --> 50:01.957
And he showed me things, Mom.

50:04.793 --> 50:07.546
He showed me the most awful things.

50:07.629 --> 50:09.006
No, listen.

50:09.089 --> 50:13.260
Whatever he showed you, it's not real.
He plays tricks. He lies.

50:13.343 --> 50:15.429
No, he doesn't.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.140
What he showed me…

50:20.017 --> 50:21.768
it didn't come from him.

50:23.186 --> 50:24.521
It came from me.

50:26.314 --> 50:28.483
He sees everything, Mom.

50:29.109 --> 50:31.778
He sees my thoughts.

50:32.487 --> 50:34.239
He sees my memories.

50:34.990 --> 50:39.703
And he sees my secrets.

50:40.579 --> 50:45.792
But Max, she told me he's also afraid,
which proves I can beat him.

50:46.501 --> 50:49.254
But for me to do that,

50:50.756 --> 50:51.965
you need to know…

50:56.720 --> 50:59.097
I think you need to know the truth.

51:02.350 --> 51:03.685
Oh. Uh…

51:03.769 --> 51:05.771
Sorry. We just heard from Hop.

51:05.854 --> 51:08.607
He's 15 minutes out.
So we should probably leave in five.

51:09.691 --> 51:11.068
Is everything okay?

51:11.151 --> 51:12.652
Yeah, we'll be out in a minute.

51:14.613 --> 51:15.614
Wait.

51:17.032 --> 51:18.784
I think you need to hear this too.

51:20.035 --> 51:21.328
Everyone does.

51:29.503 --> 51:30.420
I…

51:31.588 --> 51:35.926
I… I haven't told any of you this

51:36.718 --> 51:37.719
because…

51:39.387 --> 51:44.684
Because I… I don't… I don't want you
to see me differently.

51:44.768 --> 51:46.561
But the truth is…

51:47.521 --> 51:51.316
The… The truth is I am.

51:51.399 --> 51:52.609
I am different.

51:53.819 --> 51:54.694
I just…

51:55.445 --> 51:59.241
I just pretended like I wasn't
because… because I didn't want to be.

51:59.825 --> 52:04.287
I wanted to be like everyone else.
I wanted to be like my friends and…

52:05.372 --> 52:06.665
And I am like you.

52:07.207 --> 52:10.001
I'm like you in… in almost every way.

52:10.085 --> 52:12.337
We… We like playing
D&D late into the night.

52:12.420 --> 52:14.881
And we like that old-person smell
in Mike's basement.

52:14.965 --> 52:19.177
And we… we like biking to Melvald's
for malted milkshakes.

52:19.261 --> 52:22.013
And we like getting lost in the woods,

52:22.097 --> 52:25.058
and getting lost in Family Video
and arguing about what to rent

52:25.142 --> 52:27.853
and settling on Holy Grail
for the millionth time.

52:27.936 --> 52:31.523
And… And we like Milk Duds
in our popcorn with extra butter.

52:31.606 --> 52:34.860
And we like drinking Coke with Pop Rocks.

52:34.943 --> 52:37.821
And we like bike races and trading comics

52:37.904 --> 52:41.700
and NASA and Steve Martin
and Lucky Charms and…

52:41.783 --> 52:43.285
Literally all the same things.

52:43.368 --> 52:47.581
I just… I just… I… I just…

52:47.664 --> 52:48.707
I…

52:50.667 --> 52:51.710
I…

52:52.419 --> 52:53.461
I…

52:53.545 --> 52:55.380
I don't like girls.

53:08.602 --> 53:09.603
I mean…

53:10.478 --> 53:15.066
I mean I do. Just…
Just not like you guys do.

53:15.650 --> 53:19.738
And I, uh, I had this…
this crush on someone,

53:19.821 --> 53:22.908
even though I know…
I know they're not like me.

53:24.659 --> 53:27.537
But… But then I realized
he's just my Tammy.

53:27.621 --> 53:30.457
And by Tammy,
I mean it was never about him.

53:30.540 --> 53:32.083
It was… It was about me.

53:32.167 --> 53:35.212
And I thought
I was finally okay with myself,

53:35.295 --> 53:37.589
but… but then today…

53:37.672 --> 53:40.800
Today Vecna showed me what would happen
if I did this,

53:40.884 --> 53:43.762
if I told you guys the truth.

53:44.346 --> 53:47.474
He showed me a future, and in this future,

53:47.557 --> 53:51.061
some of you are just…
are just worried for me.

53:51.144 --> 53:53.271
Worried that things will be harder for me.

53:53.355 --> 53:56.566
And it just makes me feel like
something's wrong with me.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.193
So I… So I push you away.

53:58.276 --> 54:01.488
And for the rest of us,
we just drift apart more

54:01.571 --> 54:05.283
and more and more
and more and more until I'm alone.

54:05.367 --> 54:08.954
And I know none of that has happened,
and Vecna can't see into the future.

54:09.037 --> 54:11.831
But he can see into our minds,
and he knows things.

54:11.915 --> 54:16.503
And it just felt so real. It felt so real.

54:16.586 --> 54:17.712
Will.

54:17.796 --> 54:19.631
You gotta listen to me.

54:19.714 --> 54:22.092
That will never ever happen.

54:22.175 --> 54:24.219
You'll never lose me.

54:24.970 --> 54:25.845
Ever.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.598
Okay. Okay.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.850
And you'll never lose me.

54:37.315 --> 54:38.233
Or me.

54:39.359 --> 54:40.235
Or me.

54:41.236 --> 54:42.195
Or me.

54:42.279 --> 54:43.154
Or me.

54:43.822 --> 54:44.864
Or me.

55:01.339 --> 55:03.550
Guess you didn't need truth serum, huh?

55:05.135 --> 55:08.305
Sorry. This sucks,
but you're gonna have to hug me.

55:08.388 --> 55:10.640
Oh, Max.

55:14.352 --> 55:17.522
Just imagine
I'm hugging you really tight, okay?

55:17.605 --> 55:18.690
Okay.

55:27.407 --> 55:28.575
El.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.536
I know you're strong enough
to defeat Vecna.

55:31.619 --> 55:34.205
But he can retreat to the physical world,

55:34.289 --> 55:37.292
and we need to be ready
to fight him there too.

55:37.917 --> 55:41.921
We have bullets and fire,
but none of that helped those soldiers.

55:44.507 --> 55:45.508
I need to be there.

55:48.094 --> 55:49.304
And I'm ready.

55:49.387 --> 55:52.724
I'm ready to show him
I'm not afraid anymore.

56:09.032 --> 56:13.078
That's a confirmation.
Anderson's on that patrol.

56:14.079 --> 56:18.333
Solid copy, Bravo One.
Maintain overwatch. Over.

56:26.299 --> 56:27.592
Hey, McConnell.

56:27.675 --> 56:29.969
We got a delivery tonight
I don't know about?

56:30.053 --> 56:31.513
That's a negative, private.

56:31.596 --> 56:33.598
The hell are you doing, buddy?

56:36.726 --> 56:38.686
Showtime, Snookums!

56:39.270 --> 56:40.313
Mellon.

56:45.068 --> 56:46.236
Oh, shit!

56:48.238 --> 56:49.239
Pardon me!

56:50.657 --> 56:51.825
First gate cleared.

56:51.908 --> 56:55.120
Two hostiles, towers,
ten and eleven o'clock.

57:15.348 --> 57:17.142
Now comes the fun part.

57:47.046 --> 57:49.299
-Come on! Come on!
-Come on! Come on!

57:50.467 --> 57:51.843
Go! Go! Drive!

58:07.192 --> 58:08.735
Whoo-hey!

58:09.652 --> 58:10.487
Yeah!

58:12.947 --> 58:14.699
Jesus Christ.

58:15.283 --> 58:17.744
Everybody all right? Everybody okay?

58:17.827 --> 58:19.954
-Yeah.
-You all right? Everybody all right?

58:20.914 --> 58:22.874
Hey, nice shooting back there.

58:23.541 --> 58:24.375
You too.

58:26.711 --> 58:29.464
I kind of thought that
that was supposed to be the easy part.

58:30.340 --> 58:31.382
It was.

58:32.050 --> 58:33.009
You ready?

58:35.136 --> 58:36.012
Ready.

59:51.087 --> 59:52.088
It's time.
