00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:25.767
Well, yeah, that could work,

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:28.069
but isn't there a more flexible option?

00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:29.604
Right.

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:32.440
Product reviews?

00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:36.744
But those are subjective opinions.
They're not data.

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:38.246
Then what would you suggest?

00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:40.949
Yes, ratings. Things like that.

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:44.586
I'd like a report based on numbers,
like conversion rates.

00:00:45.653 --> 00:00:47.422
What I want is...

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:50.491
evidence everyone can agree on.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:52.327
(Stardam Coffee)

00:00:52.327 --> 00:00:54.429
Yes, exactly. Don't overthink it.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.199
We just look at the numbers
and make a call.

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:01.069
Because numbers, at least,

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.972
don't betray you.

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:05.573
Let's talk again tomorrow.

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:11.045
(The Tasty 2025)

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:14.349
Five stars aren't only good
for stone beds.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.886
These ratings, decided by the majority...

00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:20.355
have dramatically reduced...

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:22.557
the time and energy
spent by busy modern people.

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:39.274
(STARLOVE blind date begins
in 10 minutes.)

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:42.544
Now applied even to people,

00:01:42.544 --> 00:01:46.281
star ratings have become a powerful
barometer of Korea's dating market.

00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:50.785
(Lee Joon)

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:52.086
(Bae Yoon Kyung)

00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:54.856
We go through countless encounters
in life,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.126
and connections,
every connection has a beginning.

00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:01.596
- Through meeting and experience...
- Is this installation art?

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.199
I should post this on my Instagram.

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:05.233
Cool.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:06.601
This is so cool.

00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:08.136
Look at this. It's incredible.

00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:11.906
How did they make this?

00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:23.651
Sorry.

00:02:24.152 --> 00:02:25.653
No, it's fine.

00:02:30.124 --> 00:02:32.160
Birds of a feather flock together.

00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:35.797
Five stars recognize five stars.

00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:37.732
Excuse me.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.767
Yes?

00:02:40.168 --> 00:02:41.236
STARLOVE...

00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:44.172
Honey.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.008
Wait a second.

00:02:47.242 --> 00:02:48.576
What did you say?

00:02:48.576 --> 00:02:50.979
Well, nothing.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:51.846
Sorry.

00:03:01.623 --> 00:03:02.690
This.

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:04.592
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:06.094
Wasn't this an exhibition?

00:03:06.094 --> 00:03:07.729
Jae Seong, let's clear this all out.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:08.563
Yes.

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:11.466
This was trash?

00:03:14.302 --> 00:03:15.303
STARLOVE, right?

00:03:18.106 --> 00:03:19.340
Yes.

00:03:25.847 --> 00:03:26.748
What?

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:37.492
Let's go.

00:03:38.192 --> 00:03:39.561
The exhibition's on the third floor.

00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:41.329
Why...

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.731
For a blind date.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:01.950
(More Than Stars)

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:12.160
Since you suggested an exhibition hall,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.996
were you expecting a more cultured look?

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:17.131
No, that's not it.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.201
I mean, it kind of is.

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:22.370
Honestly, it is.

00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:25.573
This place sets certain expectations.

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:28.476
And the timing too.
This is a bit unexpected.

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.445
Well, that's because...

00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:32.146
I've been swamped day and night lately.

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:33.514
Lunch break works best for me.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.419
And you need to meet on a weekday
and see how it feels...

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.521
to decide whether to see each other
on the weekend, right?

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:45.627
Are you an artist, by any chance?

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.629
Preparing for another exhibition?

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.631
No, I'm a wallpaper installer.

00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:51.766
This place is my job site for two weeks.

00:04:53.434 --> 00:04:54.402
I see.

00:04:59.274 --> 00:05:00.241
Aren't you getting in?

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.978
The doors are closing.

00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:14.155
Excuse me.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.059
Isn't this kind of strange?

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:19.827
Having a blind date at your workplace.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.530
My workplace is on the first floor.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.033
And we're heading to the gallery
on the third floor for a blind date.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.570
I get what you're saying,
but this is still a blind date.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.738
From where I stand, it feels a bit...

00:05:30.738 --> 00:05:33.908
You seemed
to really enjoy exhibitions earlier.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:41.683
I'm Choi Ha Na.

00:05:44.085 --> 00:05:45.053
Yes.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.421
I'm Lee Kang Min.

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:50.425
Shall we check the rest of our profiles?

00:05:50.425 --> 00:05:51.459
Sure.

00:06:02.437 --> 00:06:04.072
Four point seven stars?

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:06.074
- Your rating...
- What's this?

00:06:11.112 --> 00:06:12.146
Malfunction.

00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:15.049
What?

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:18.052
What? Why is it doing this?

00:06:18.553 --> 00:06:20.355
I can't see anything.

00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:21.322
Ms. Choi?

00:06:21.556 --> 00:06:22.590
Ms. Choi!

00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:26.294
(Under Inspection)

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.735
- Are you okay?
- What?

00:06:37.038 --> 00:06:38.406
Yes, thank you.

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.112
Nothing today is going as expected.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.116
This blind date
feels like a disaster movie.

00:06:50.652 --> 00:06:51.719
A disaster movie?

00:06:53.154 --> 00:06:55.990
Well, if it is,
you just wait to be rescued.

00:06:57.258 --> 00:06:58.426
I think this is actually great.

00:06:59.394 --> 00:07:01.829
It actually helps you focus on the date.

00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:09.404
Should we call STARLOVE?

00:07:10.838 --> 00:07:11.673
Why?

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.577
To ask why they matched
a five-star with a one-star?

00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:18.780
Yes. This doesn't make sense.
They've never made a mistake like this.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:22.717
A mistake?

00:07:23.117 --> 00:07:23.985
What?

00:07:24.686 --> 00:07:27.488
No, that's not what I meant.

00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:30.758
It's just, this is my first time
meeting a one-star.

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:33.461
Right.

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:36.965
It's my first time
meeting a five-star too.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.168
So are we not doing the blind date?

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.737
No, we are. We're doing it.

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:46.307
But how do you do a blind date...

00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:48.443
in a dark elevator like this?

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.686
Why?

00:07:58.686 --> 00:07:59.654
Why...

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.124
- What?
- Come here.

00:08:04.092 --> 00:08:04.959
Okay.

00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:08.596
Poop that tastes like curry
versus curry that tastes like poop.

00:08:08.596 --> 00:08:09.664
Which one would you rather eat?

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:12.133
You want to play
a would-you-rather game right now?

00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:14.335
Lunch break's short.

00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:15.870
If we want to get to know each other,
we have to be bold.

00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:22.744
Curry-flavored poop, I guess.

00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:25.380
Seriously?

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.281
Yes.

00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:29.684
Then would you choose
poop-flavored curry, Ms. Choi?

00:08:29.684 --> 00:08:30.919
Of course.

00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:32.887
I'm eating curry.

00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:37.025
What matters to me is what's real.

00:08:40.295 --> 00:08:41.663
Okay, your turn, Mr. Lee.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:47.402
Hurry. These things should be spontaneous.

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:55.210
Cha Eun Woo versus a billionaire.

00:08:56.177 --> 00:08:57.011
Cha Eun Woo.

00:08:59.047 --> 00:09:00.715
Is that even a question?

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:05.420
Cha Eun...

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.832
Okay, my turn now, right?

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.268
Yes.

00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:25.773
Your standard for love.

00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:27.442
Stars or feelings?

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:30.411
What are you, a teenager?
You fall in love just by feelings?

00:09:30.411 --> 00:09:32.080
That's a bit...

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.215
Then you're saying you can love
based only on star ratings?

00:09:35.216 --> 00:09:37.418
If I really had to choose,

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:40.555
yes. Because it's rational.

00:09:40.555 --> 00:09:42.690
Let's see. There's education,

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.660
career, and lots of other factors.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.896
And it includes
other people's evaluations too.

00:09:50.598 --> 00:09:54.102
So you're the type
who trusts what others say.

00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:56.070
But how did you get five stars?

00:09:56.404 --> 00:09:58.339
Why? Does five stars seem strange?

00:09:58.339 --> 00:09:59.674
Yes, it does.

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:03.645
Everyone rates you high,

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.614
but somehow dating is a no?

00:10:06.614 --> 00:10:08.917
What are you talking about?
I was the one who said no.

00:10:09.617 --> 00:10:12.987
Then how did you end up
with one star, Ms. Choi?

00:10:17.258 --> 00:10:19.761
Why do you keep calling me a one-star?

00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:21.162
What?

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.464
You round yours up.
Why do you round mine down?

00:10:23.464 --> 00:10:25.066
I'm 1.7 stars.

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:28.203
Okay, fine.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.042
But, Ms. Choi,

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:37.579
if you think ratings don't matter,
why use STARLOVE?

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:43.084
Meeting different people is fun.

00:10:44.085 --> 00:10:46.621
STARLOVE is just a tool.

00:10:48.923 --> 00:10:50.058
Mr. Lee.

00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:54.262
Do you really think
you can judge someone by five stars?

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:59.300
Not exactly.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.570
But numbers aren't meaningless either.

00:11:03.471 --> 00:11:06.708
But when numbers come first,

00:11:07.342 --> 00:11:08.643
people only see numbers.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.378
Not people.

00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:18.253
Is that coffee good?

00:11:25.093 --> 00:11:29.297
You don't know food until you taste it,

00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:31.499
and you don't know people
until you experience them.

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:42.377
Looks like our disaster movie
is reaching the end.

00:11:43.177 --> 00:11:44.145
Seems like it.

00:11:47.315 --> 00:11:48.550
Is everyone okay?

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.084
Yes, thank you.

00:11:54.022 --> 00:11:55.657
Sorry.

00:11:55.657 --> 00:11:57.158
- Take care.
- Thank you.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.931
Are you okay?

00:12:03.698 --> 00:12:05.500
You looked pretty startled earlier.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.602
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

00:12:10.371 --> 00:12:13.708
You're very calm, Ms. Choi.

00:12:15.243 --> 00:12:16.110
About what?

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:20.081
About unexpected situations like these.

00:12:23.518 --> 00:12:27.422
Just because something's unexpected
doesn't mean it's bad.

00:12:28.523 --> 00:12:31.292
Sometimes it stays with you longer.

00:12:35.163 --> 00:12:37.732
I enjoyed our disastrous blind date.

00:12:37.732 --> 00:12:39.000
Take care.

00:12:41.402 --> 00:12:42.871
Ms. Choi.

00:12:46.708 --> 00:12:48.176
Aren't we going to see the exhibition?

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.885
Lunch break's over.

00:12:59.721 --> 00:13:01.489
I see. Time flew.

00:13:02.757 --> 00:13:04.926
Then take care.

00:13:08.563 --> 00:13:10.098
Yes, Team Leader.

00:13:10.098 --> 00:13:12.467
I'm here. I'm on my way.

00:13:58.813 --> 00:14:00.648
(Openbuy)

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.189
(Sales Data Analysis)

00:14:09.324 --> 00:14:12.060
(Bestseller Product Analysis)

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:16.130
But when numbers come first,

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:18.366
people only see numbers.

00:14:18.766 --> 00:14:19.801
Not people.

00:14:24.439 --> 00:14:25.273
Hey.

00:14:25.607 --> 00:14:28.076
I heard you scrapped the data
for this promotion.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.780
What's with you, Mr. Data?
You ditched numbers?

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:33.681
Well...

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.786
Hey, with gift sets,

00:14:38.786 --> 00:14:41.389
the buyer and the user
are usually different, right?

00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:42.223
Yeah.

00:14:42.223 --> 00:14:43.424
So...

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:47.528
judging solely by figures or ratings
felt a bit off.

00:14:49.464 --> 00:14:51.165
- She must've been pretty.
- What?

00:14:51.165 --> 00:14:53.167
That one-star lady.

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:55.236
Ratings didn't mean anything.

00:14:55.236 --> 00:14:56.971
What are you talking about? That's not it.

00:14:57.672 --> 00:14:58.806
Really?

00:14:58.806 --> 00:15:01.910
Then she must've been super pretty.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.783
Right. I ran into Seo Hee.

00:15:10.885 --> 00:15:11.786
Where?

00:15:14.355 --> 00:15:16.124
Gongdeok.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.326
She suggested dinner, the three of us.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:20.595
There's no need.

00:15:21.229 --> 00:15:23.464
Yeah, right. No need.

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:30.672
(STARLOVE
Your match's review has arrived.)

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:37.979
Hey, what is it?

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.551
Hey, I'm taking a half day off.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:51.893
Excuse me.

00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:01.202
You really came?

00:16:01.769 --> 00:16:03.037
Why did I get one star?

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:06.274
What?

00:16:06.274 --> 00:16:08.209
Why am I a one-star?

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:13.681
Sorry, everyone.

00:16:22.957 --> 00:16:23.925
Sorry.

00:16:28.763 --> 00:16:31.165
Did you really come all this way
just because of the rating?

00:16:31.165 --> 00:16:32.934
"Just?"

00:16:32.934 --> 00:16:36.371
Do you know how hard I worked
to make my rating five stars?

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:37.205
Excuse me.

00:16:37.939 --> 00:16:41.175
I didn't give that score lightly.
I really thought it through.

00:16:41.743 --> 00:16:44.145
Okay. So you didn't like me.

00:16:44.145 --> 00:16:46.347
That's why I got one star. Is that right?

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:48.182
Yes.

00:16:49.584 --> 00:16:50.585
Let's go on a second date.

00:16:51.085 --> 00:16:52.554
A proper date this time.

00:16:55.757 --> 00:16:56.958
Because of the rating?

00:17:00.962 --> 00:17:02.497
As you can see, I'm pretty busy.

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.066
Hey, Chief Choi.

00:17:06.334 --> 00:17:07.202
Hey.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.205
What do we do?

00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:12.173
I'm afraid you'll have
to swing by the Gongdeok site.

00:17:12.874 --> 00:17:13.775
Gongdeok?

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:16.444
Who's he?

00:17:17.345 --> 00:17:18.346
Nobody.

00:17:19.714 --> 00:17:22.183
But why Gongdeok?
We wrapped that up last week.

00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:24.018
I heard the final payment already came in.

00:17:24.018 --> 00:17:26.754
Remember we left one room
unfinished back then?

00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:29.390
The lady's been on the phone nonstop,
crying her eyes out.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.392
What do we do? We can't really say no.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.261
But right now?

00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:34.562
By myself?

00:17:34.562 --> 00:17:36.965
She says she'll pay quadruple.

00:17:37.866 --> 00:17:39.000
Quadruple?

00:17:41.536 --> 00:17:43.137
Still, how am I supposed to do this alone?

00:17:43.705 --> 00:17:45.240
If you could at least send an assistant...

00:17:59.053 --> 00:18:00.221
Excuse me.

00:18:01.356 --> 00:18:02.690
Would you like to help out for the day?

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.059
No.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.694
Careful.

00:18:07.896 --> 00:18:08.830
Be careful.

00:18:09.564 --> 00:18:12.100
But why are you so hung up on ratings?

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:16.804
Just because everyone else
gave five stars, do I have to do the same?

00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:20.441
Isn't one star a bit harsh?

00:18:21.109 --> 00:18:22.710
What did you dislike about me that much?

00:18:24.512 --> 00:18:26.481
You said love is about ratings.

00:18:27.582 --> 00:18:30.151
You see love as a résumé, Mr. Lee,

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:31.252
but I don't.

00:18:39.761 --> 00:18:41.262
Love.

00:18:41.896 --> 00:18:42.964
Love isn't something...

00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:44.866
you can neatly measure...

00:18:45.366 --> 00:18:48.136
like a task with numbers, right?

00:18:48.136 --> 00:18:50.305
So what I'm saying is, love...

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.241
I mean...

00:19:04.652 --> 00:19:06.688
I'll be honest with you.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.792
I just wanted something to believe in,
even if it was a score.

00:19:16.331 --> 00:19:17.232
Mr. Lee.

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:20.835
All this time,
while you were focused on ratings,

00:19:20.835 --> 00:19:22.804
have you ever really looked at someone?

00:19:24.606 --> 00:19:26.708
It just feels like...

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.276
you go on blind dates not for love,

00:19:28.276 --> 00:19:30.144
but for the score, Mr. Lee.

00:19:32.981 --> 00:19:34.449
I thought if I got good ratings,

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:38.119
love would follow naturally.

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:46.794
Then maybe now,
you can look at people, not numbers.

00:19:52.433 --> 00:19:53.401
I'm right here.

00:20:04.546 --> 00:20:05.713
You must be busy.

00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:08.750
I'm really sorry.

00:20:10.652 --> 00:20:11.619
No, it's okay.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.223
So you're wallpapering the small room too?

00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:17.959
Yes.

00:20:19.193 --> 00:20:20.662
That room was left untouched,

00:20:21.729 --> 00:20:23.164
which makes it harder.

00:20:26.868 --> 00:20:32.240
(My mom)

00:20:45.253 --> 00:20:46.221
This room...

00:20:47.088 --> 00:20:48.823
used to be her son's room.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.995
He died suddenly in an accident,

00:20:54.829 --> 00:20:57.565
and she left the room
exactly as it was for over ten years.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:00.935
Then...

00:21:01.603 --> 00:21:04.472
she finally decided to remodel the house,

00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:08.676
but said
she just couldn't touch this room.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.548
So she decided to wallpaper it instead.

00:21:16.684 --> 00:21:18.319
She must have hesitated a lot.

00:21:20.889 --> 00:21:22.323
I think I understand how she felt.

00:21:26.094 --> 00:21:29.030
(My mom)

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.443
The day I became
a certified wallpaper installer,

00:21:43.177 --> 00:21:44.546
my mom passed away.

00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:50.151
I had promised to do the wallpapering
for her once I get certified.

00:21:55.156 --> 00:21:56.357
So I went back and forth,

00:21:57.191 --> 00:22:01.095
wondering whether I should
go through with it or not.

00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:05.433
But in the end, I just did it.

00:22:07.735 --> 00:22:10.705
Covering old wallpaper...

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:12.473
doesn't erase longing.

00:22:14.475 --> 00:22:17.845
But it does let you start a new story.

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.119
All right, let's get to work.

00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:40.101
Hey.

00:22:40.101 --> 00:22:41.569
What are you doing?

00:22:42.003 --> 00:22:44.239
No, not like that. Just tear it off.

00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:45.673
Wet it.

00:22:46.174 --> 00:22:47.909
- Soak it.
- Water. Okay.

00:22:51.179 --> 00:22:53.615
Okay, wallpaper's off.
I'm going to putty now.

00:23:00.355 --> 00:23:02.323
I watched wallpapering videos.

00:23:02.924 --> 00:23:03.892
I want to do this right.

00:23:10.198 --> 00:23:11.733
This is really heavy.

00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:18.306
No, not that one.
The big, white, round one.

00:23:18.306 --> 00:23:19.274
That's not it.

00:23:20.575 --> 00:23:21.709
That's not it?

00:23:21.709 --> 00:23:22.944
No. Go back and get it again.

00:23:24.946 --> 00:23:25.947
- Rock, paper...
- Scissors.

00:23:25.947 --> 00:23:26.881
Hurry up and go.

00:23:37.325 --> 00:23:38.426
This feels good.

00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:41.296
You worked hard.

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:44.432
The others will finish the rest.

00:23:49.103 --> 00:23:50.038
Ms. Choi.

00:23:51.372 --> 00:23:53.441
Do you do partial wallpapering too?

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:56.511
There's a stain about this big
at my place.

00:23:58.146 --> 00:23:59.247
Of course.

00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:01.449
What kind of stain?

00:24:01.683 --> 00:24:02.817
Wine.

00:24:03.251 --> 00:24:04.185
What?

00:24:11.392 --> 00:24:12.360
Earlier,

00:24:13.528 --> 00:24:15.430
you asked why I'm so obsessed
with ratings, right?

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.602
I...

00:24:21.069 --> 00:24:23.104
once dated someone for three years.

00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:25.540
One day,

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.177
she suggested we join STARLOVE
just for fun.

00:24:31.145 --> 00:24:33.848
She got five stars.

00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:36.451
And I got three.

00:24:37.218 --> 00:24:38.553
And somehow,

00:24:39.954 --> 00:24:41.089
after that day,

00:24:41.456 --> 00:24:45.126
it felt like even the smallest things I do
were being graded.

00:24:45.126 --> 00:24:46.995
I kept comparing myself to others.

00:24:48.563 --> 00:24:51.032
Looking back,

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.036
I think I was always the one
falling short.

00:24:56.604 --> 00:24:58.206
Eventually, we broke up.

00:25:00.775 --> 00:25:01.876
Now I get it.

00:25:01.876 --> 00:25:04.812
You had every reason
to give me one star, Ms. Choi.

00:25:15.823 --> 00:25:18.126
If it hadn't been that one-star review,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.796
we wouldn't have met again like this.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:29.637
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:25:30.705 --> 00:25:31.639
It's nice.

00:25:35.777 --> 00:25:38.012
Come on, let's eat already.

00:25:38.012 --> 00:25:40.281
We worked hard.
So let's eat something good.

00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:42.150
But you said good places have a wait.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.085
I'm starving. I can't wait.

00:25:44.085 --> 00:25:46.087
- Good places naturally have a wait.
- No.

00:25:46.087 --> 00:25:47.622
Then wait. I'll check the reviews.

00:25:47.622 --> 00:25:48.623
Just a second.

00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:50.925
- Why?
- If it tastes good, that's a good place.

00:25:50.925 --> 00:25:51.893
Lee Kang Min?

00:25:59.801 --> 00:26:01.002
Long time no see.

00:26:04.672 --> 00:26:05.607
Hello.

00:26:11.713 --> 00:26:12.847
It's been a while.

00:26:17.752 --> 00:26:19.420
- Two oyster soup bowls, please.
- Yes.

00:26:25.326 --> 00:26:26.494
Have you been well?

00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:29.631
I was actually thinking of calling you.

00:26:30.665 --> 00:26:32.367
Well, yeah.

00:26:37.372 --> 00:26:38.306
That's unexpected.

00:26:39.307 --> 00:26:40.942
I thought you hated places like this.

00:26:42.911 --> 00:26:43.945
I used to.

00:26:45.046 --> 00:26:46.614
I like them now.

00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:56.157
I'm sorry, Kang Min.

00:26:59.827 --> 00:27:00.862
Back then,

00:27:01.796 --> 00:27:03.565
I was too calculating.

00:27:04.532 --> 00:27:05.934
Always weighing things.

00:27:09.237 --> 00:27:10.538
I thought you left...

00:27:11.739 --> 00:27:12.874
because I wasn't enough,

00:27:13.942 --> 00:27:15.710
because I fell short.

00:27:15.977 --> 00:27:17.111
That wasn't it.

00:27:18.146 --> 00:27:20.381
You didn't lose to anyone.

00:27:21.282 --> 00:27:22.250
It's just...

00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:25.019
that my feelings changed.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.522
And I used that as an excuse.

00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:35.663
Seo Hee.

00:27:38.299 --> 00:27:41.336
I think I knew that already.

00:27:42.403 --> 00:27:44.539
I needed the excuse of ratings too.

00:27:45.506 --> 00:27:47.342
It was easier...

00:27:47.342 --> 00:27:50.111
than admitting your feelings had changed.

00:27:53.781 --> 00:27:54.849
And...

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.485
I'm okay now.

00:27:59.554 --> 00:28:02.357
I don't need excuses anymore.

00:28:17.839 --> 00:28:19.274
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:28:23.344 --> 00:28:24.212
Wine?

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:33.254
If you even run into your ex here,

00:28:33.254 --> 00:28:34.722
this place must be legit.

00:28:36.958 --> 00:28:40.161
Just hurry and eat.

00:28:40.161 --> 00:28:42.397
- Eat what? Nothing's out yet.
- You're right.

00:28:43.665 --> 00:28:46.935
I don't know.
Just eat the chives, at least.

00:28:46.935 --> 00:28:48.937
- This is so awkward.
- Of all the ways to meet...

00:28:48.937 --> 00:28:52.340
Then, falling in love in 100 days...

00:28:53.241 --> 00:28:54.809
versus falling in love in five seconds.

00:28:55.677 --> 00:28:58.446
Definitely five seconds. And you?

00:28:58.446 --> 00:28:59.447
Definitely 100 days.

00:29:00.715 --> 00:29:02.250
What are you, Ungnyeo?

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.285
Even a bear becomes human in 100 days.

00:29:04.285 --> 00:29:06.487
How can you fall in love in five seconds?

00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:11.626
Some things are decided in an instant.

00:29:15.597 --> 00:29:16.464
We're here.

00:29:24.138 --> 00:29:25.406
Thanks for today.

00:29:28.576 --> 00:29:29.744
Drive safe.

00:29:31.145 --> 00:29:32.614
You too, Mr. Lee.

00:29:40.088 --> 00:29:41.656
Yes, it was good to see you too.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.260
Ratings are just numbers.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.895
Dinner's on me.

00:29:46.895 --> 00:29:47.795
Hey, what are you doing?

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.066
Mental visualization.

00:29:52.066 --> 00:29:53.635
I've got a blind date this evening.

00:29:56.738 --> 00:29:57.639
Really?

00:29:58.907 --> 00:29:59.941
Wait.

00:30:00.308 --> 00:30:02.644
Why have you been so quiet lately?

00:30:02.944 --> 00:30:04.779
- STARLOVE?
- Yeah.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.781
I quit.

00:30:09.751 --> 00:30:12.153
You quit STARLOVE?

00:30:12.587 --> 00:30:13.488
Why?

00:30:14.188 --> 00:30:17.892
I don't need it anymore.

00:30:19.794 --> 00:30:20.695
One-star?

00:30:21.563 --> 00:30:22.497
That lady...

00:30:22.897 --> 00:30:24.332
must've been really pretty.

00:30:43.351 --> 00:30:44.552
You scared me.

00:30:45.486 --> 00:30:48.056
Second time,
and your posture's getting professional.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:51.526
Just call me. I'm basically doing
the work of 100 people right now.

00:30:51.526 --> 00:30:53.895
Anytime you need me,

00:30:54.829 --> 00:30:55.663
just use me.

00:31:00.902 --> 00:31:02.070
What about this?

00:31:02.604 --> 00:31:05.773
Do you want to keep this?
Should I cut it out for you?

00:31:05.773 --> 00:31:06.674
Yeah, cut it out for me.

00:31:07.976 --> 00:31:08.776
Seriously?

00:31:08.776 --> 00:31:11.312
What do you mean, seriously?
That was a joke.

00:31:12.213 --> 00:31:13.982
Don't joke around.

00:31:13.982 --> 00:31:15.850
Why are you holding a knife like that?

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:17.352
Let's just eat black bean sauce noodles.

00:31:17.952 --> 00:31:19.387
- Noodles?
- Yeah.

00:31:20.722 --> 00:31:24.292
I kind of want ramyun, though.

00:31:24.292 --> 00:31:27.595
That was actually
a pretty dangerous thing to say.

00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:30.265
You're trying to flirt with me,
aren't you?

00:31:31.065 --> 00:31:33.034
What are you even thinking?

00:31:33.535 --> 00:31:35.937
Come to think of it,
what do I usually think about?

00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:38.006
- You're really strange.
- No, I mean...

00:31:38.006 --> 00:31:39.340
What was wrong with what I said?

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.642
Wait a second, Ha Na.

00:31:40.642 --> 00:31:41.743
Come here. I'll make you ramyun.

00:31:41.743 --> 00:31:42.777
Don't.

00:31:42.777 --> 00:31:45.013
What do you mean?
I said I'll make you ramyun.

00:31:45.013 --> 00:31:46.047
I don't know.

00:31:46.047 --> 00:31:46.881
(The Beginning of Love)

00:31:46.881 --> 00:31:47.782
Go away.

00:31:47.782 --> 00:31:50.151
What kind of person did you think I was?

00:31:50.151 --> 00:31:51.419
Let's just eat black bean sauce noodles.

00:31:51.419 --> 00:31:53.121
I think that thought is way stranger.

00:31:53.121 --> 00:31:55.456
Why is making ramyun such a big deal?

00:31:55.456 --> 00:31:58.159
- Flirting, seriously?
- You were flirting.

00:31:58.159 --> 00:32:00.662
I just wanted ramyun.

00:32:00.662 --> 00:32:07.468
(The Beginning of Love)

00:32:08.036 --> 00:32:10.032
(More Than Stars)

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:11.033
