Keep running!

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.440
(Would he set me up?)

00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:18.040
Want to run?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.320
Disturbing the peace.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.320
I changed my mind.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.560
Just kill him.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.480
Help, Miss!

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.320
Such a lovely sight.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.320
Beauty in pairs.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.240
So there's

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.600
another beautiful lady.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.520
You sure know how to have fun.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.520
No need to rush.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.160
Spare me, Miss!

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.520
Spare me, Miss!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.200
How boring.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.040
I'm tired.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.080
Clean this place up.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.160
Take this man's head.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.120
Send it to Father.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.040
Yes.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.560
Leave.

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:47.168
(To my wife, Mai Tian)

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.000
The exam is approaching.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.520
Given all this,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.960
he can still fall asleep?

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.440
Impressive, truly impressive.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.160
This young man

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.760
has quite a relaxed vibe.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.600
Get to the point.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.280
I don't have time today

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.480
to spar with you.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.640
Nothing much.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.080
Though the capital is bustling,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.720
without your voice,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.960
it feels rather dull.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.760
Rather dull?

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.680
But your days look rather pleasant.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.160
Mai Tian is your biological sister,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.960
but this is a private talk
between my wife and me.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.320
If you miss her,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.720
you can write to her yourself.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.240
No need to be here,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.520
reading my letter and mocking me.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.160
I will write to her, naturally.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.040
It's just

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.600
that my handwriting

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.840
isn't as nice as yours.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.600
Your brother is also well.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.080
He only hopes for
your reunion in the capital.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.640
Thank you.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.440
"Thank you."

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.200
No need.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.800
Why would I mention you in my letter?

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.280
To my wife Mai Tian,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.200
reading this is like seeing me.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.480
What's going on here?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.200
Your brother is also well.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.120
He only hopes for
your reunion in the capital.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.840
Why is it crossed out?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.640
No.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.560
I have to go to them.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.120
Father.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.120
Father.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.240
Ye Wuming and my brother in the capital

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.320
make me a bit worried.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.080
I want to go to them.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.440
Alright.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.360
You're all grown up now.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.000
I can't be of much help.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.720
Go if you want to.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.040
Father.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.080
Aren't you coming with me?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.120
Mai Xiang is not here.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.160
I'm getting on in years.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.720
Someone needs to stay at the house.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.960
Besides,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.000
these old bones of mine

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.800
aren't suited for long journeys.

00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:43.720
You go ahead.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.840
Father.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.000
Wait for me to come back.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.760
Okay.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.920
I'll wait for you.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.440
Go.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.720
Yi,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.160
feeling soft-hearted?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.520
I handle things

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.560
better than you.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.840
Let me add a dish for you.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.280
Isn't this the son
of the capital's richest man?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.760
I hear that family dotes on him greatly.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.200
I hope

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.840
you can smooth this matter over.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.400
Fine.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.560
I understand.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.320
In the future,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.440
you must act with more restraint.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.120
You're right.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.560
Now, the threat is eliminated.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.440
I will ensure

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.520
your child becomes
the Crown Prince swiftly.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.680
My lord.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.640
This is the list
of candidates who passed

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.560
the final exam as jinshi scholars.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.200
Deliver it to Chief Examiner Zhao.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.520
Also,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.040
instruct him to find a few more people

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.960
to keep up appearances.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.640
Understood.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.840
(Ye Wuming.)

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.000
(Ye Wuming)
(It's up to you now.)

00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:44.480
(Imperial Academy)

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.640
Stop!

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.760
Women

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.520
aren't allowed to enter here.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.880
Since when

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.680
did the Academy impose such a ban?

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.120
Starting now.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.440
From its founding,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.040
the Academy's purpose was to educate.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.040
Anyone seeking knowledge

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.720
is welcome.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.920
Go somewhere else.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.680
We are merely enforcing the rules.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.360
You...

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.360
So stubborn.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.160
The exam begins!

00:10:41.248 --> 00:10:47.136
(Imperial Academy)

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.920
Wait!

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.760
Turn around.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.520
What are you doing here?

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.280
Get over here.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.600
This place is dangerous.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.680
Why did you come?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.080
I came to see my husband...

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.520
I came to see Ye Wuming.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.320
And you of course.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.480
I came to see both of you.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.080
Well...

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.000
Is Ye Wuming

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.960
taking an exam inside now?

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.720
Yes.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.640
But you definitely can't go in.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.680
Come on!

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.200
There's a Qixi lantern fair.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.920
Let me take you to see the fun.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.160
What about Ye Wuming?

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.280
I'll send someone to tell him later

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.000
to see us at the lantern fair.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.240
Zhifeng,

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.760
I still want to wait for Ye Wuming.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.720
Someone is thinking of me.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.760
What's the point
in waiting for that poor scholar?

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.160
Zhifeng.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.040
No,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.160
someone must be cursing me.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.480
This dress is so nice.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.680
It's for my sister.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.720
Of course it's nice.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.840
It's so lively here.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.760
I wonder when Ye Wuming

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.880
will finish his exam.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.440
Zhifeng.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.000
This mask looks

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.240
exactly like Ye Wuming.

00:12:58.464 --> 00:12:59.650
Clay figures!

00:12:59.665 --> 00:13:00.469
Thanks.

00:13:00.704 --> 00:13:02.528
Clay figures! Come take a look, Miss!

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.160
Such pretty clay figures.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.240
