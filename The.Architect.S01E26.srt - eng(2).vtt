I thought

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.870
Prince Duan's Residence
was immensely powerful

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.039
and was an unbreakable net.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.319
Unexpectedly,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.439
there are also layers of clouds

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.359
outside this net.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.120
I didn't expect

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.560
the one who wants
to wipe out the Shen family

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.879
to be the emperor.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.599
But the truth

00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:23.599
is the moon above the sky.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.200
It still exists

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.359
no matter how much it is blocked.

If we present the evidence

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.719
will he really help
the Shen family overturn the case?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.700
In a realm of light and justice,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.760
no one will

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.599
cover up the Shen family's grievance.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.416
Even so,

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.760

Qin Feng,

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.439
where is Pei Yu?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.990
I've been looking for him
for two days. Why haven't I seen him?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.000
The Governor said he's going to stay
at Xichun House for seven days

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.990
and doesn't want to be disturbed.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.080
What do you think?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.800
Sure.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.840
Call your manager.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.319
These average courtesans

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.280
are boring

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.639
and feel like I'm eating wax.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.960
Yes.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.639
Governor, calm down.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.960
Speaking of courtesans,

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.639
there's no one in the whole capital

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.439
who's like the one
you have in your residence.

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:19.600
Indeed.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.560
She's just pretty.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:24.759
I'm already bored with her.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.879
Governor, don't blame her.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.639
She's new and doesn't know the rules.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.639
You are drunk.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.510
Come back to the residence with me.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.360
You are just a concubine.

00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:49.237
Who are you to care about me?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.560
I found important clues.

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:55.398
It is...

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:56.300
What is more important

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.279
than me drinking

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.279
with my friends?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.560
Go back and wait.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.319
Pei Yu,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.000
have you forgotten

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.000
the words you told me?

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.560
Didn't I ask you to go back and wait?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.079
Know your place

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.040
and don't push it.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.800
I don't know why you are doing this,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.959
but if you tell me the reason,

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.920
I believe...

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.800
Are you done?

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.600
Can you leave now?

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:00.360
Governor,

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.839
are you asking

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.839
such a beautiful woman to leave?

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:04.920
Why don't you

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.199
ask her to dance

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:07.839
and show us

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.399
what she's made of?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.560
Governor,

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.680
are you just acting tough

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:14.170
and not want your precious woman
to perform for others?

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.959
Why would I feel reluctant

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:22.600
when she's just a courtesan?

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.560
Since all of them appreciate you,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.490
why are you still here
and not dance for them?

What did you bring?

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:18.240
This is a secret letter

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:20.799
handed to the foreign general,
Jin Pulu, through an envoy.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.120
The letter is sealed

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:23.879
with Xiao Huaijin's personal stamp.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.990
It can prove the deep ties between
Xiao Huaijin and the foreign kingdom

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.600
that exceed
the secret trade of iron ore.

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:32.840
Since you asked Qin Feng

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.200
to put the letter in the study,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.000
why did you retrieve it?

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.679
I thought you'd submit
the evidence to the emperor.

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:42.480
Now, it seems like you won't do that.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.200
Now is not the time
to overturn the Shen family's case yet.

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:51.240
When is the best time to do that?

00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:52.919
I have my own plans.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.840
I don't accept your plans.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.690
That just makes me insensible,

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:57.759
right?

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.320
An extreme situation

00:10:59.775 --> 00:11:01.120
calls for extreme countermeasures.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.799
You might have millions of ways

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.039
but you won't tell me the truth.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.799
The emperor sees the Shen family
as a pawn.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.240
Do you not see me as a tool, as well?

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.250
You place me in the position
that you think is the most advantageous.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.759
What happened today

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:20.159
was just a temporary solution.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.360
To not affect your plan,

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:24.480
right?

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.519
I won't accept anyone

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.679
harming me

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:31.039
in the name of doing good for me.

00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:36.800
Where are you going?

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.759
Even if you present this letter
before the emperor,

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.990
you still won't
overturn the Shen family's case.

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:45.360
You might even sacrifice your life.

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:50.080
I've lost too many things

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:52.200
until now.

00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:55.360
If I still want to save
what I have remaining,

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:57.840
I have no choice but to move forward.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.919
I can't let you take any more risks!

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.159
Governor Pei, you are great.

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:06.360
But I

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.519
don't need it.

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:23.360
Yunqi.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.360
Yunqi?

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:31.759
Yunqi!

(If you want to save Shen Yunqi,)

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.720
(Come to the bamboo forest
at the hour of Si alone.)

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.559

(End of Episode)

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.990
I'm sounding the drum
to voice out my grievance!

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.080
Heaven, please get rid of evil!

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.200
Reporting for no reason

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:14.120
and disturbing the people.
