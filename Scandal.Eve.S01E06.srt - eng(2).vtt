00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:34.848
As of today, I will be taking over
as the new CEO of Kodama Productions,

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:38.810
in place of my father,
who is now bedridden from illness.

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:40.728
I am Yoko Kodama.

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:46.401
My father built this company
from the ground up

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:51.114
and made it into what it is today
with help from many talents and employees.

00:00:51.948 --> 00:00:55.118
I plan to make
this company flourish even more,

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:59.497
and contribute to the innovation
of the industry as a whole.

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:02.876
I look forward to your support.

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:17.223
Many of our talents joined
because of Mr. Shigeru's charisma.

00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:19.893
Doesn't feel like
Ms. Yoko can live up to him.

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:22.812
You think we'll lose cohesion?

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:29.319
I just hope the talents
won't start leaving us.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:36.075
I will create a new
Kodama Productions with my own strength.

00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:42.290
The winner of the Kodama Productions
Next Star Audition 2020 is…

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:46.169
Ms. Yuri Hara!

00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:47.253
Congratulations!

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:52.634
Come to the center of the stage.

00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:01.184
To achieve that, I will create a new star.

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:06.189
Yuri.

00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:11.903
I've landed a lead role for you
in JBS's Wednesday 9:00 p.m. drama slot.

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:15.114
-What?
-Filming starts next month.

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:19.911
The actor they'd hired had to drop out,
so they offered you the role instead!

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.955
But I'm still--

00:02:22.038 --> 00:02:25.291
You'll be fine!
This is a very rare opportunity.

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:29.337
It's a premium time slot!
And for a series, no less.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.130
You'll be famous overnight!

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:34.676
Okay.

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:36.886
Do your best, okay?

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.054
I will.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.015
Isn't it too soon for Yuri?

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.017
The filming starts so soon.

00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:45.561
JBS practically begged me to.

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:50.608
The conditions aren't ideal, but I secured
a main role for their April series too.

00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:54.529
But if the ratings don't turn out well,
she'll get bashed for certain.

00:02:54.612 --> 00:02:57.740
It's too much for her to handle.
She needs more experience--

00:02:57.824 --> 00:03:01.119
We'll pass up opportunities
if we take our time.

00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:05.999
Now is the time for Yuri
to get her name out.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:08.626
Don't you even get that?

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:10.795
But she's--

00:03:12.213 --> 00:03:14.549
You're no longer in charge of Yuri.

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:29.313
NEW QUEEN OF LOW RATINGS
YURI HARA

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.816
DISASTROUS PERFORMANCE BY LEAD ACTRESS

00:03:37.113 --> 00:03:38.656
How's Yuri doing?

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:44.871
She managed to finish filming,
but she seems pretty shaken up.

00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:48.082
She might need a break.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:50.710
What are you saying?

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.130
Her next shoot is coming up soon.
What about that?

00:03:57.925 --> 00:03:59.135
Excuse me.

00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:02.513
Hello?

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:06.601
What?

00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:12.482
Yuri…

00:04:16.444 --> 00:04:17.487
Yuri…

00:04:22.617 --> 00:04:24.327
Yuri…

00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:30.041
You monster!

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:33.086
You people killed Yuri.

00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:37.548
Give me my Yuri back.

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:39.509
Give her back.

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.178
Give my Yuri back!

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:03.449
Yuri's parents
are threatening to sue the agency.

00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:10.373
They're saying she killed herself
due to the agency's overzealous approach.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.458
How should we respond?

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:19.966
Call Kondo, the journalist.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.559
A SAD FATHER-DAUGHTER STORY
ACTRESS YURI HARA

00:05:29.642 --> 00:05:32.728
THE REASON FOR SUICIDE
WAS A FINANCIAL DISPUTE WITH HER FATHER

00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:34.647
YASUO KONDO, FREELANCE JOURNALIST

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.483
It was a shame what happened to Yuri.

00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:44.907
But there's nothing we can do
about someone's personal troubles.

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:48.661
Is that really so?

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:56.502
I think we share part of the blame
for what happened to Yuri.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.088
Are you saying it was my fault?

00:05:59.672 --> 00:06:04.427
You can't nurture actors by giving them
lead roles that they haven't earned.

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:10.224
I will nurture actors
with a different method.

00:06:13.603 --> 00:06:16.105
Are you saying you plan to go independent…

00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:18.024
and leave us?

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:26.324
Do you really think you can antagonize
Kodama Pro and still get by?

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:31.746
Thank you for all you've done for me.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.925
-Kuryu's leaving us?
-Yes.

00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:47.136
He says he won't renew his contract.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.346
Don't tell me…

00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.015
Yes.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.643
He's signing with Ioka's agency.

00:06:58.356 --> 00:07:02.360
Tell the program directors of all
TV stations to deny Kuryu any roles

00:07:02.443 --> 00:07:05.363
and that we'll withdraw
our talents if they don't comply.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.991
Yes, ma'am.

00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:16.666
JOINT COMPANY INFO SESSION

00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:24.215
Ma'am, do you have a moment?

00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:26.759
Sorry.

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:31.597
-It's about JBS TV's special drama.
-Yes?

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:36.269
The actor starring alongside Mr. Aso
is going to be Kuryu Fujiwara.

00:07:37.103 --> 00:07:38.813
How is that possible?

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.899
JBS wouldn't dare do that.

00:07:42.775 --> 00:07:43.776
Well…

00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:47.280
apparently, the chairman allowed it.

00:07:50.324 --> 00:07:51.951
What is the meaning of this?

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:54.036
Meaning of what?

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.124
Why did you allow Kuryu to get the role?

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.590
Why do you side with Ioka to this extent?

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.928
Do you hate me that much?

00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:13.973
Don't flaunt your own pettiness!

00:08:30.906 --> 00:08:33.034
A US-Japan joint production.

00:08:33.117 --> 00:08:37.538
We'll make the announcement
after the JBS special drama conference.

00:08:37.622 --> 00:08:39.206
So it's finally time.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.835
Let's make sure
your American debut goes well.

00:08:43.794 --> 00:08:44.920
Which is why…

00:08:47.298 --> 00:08:48.382
What is it?

00:08:55.848 --> 00:08:57.475
I'm counting on you, okay?

00:08:58.142 --> 00:08:59.268
Of course.

00:09:00.144 --> 00:09:02.063
I'm very grateful to you.

00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:04.065
I'll repay the favor.

00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:17.536
Sexually assaulted by Aso?

00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:21.082
The other party came to us.

00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:27.296
It was your leadership that made
Mr. Aso into the face of your agency,

00:09:27.963 --> 00:09:31.425
which is precisely why
if people found out about this,

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:33.969
you would be forced
to take responsibility.

00:09:37.431 --> 00:09:40.851
I expect the public
will react quite strongly,

00:09:41.435 --> 00:09:44.772
especially considering the subject matter.

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:56.283
For next year,

00:09:56.367 --> 00:10:01.747
we'll give Buncho exclusive rights to sell
calendars featuring our idol talents.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.418
On top of that…

00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:11.006
I'm sure you need
another scoop in exchange.

00:10:18.514 --> 00:10:21.559
An alleged affair
by celebrity actor Kuryu Fujiwara.

00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:24.395
Should get plenty of attention, no?

00:10:27.898 --> 00:10:30.526
KURYU FUJIWARA DRANK
AND CHEATED WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL

00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:41.370
This is fine.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:50.337
Everything's proceeding smoothly.

00:10:53.257 --> 00:10:54.925
Or so I had thought.

00:10:55.843 --> 00:11:01.015
WILL

00:12:28.727 --> 00:12:29.895
Mom.

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:32.982
Riko.

00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:35.192
She's asleep.

00:12:36.277 --> 00:12:38.070
They said she would survive.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.073
Thank goodness.

00:12:42.408 --> 00:12:44.493
How did this happen?

00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:48.539
What happened?

00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:51.542
Pardon me.

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:56.297
Ms. Hirata?

00:12:59.717 --> 00:13:01.135
Oh dear.

00:13:02.595 --> 00:13:04.680
Excuse me. Are you an acquaintance?

00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:05.723
Not quite.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.226
Here's who I am.

00:13:11.979 --> 00:13:14.315
I'm Kondo, a freelance journalist.

00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:18.736
I was gathering information
from your daughter about a certain case.

00:13:19.486 --> 00:13:21.280
What a close call, though.

00:13:21.363 --> 00:13:23.532
She almost got away.

00:13:23.616 --> 00:13:25.534
They do say dead men tell no tales.

00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:29.288
What do you mean?

00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:30.331
Wait.

00:13:30.998 --> 00:13:32.374
You don't know?

00:13:32.458 --> 00:13:34.293
-It's pretty big news--
-Wait.

00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:36.712
Let's talk outside.

00:13:48.599 --> 00:13:49.725
What are you up to?

00:13:49.808 --> 00:13:51.602
Even coming all the way here.

00:13:52.603 --> 00:13:55.314
What am I up to?
Just gathering information.

00:13:57.066 --> 00:13:59.526
You wrote that article, didn't you?

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.572
The one saying Riko made up
the assault for money and publicity.

00:14:03.656 --> 00:14:04.615
Yes.

00:14:05.282 --> 00:14:08.243
And I plan to write
a follow-up to that one soon.

00:14:08.327 --> 00:14:11.747
About how the hostess
who claimed sexual assault had a relative,

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.791
who happens to work for Weekly Buncho.

00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:18.295
What if Weekly Buncho made her lie
to get a big story out of it?

00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:20.214
Now that's a scoop.

00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:22.549
Can I get…

00:14:24.176 --> 00:14:25.302
a comment on that?

00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:30.182
What are you even thinking?

00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:34.478
My sister almost died.

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:37.398
All because of your made-up article.

00:14:39.608 --> 00:14:41.151
What gives you the right?

00:14:41.735 --> 00:14:44.905
As if you haven't done
the same thing as well.

00:14:48.951 --> 00:14:53.205
Whether it's made-up or not,
it just has to get the public's attention.

00:14:53.956 --> 00:14:56.083
Isn't that what our job's all about?

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.796
Anyway, I'll scram for today.

00:15:02.131 --> 00:15:03.507
I'll come again.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.986
I see. He visited you at the hospital?

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:27.448
He's the freelance journalist
who wrote the article on Riko.

00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:28.991
You should watch out too.

00:15:29.074 --> 00:15:30.576
Thanks for informing me.

00:15:31.118 --> 00:15:33.495
Please stay with Ms. Riko for now.

00:15:33.996 --> 00:15:34.830
Bye.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.209
Ma'am.

00:15:39.835 --> 00:15:40.878
How's Ms. Riko?

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.297
Her life's not in danger.

00:15:45.674 --> 00:15:46.884
That's good.

00:15:47.718 --> 00:15:51.472
But we're back to square one
regarding the sexual assault.

00:15:51.555 --> 00:15:54.475
We can't expect
Ms. Riko's cooperation as she is now.

00:15:54.558 --> 00:15:58.812
The criticism against Ms. Riko
seems to have dialed down for now.

00:15:59.438 --> 00:16:01.940
They're just bored
by the lack of new info.

00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:05.277
If we pursue Aso for the sexual assault,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.030
they'll attack her again
with baseless speculations.

00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:10.532
Just like with Yuri.

00:16:12.576 --> 00:16:13.660
Ms. Saki.

00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:16.330
I'm sorry.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.375
It's about Mr. Fujiwara's online drama.

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:23.170
He's been let go.

00:16:26.465 --> 00:16:29.927
One of his co-stars
was with Kodama Productions,

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.470
and they raised a complaint.

00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:32.763
That's just…

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:34.098
I'm sorry.

00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:39.144
I tried to negotiate with them
to let him stay on, but it didn't work.

00:16:40.813 --> 00:16:42.940
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:44.566
It's not.

00:16:45.317 --> 00:16:47.611
I should have supported you properly.

00:16:49.321 --> 00:16:51.782
You did more than enough
to get things going.

00:16:52.783 --> 00:16:53.700
I'm sorry.

00:16:58.163 --> 00:16:59.123
Do we let Fujiwara…

00:17:03.502 --> 00:17:04.962
I'll tell him myself.

00:17:11.135 --> 00:17:13.554
Sorry to call you here all of a sudden.

00:17:13.637 --> 00:17:14.763
It's fine.

00:17:14.847 --> 00:17:17.599
It's a shame about that online drama.

00:17:17.683 --> 00:17:20.227
-Your comeback was so close.
-What?

00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:23.647
You haven't heard?

00:17:29.486 --> 00:17:31.071
You've made the wrong decision.

00:17:32.573 --> 00:17:34.658
But I'll give you a chance.

00:17:47.462 --> 00:17:49.131
It's not too late for you.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.928
I can guarantee you a comeback
and turn you into a star.

00:17:57.806 --> 00:18:02.686
I wonder if Ioka
could manage the same thing.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.612
EXCLUSIVITY CONTRACT

00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:34.092
THE WRITER OF RIKO'S ARTICLE
CAME TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:18:34.176 --> 00:18:37.554
HE MIGHT BE CONNECTED
TO KODAMA PRODUCTIONS.

00:18:37.638 --> 00:18:40.974
FREELANCE JOURNALIST, YASUO KONDO

00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:46.271
ACTRESS YURI HARA
SUICIDE

00:18:46.355 --> 00:18:48.273
YASUO KONDO, FREELANCE JOURNALIST

00:19:16.677 --> 00:19:18.720
Excuse me, you can't just--

00:19:18.804 --> 00:19:20.013
Ioka.

00:19:20.097 --> 00:19:21.974
What is this? How rude of you--

00:19:22.057 --> 00:19:24.685
It was you. First Yuri and now this.

00:19:25.352 --> 00:19:26.436
What are you on about?

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.065
Riko Hirata tried to commit suicide.
Thankfully, she managed to survive.

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:33.402
Who? I'm afraid
I've never heard that name.

00:19:34.486 --> 00:19:38.031
Ms. Riko tried to go public
about being assaulted by Aso.

00:19:38.115 --> 00:19:41.743
But then an article defaming her came out.
That was your doing, wasn't it?

00:19:41.827 --> 00:19:43.537
Do you have any proof of that?

00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:45.872
Yasuo Kondo.

00:19:46.623 --> 00:19:47.833
I could never forget.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.545
That's the reporter who wrote
an article about Yuri Hara,

00:19:51.628 --> 00:19:54.006
after her suicide four year ago.

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:57.259
He made it seem like her suicide

00:19:57.342 --> 00:19:59.803
was caused by financial disputes
with her father.

00:20:01.138 --> 00:20:03.640
You orchestrated that too, didn't you?

00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:07.978
If people knew that work-related issues
might have caused her suicide,

00:20:08.061 --> 00:20:12.274
it would be seen as a management failure
and damage the agency's reputation!

00:20:14.026 --> 00:20:15.444
Are you done yet?

00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:20.866
I don't have time
for your speculative nonsense.

00:20:22.784 --> 00:20:24.536
Do you not feel anything?

00:20:25.537 --> 00:20:27.956
Do you value
your agency's reputation that much?

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.875
You'd sacrifice lives for it?

00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:31.752
You think that's acceptable?

00:20:31.835 --> 00:20:33.712
You're the one sacrificing lives!

00:20:33.795 --> 00:20:34.588
What?

00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:37.341
What did you ever do
for Yuri Hara and Kuryu Fujiwara?

00:20:37.424 --> 00:20:41.636
You failed to provide a suitable stage
for them or to protect them from harm!

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.138
On the contrary,

00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:46.433
they both lost their future
because they were involved with you.

00:20:47.476 --> 00:20:50.812
And you dare speak to me of management?

00:20:54.608 --> 00:20:57.903
Kuryu learned his lesson the hard way.

00:21:00.155 --> 00:21:01.948
I talked to him just now.

00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:03.867
With Kuryu?

00:21:04.576 --> 00:21:06.453
If he returns to us,

00:21:06.536 --> 00:21:09.915
I promised to get him lead roles
in at least two TV dramas per year,

00:21:09.998 --> 00:21:11.625
as well as four ad contracts.

00:21:11.708 --> 00:21:16.505
And earnings upwards of 200 million yen
in the first year alone.

00:21:16.588 --> 00:21:19.091
You sold him out to a weekly magazine!

00:21:19.174 --> 00:21:21.510
-And now you--
-The choice lies with Kuryu.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.641
I'm curious what choice he'll make.

00:21:28.892 --> 00:21:30.227
Aren't you?

00:21:43.115 --> 00:21:44.908
EXCLUSIVITY CONTRACT

00:22:24.656 --> 00:22:27.742
Please leave a message after the beep.

00:22:31.246 --> 00:22:32.706
Hey, Kuryu?

00:22:33.456 --> 00:22:34.958
I need to talk to you.

00:22:35.917 --> 00:22:37.377
Can you call me back?

00:23:09.117 --> 00:23:10.327
Ninomiya?

00:23:33.892 --> 00:23:35.477
Her condition is stable for now.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.811
She's fine.

00:23:37.646 --> 00:23:38.563
I see.

00:23:57.207 --> 00:24:00.752
Besides your sister,
Aso assaulted others too.

00:24:07.884 --> 00:24:10.762
I went and talked to a couple of them.

00:24:12.806 --> 00:24:13.640
What?

00:24:15.058 --> 00:24:20.063
They saw your sister's post
and found the courage to speak out too.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.944
If multiple people give their testimony,

00:24:26.027 --> 00:24:28.405
his agency can't just
dismiss it all as lies.

00:24:30.907 --> 00:24:31.866
But why?

00:24:34.286 --> 00:24:36.371
If I hadn't given up on the article…

00:24:38.707 --> 00:24:40.458
this wouldn't have happened to her.

00:24:44.212 --> 00:24:46.298
I'm really sorry.

00:24:56.808 --> 00:24:57.767
Kanade…

00:24:59.144 --> 00:25:00.854
you should write the article.

00:25:02.522 --> 00:25:05.442
Make sure your sister's actions
weren't in vain.

00:25:15.243 --> 00:25:16.786
I'll get in touch later.

00:26:09.547 --> 00:26:10.507
Riko!

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.310
They're all talking about me.

00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:28.775
But none of them
are listening to what I said.

00:26:31.277 --> 00:26:34.781
The truth won't get through to anyone!

00:26:41.663 --> 00:26:43.832
I wonder what will happen if I die.

00:26:44.874 --> 00:26:47.710
Will they believe me then?

00:26:52.632 --> 00:26:55.760
Or will they just insult me more?

00:26:58.555 --> 00:26:59.514
Riko!

00:27:03.351 --> 00:27:04.644
Trust in me.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.482
I'll make sure…

00:27:10.817 --> 00:27:12.610
the truth gets out.

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:40.638
Ms. Saki.

00:27:43.433 --> 00:27:44.976
Thanks for coming.

00:27:46.853 --> 00:27:48.980
-I'll have what she had.
-Yes, sir.

00:27:57.822 --> 00:27:59.073
The online drama…

00:28:00.825 --> 00:28:02.035
didn't work out.

00:28:06.748 --> 00:28:07.999
Is that so?

00:28:10.376 --> 00:28:11.377
I'm sorry.

00:28:17.383 --> 00:28:18.426
I just…

00:28:20.094 --> 00:28:23.223
couldn't accept the old ways
where the agency's influence

00:28:23.306 --> 00:28:25.266
determined everything.

00:28:26.726 --> 00:28:29.145
That's why I created Rafale.

00:28:29.938 --> 00:28:32.774
To try to change the industry,
at least a little.

00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:41.157
But really, what I couldn't accept
most of all was myself.

00:28:44.702 --> 00:28:46.454
I couldn't protect Yuri.

00:28:50.667 --> 00:28:55.255
In the end,
I haven't changed a bit since then.

00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:00.677
I ruined your future, too.

00:29:04.764 --> 00:29:05.849
I'm sorry.

00:29:10.562 --> 00:29:11.479
Here you go, sir.

00:29:19.404 --> 00:29:21.072
You met Ms. Yoko, right?

00:29:23.783 --> 00:29:24.617
Yes.

00:29:26.327 --> 00:29:28.162
I heard about the offer she made.

00:29:30.832 --> 00:29:36.254
Whatever you decide,
I promise to respect your wishes.

00:29:44.888 --> 00:29:46.347
I thought about dying.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.020
After that scandal…

00:29:53.605 --> 00:29:57.317
I lost my family, my work, everything.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.985
MET AT A BAR
AND SPENT THE NIGHT AT A HOTEL

00:29:59.068 --> 00:30:02.697
On TV, they were
spreading rumors about me.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:07.619
And on social media,
people were telling me to go die.

00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:13.625
I was genuinely about to lose it.

00:30:15.793 --> 00:30:19.839
Even death seemed better
than going through all of that.

00:30:20.965 --> 00:30:22.091
It really did.

00:30:25.678 --> 00:30:26.638
But…

00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:29.849
In that moment…

00:30:32.644 --> 00:30:34.479
you visited me, Ms. Saki.

00:30:36.064 --> 00:30:38.149
It's because you stayed by my side…

00:30:40.234 --> 00:30:42.362
that I was able to pull through.

00:30:44.405 --> 00:30:46.491
You're the reason I'm still alive.

00:30:47.742 --> 00:30:51.412
I'm only here now
because you were there for me.

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:56.709
That's why I have
no intention of leaving Rafale.

00:30:56.793 --> 00:30:57.710
No matter what.

00:30:59.045 --> 00:30:59.879
Kuryu.

00:31:01.214 --> 00:31:04.759
If we give up now, nothing will change.

00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:06.511
Think of the industry.

00:31:11.265 --> 00:31:16.187
Also, I showed the contract
from Kodama Productions to Mirei too.

00:31:16.938 --> 00:31:17.981
And guess what?

00:31:21.985 --> 00:31:23.486
Can you believe this?

00:31:23.569 --> 00:31:25.363
What are these terms?

00:31:25.446 --> 00:31:27.240
The agency takes a 70% cut?

00:31:28.491 --> 00:31:30.201
Absolutely unbelievable.

00:31:32.328 --> 00:31:33.579
They're mocking you.

00:31:33.663 --> 00:31:35.081
She was pissed.

00:31:35.873 --> 00:31:36.708
What?

00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:39.127
That their cut was too high.

00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:42.630
Even Rafale would be
better than this, she said.

00:31:43.172 --> 00:31:45.049
Wait, "even" Rafale?

00:31:46.676 --> 00:31:47.885
Well, yeah.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.895
I'll keep following your lead, Ms. Saki.

00:32:04.027 --> 00:32:05.028
Thank you.

00:32:20.043 --> 00:32:21.044
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.,

00:32:21.127 --> 00:32:24.464
I'll meet another talent
who was assaulted by Aso.

00:32:24.547 --> 00:32:26.424
She's willing to testify?

00:32:26.507 --> 00:32:27.341
Yes.

00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:30.428
She hadn't even told
her own agency about it yet,

00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:32.764
but Riko's post gave her the motivation.

00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:38.644
But she might face intimidation
from her agency or Kodama Productions

00:32:38.728 --> 00:32:40.563
if she comes forward with her story.

00:32:41.647 --> 00:32:44.734
She wants to continue
her activities in the industry.

00:32:45.359 --> 00:32:46.903
Could you help her out?

00:32:47.653 --> 00:32:50.198
Of course. I'll help in any way I can.

00:32:52.325 --> 00:32:55.119
We can't let this injustice continue.

00:32:56.037 --> 00:33:02.210
Being forced into ignoring
unacceptable behavior is just outrageous.

00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:17.433
Good evening, sir.

00:33:24.065 --> 00:33:26.567
What have you been digging into?

00:33:30.488 --> 00:33:32.698
Did you think I hadn't noticed?

00:33:54.387 --> 00:33:56.597
I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone.

00:33:58.349 --> 00:34:00.351
I'm scared to do it even now.

00:34:02.436 --> 00:34:08.776
But when I saw Riko Hirata's post online,
I knew I couldn't just stay quiet.

00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:13.030
We promise to keep
our sources confidential.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:17.201
Thank you for being brave.

00:34:17.285 --> 00:34:19.579
We'll make sure your courage isn't wasted.

00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:38.472
I'll be talking
to another person tomorrow.

00:34:39.182 --> 00:34:42.977
With this many testimonies,
they can't talk their way out of it.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.938
Only thing left is how to make it public.

00:34:46.022 --> 00:34:49.609
Weekly Buncho would be
the best option, considering its reach.

00:34:49.692 --> 00:34:54.447
I doubt the editor-in-chief will allow it.
It's more likely that he'll cover it up.

00:34:56.157 --> 00:34:58.326
Should we go with a different medium?

00:35:03.247 --> 00:35:04.248
Hello there.

00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:06.584
Sir?

00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:09.670
Why are you here?

00:35:09.754 --> 00:35:11.839
You were making some strange moves.

00:35:12.548 --> 00:35:13.591
I just kept watch.

00:35:15.676 --> 00:35:17.053
Sorry for barging in.

00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:19.889
Please take my card.

00:35:28.814 --> 00:35:32.276
You seriously plan to publish
an article on Aso's sexual assaults?

00:35:34.862 --> 00:35:36.530
It won't just be Buncho.

00:35:37.281 --> 00:35:39.867
You'll be blacklisted
by basically all publishers.

00:35:40.993 --> 00:35:41.994
I'll live with that.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.540
You want to help your sister
at the cost of your career?

00:35:48.376 --> 00:35:49.669
How touching.

00:35:49.752 --> 00:35:51.254
That's not it.

00:35:51.337 --> 00:35:52.964
Her being family is irrelevant.

00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:57.635
As a reporter,
I feel like this is the right call.

00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:07.853
In that case…

00:36:09.146 --> 00:36:10.481
put it in Weekly Buncho.

00:36:12.066 --> 00:36:13.109
What?

00:36:14.277 --> 00:36:17.029
What a fancy office, by the way.

00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:22.868
You'll write it no matter what, right?

00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:24.912
Then write it for Weekly Buncho.

00:36:27.623 --> 00:36:29.250
But why?

00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:31.335
You suppressed the article before.

00:36:34.005 --> 00:36:35.923
What are you plotting now?

00:36:36.632 --> 00:36:38.676
When Ninomiya first came to me,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.763
I thought it was a tough sell
with only one person's account.

00:36:43.389 --> 00:36:48.853
However, the story's different
if you have several people's testimonies.

00:36:49.645 --> 00:36:52.690
A big scoop like this
has to go to Weekly Buncho.

00:36:54.025 --> 00:36:58.404
I plan to mention the connection between
Weekly Buncho and Kodama Productions.

00:36:58.487 --> 00:37:00.448
And your collusion with Yoko Kodama.

00:37:00.531 --> 00:37:01.949
Go right ahead!

00:37:02.033 --> 00:37:03.868
It could ruin your career.

00:37:03.951 --> 00:37:06.454
You might even be dismissed from your job.

00:37:07.246 --> 00:37:09.290
I would expect nothing less.

00:37:12.293 --> 00:37:13.627
It's been long enough.

00:37:16.339 --> 00:37:18.883
I applied to the early retirement program.

00:37:18.966 --> 00:37:21.177
I'll get a hefty severance payment too.

00:37:23.888 --> 00:37:27.141
Organizations are best used
to your benefit, you know?

00:37:28.768 --> 00:37:31.520
I'll be waiting for your draft.

00:37:39.362 --> 00:37:41.197
You've got a nice agency.

00:38:02.885 --> 00:38:04.095
Excuse me.

00:38:04.887 --> 00:38:06.889
Weekly Buncho sent us this.

00:38:09.517 --> 00:38:10.601
REQUEST FOR VERIFICATION

00:38:10.684 --> 00:38:12.520
HIDETO ASO'S SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS

00:38:21.028 --> 00:38:21.862
Yes?

00:38:21.946 --> 00:38:25.032
I just received a questionnaire
from Weekly Buncho.

00:38:25.116 --> 00:38:26.617
This must be a mistake.

00:38:27.535 --> 00:38:28.953
It's not a mistake.

00:38:29.578 --> 00:38:30.871
What do you mean?

00:38:31.997 --> 00:38:34.291
Well, the tides have turned.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.918
Of the times?

00:38:37.128 --> 00:38:38.921
You betrayed me?

00:38:39.004 --> 00:38:40.131
Betrayed?

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.259
Sounds like what
a weekly magazine would do.

00:38:43.342 --> 00:38:46.637
A friend in need
makes for a good scoop indeed.

00:38:48.097 --> 00:38:52.852
I expect you understand what will become
of your standing after doing this?

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.646
Sure.

00:38:57.356 --> 00:39:00.151
I gave up on becoming
the managing director.

00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:04.280
I'm not really the type
to lead an entire organization.

00:39:06.031 --> 00:39:07.074
Goodbye then.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.752
Tell all the news stations
not to cover this.

00:39:18.836 --> 00:39:20.963
And stop the article from coming out!

00:39:21.046 --> 00:39:23.674
-But--
-Just do it, whatever it takes!

00:39:34.477 --> 00:39:36.103
This is the final draft.

00:39:36.187 --> 00:39:38.606
HIDETO ASO'S SEXUAL ASSAULT
LINK BETWEEN KODAMA PRO & BUNCHO?

00:39:40.024 --> 00:39:42.443
Kodama Productions did not respond.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.571
We'll send it to the press then.

00:39:45.654 --> 00:39:48.282
We can finally put an end to everything.

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:53.621
Thank you.

00:39:56.248 --> 00:39:57.249
Ma'am.

00:40:00.252 --> 00:40:01.253
Excuse me.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.632
A visitor for you.

00:40:07.134 --> 00:40:08.260
Akashi?

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:14.517
We need to talk.

00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:07.838
WEEKLY BUNCHO
NOVEMBER 6 ISSUE

00:42:14.845 --> 00:42:16.138
Excuse me.

00:42:32.988 --> 00:42:34.990
UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
ALLEGEDLY FAKED CREDENTIALS

00:42:39.703 --> 00:42:41.705
Looks like it went well.

00:43:28.252 --> 00:43:31.797
I would like to thank
all of you for coming here today.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.009
Just as we informed
the media outlets in advance,

00:43:36.093 --> 00:43:40.097
I called you here to discuss
the details of an article

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.475
which was to be published
in today's issue of Weekly Buncho,

00:43:43.559 --> 00:43:47.187
and contained allegations
of sexual assault by Actor A.

00:43:51.442 --> 00:43:52.609
What is this?

00:43:53.152 --> 00:43:54.528
Didn't you stop the article?

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.407
I saw the questionnaire you sent.

00:43:59.032 --> 00:44:00.534
And you came to stop us?

00:44:01.326 --> 00:44:02.202
It's pointless.

00:44:02.286 --> 00:44:04.872
No. That's not why I'm here.

00:44:07.082 --> 00:44:12.045
The article defaming Ms. Riko Hirata,
the leak about Fujiwara's scandal,

00:44:12.838 --> 00:44:15.674
and the scandal article
after Yuri Hara's death.

00:44:16.592 --> 00:44:19.887
I arranged all of them
as directed by Yoko Kodama.

00:44:20.679 --> 00:44:22.306
I am truly…

00:44:24.391 --> 00:44:26.018
I am truly sorry for what l did!

00:44:31.774 --> 00:44:33.901
I know what Aso did to Ms. Riko…

00:44:35.194 --> 00:44:37.780
and to several other women.

00:44:37.863 --> 00:44:38.906
I knew…

00:44:39.948 --> 00:44:42.910
and turned a blind eye
to it all this time.

00:44:44.328 --> 00:44:49.333
If it's not too late,
I want to provide my testimony.

00:44:50.209 --> 00:44:51.418
Please!

00:44:58.383 --> 00:44:59.259
Akashi.

00:45:08.435 --> 00:45:12.147
Why did you suddenly decide
that you want to testify?

00:45:12.898 --> 00:45:17.444
I want to stop Kodama Productions
and Ms. Yoko herself, with my testimony!

00:45:21.782 --> 00:45:26.078
If you're truly willing
to provide your account,

00:45:26.161 --> 00:45:28.288
it will raise the article's credibility.

00:45:30.457 --> 00:45:31.875
Are you really sure?

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.170
I'm prepared.

00:45:38.048 --> 00:45:39.216
I understand.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.426
I'll start editing at once.

00:45:42.135 --> 00:45:43.512
Please wait!

00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:48.559
Can we stop the publication?

00:45:49.393 --> 00:45:51.770
-What?
-Ma'am, what are you saying?

00:45:51.853 --> 00:45:57.568
If we keep going, we'll be no different
from Kodama Pro and their methods.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:04.074
I think we should take responsibility
for the information we put out there.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:10.163
If we don't, we can't truly change
the current situation.

00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:22.050
In the process
of our independent investigation,

00:46:22.134 --> 00:46:24.511
we obtained several testimonies

00:46:24.595 --> 00:46:27.431
from people who were
sexually assaulted by Actor A.

00:46:28.307 --> 00:46:30.976
Given the similarities in his methods,

00:46:31.059 --> 00:46:35.939
we think there's a high likelihood
he regularly engages in sexual assault.

00:46:36.982 --> 00:46:39.359
As for the particulars of this case,

00:46:39.443 --> 00:46:44.281
we shall not share any details as we
have handed the case over to the police.

00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:48.952
Furthermore, an article was posted online,

00:46:49.036 --> 00:46:53.540
defaming a woman
who tried to speak out about this case,

00:46:53.624 --> 00:46:56.335
accusing her of faking it
for settlement money.

00:46:56.418 --> 00:46:59.338
The contents of this article
are utterly baseless,

00:46:59.421 --> 00:47:02.215
and we are considering
legal action in response.

00:47:03.425 --> 00:47:08.680
Are you talking about the accusation
against Hideto Aso that blew up online?

00:47:08.764 --> 00:47:11.016
Wasn't that a false accusation?

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:12.392
-Right.
-What about it?

00:47:12.476 --> 00:47:14.227
As I said earlier,

00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:17.522
I will not share any details
as to the particulars of the case.

00:47:17.606 --> 00:47:19.858
Then why did you hold
this press conference?

00:47:19.941 --> 00:47:21.943
-Give us an explanation!
-Right!

00:47:22.027 --> 00:47:27.282
If you're not going to tell us anything,
how do we know your claims are true?

00:47:27.366 --> 00:47:28.408
-Yes!
-Exactly!

00:47:28.492 --> 00:47:30.786
Give a proper explanation!

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.122
I will now call upon Ms. Ioka,
representing Rafale,

00:47:34.206 --> 00:47:36.333
and Hirata, a Weekly Buncho reporter,

00:47:36.416 --> 00:47:39.670
to explain the purpose
of this press conference.

00:47:52.182 --> 00:47:54.142
I'm Ioka, CEO of Rafale.

00:47:55.102 --> 00:47:58.897
I have been investigating
Actor A's sexual assault allegations,

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:02.359
alongside Ms. Hirata, who is a reporter.

00:48:03.193 --> 00:48:05.612
But as was mentioned earlier,

00:48:05.696 --> 00:48:11.118
I decided that it was best not to share
the details of the investigation here.

00:48:12.786 --> 00:48:13.745
Nevertheless,

00:48:14.746 --> 00:48:17.124
I called upon you today

00:48:17.791 --> 00:48:22.129
to ask you to reexamine
what gets treated as truth

00:48:22.713 --> 00:48:25.048
in news reportings these days.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:29.010
Weekly magazines, TV, and online news.

00:48:29.094 --> 00:48:32.389
Faced with a torrent
of information in various media,

00:48:32.472 --> 00:48:35.976
how can anyone be sure
whether that information is true?

00:48:36.059 --> 00:48:39.604
I'll tell you how. It gets reported
because that's what the facts say!

00:48:39.688 --> 00:48:40.605
-Yes!
-Exactly!

00:48:40.689 --> 00:48:46.570
I agree that facts are indisputable,
but the truth is a different matter.

00:48:47.529 --> 00:48:51.116
That's because the truth
that the news media portrays

00:48:51.199 --> 00:48:55.370
is fabricated by arbitrarily
omitting and twisting the facts.

00:48:56.121 --> 00:48:59.541
And at times, that fabricated truth…

00:49:01.626 --> 00:49:03.211
can take lives.

00:49:06.465 --> 00:49:10.343
Ms. Hirata over there is a reporter
for Weekly Buncho, right?

00:49:10.927 --> 00:49:14.473
What do you make
of Ms. Ioka's comments just now?

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.225
I share the same sentiment as her.

00:49:18.435 --> 00:49:23.690
Are you saying that you've been reporting
twisted versions of the truth until now?

00:49:24.566 --> 00:49:26.109
Perhaps I have.

00:49:28.945 --> 00:49:35.118
It's all too easy to twist the truth
to your liking in a magazine article,

00:49:35.744 --> 00:49:39.122
while avoiding responsibility
by keeping your name and face hidden.

00:49:40.081 --> 00:49:45.170
Today, we chose to avoid that
by speaking directly to you.

00:49:47.964 --> 00:49:51.176
Are you accusing us
of spreading fake news?

00:49:53.136 --> 00:49:56.389
Let me ask you then.
How many of you can swear

00:49:56.473 --> 00:49:59.643
that you've only ever
written factual information?

00:50:01.186 --> 00:50:03.480
Journalism provides
a great service to society

00:50:03.563 --> 00:50:07.943
by bringing concealed facts
to the public's attention,

00:50:08.026 --> 00:50:09.611
through magazines or otherwise.

00:50:09.694 --> 00:50:12.405
But there's a negative side to it too.

00:50:13.615 --> 00:50:17.285
I don't think it's controversial to state
that some amount of scandals

00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:21.039
are portrayed in a skewed manner
due to industry power dynamics.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:27.754
Those with authority dilute the truth
and spread narratives of their liking.

00:50:27.838 --> 00:50:28.839
And sometimes,

00:50:28.922 --> 00:50:34.094
the news media itself manufactures a truth
that's more likely to stir up the public.

00:50:35.095 --> 00:50:37.347
People then believe
that manufactured truth

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:41.101
and use it as justification
to bring harm to others.

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.688
Sometimes, even threatening their lives.

00:50:45.939 --> 00:50:48.942
Let's stop perpetuating this cycle.

00:50:50.068 --> 00:50:53.572
Do you have any proof
of such manipulation of information?

00:50:54.573 --> 00:50:57.200
For one example,
the higher-ups at Weekly Buncho

00:50:57.284 --> 00:50:59.953
were in a secret alliance
with a major talent agency,

00:51:00.036 --> 00:51:05.000
and suppressed an article on the
aforementioned sexual assault allegations.

00:51:05.083 --> 00:51:07.294
Sir, did you know about this?

00:51:18.972 --> 00:51:20.015
In addition to that,

00:51:20.098 --> 00:51:24.811
this major talent agency ignored
the situation, despite being aware of it,

00:51:24.895 --> 00:51:27.731
and even tried
to cover it up using its influence.

00:51:27.814 --> 00:51:30.275
An inside source confirmed that to us.

00:51:31.735 --> 00:51:33.111
Was that you?

00:51:36.364 --> 00:51:40.201
Furthermore, as for why this incident
happened in the first place,

00:51:40.702 --> 00:51:46.416
I am of the opinion that an old-fashioned
and flawed management style is to blame.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:54.883
While Actor A himself obviously deserves
punishment for his alleged sexual assault,

00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:00.180
the victims of his assault
did not simply remain silent.

00:52:00.931 --> 00:52:06.811
They were robbed of their voice and forced
to live in fear, shame, and solitude.

00:52:08.355 --> 00:52:12.859
No matter how esteemed they may be
or how many fans they may have,

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:17.572
someone who tramples on another's dignity
doesn't deserve to stand on stage.

00:52:19.741 --> 00:52:23.370
I refuse to let Actor A
get away with what he's done.

00:52:24.412 --> 00:52:28.500
However, I believe there's more
that needs to be done.

00:52:29.709 --> 00:52:35.757
He is a product of the old system that
yet exists in the entertainment industry.

00:52:37.008 --> 00:52:42.931
The management was lenient on him due to
his status, and no one could condemn him.

00:52:44.015 --> 00:52:46.142
The women who fell victim to him

00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:50.855
were faced with the fear of losing their
careers if they stood up against him.

00:52:52.107 --> 00:52:57.570
He was allowed to roam free
and create even more victims.

00:52:58.613 --> 00:53:03.868
This incident could very well
be called a man-made tragedy,

00:53:04.494 --> 00:53:08.832
caused by the negligence
and irresponsibility of the industry.

00:53:09.499 --> 00:53:12.836
You used to be a part of
Kodama Productions before, didn't you?

00:53:12.919 --> 00:53:15.130
Why didn't you speak up back then?

00:53:15.213 --> 00:53:17.340
-Right!
-Answer that!

00:53:17.424 --> 00:53:18.842
It's as you say.

00:53:19.426 --> 00:53:22.387
I was once part of Kodama Productions.

00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:26.099
I can't deny that
I overlooked many issues,

00:53:26.182 --> 00:53:29.185
all to stay in line
with the agency's customs.

00:53:30.895 --> 00:53:33.356
I can't erase my past.

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.443
I share part of the responsibility.

00:53:38.778 --> 00:53:41.823
That's why I'm sitting here today.

00:53:43.116 --> 00:53:45.577
Nothing will change
just by wallowing in regret.

00:53:46.411 --> 00:53:50.081
There are systemic issues
that we need to put an end to.

00:53:51.207 --> 00:53:55.545
Favoritism, negligence,
success built on sacrificing others.

00:53:56.296 --> 00:54:00.467
We can't hand over such customs
to the next generation.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:03.511
I believe that putting
an end to these customs

00:54:03.595 --> 00:54:08.767
is a duty borne by all of us,
but especially myself as a participant.

00:54:09.392 --> 00:54:11.436
This is how we take responsibility.

00:54:15.356 --> 00:54:20.278
I call for a third-party investigation
into the actor involved in this case.

00:54:20.361 --> 00:54:23.031
As well as the agency
he is affiliated with.

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.493
If the agency suffers
from systemic issues,

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.746
then I believe it should
be dissolved entirely.

00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:31.623
You don't know a thing.

00:54:32.373 --> 00:54:34.209
You don't know a thing!

00:54:34.793 --> 00:54:37.212
To hell with your preaching!

00:54:40.465 --> 00:54:41.841
Ioka is right!

00:54:42.592 --> 00:54:44.677
We have to take responsibility!

00:54:44.761 --> 00:54:46.012
Responsibility?

00:54:46.679 --> 00:54:49.390
Why do I have to take responsibility?

00:54:51.017 --> 00:54:53.686
Ms. Yoko, what's going on
with this press conference?

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:55.105
Why haven't you stopped it?

00:54:55.188 --> 00:54:56.856
It's your job to--

00:54:58.691 --> 00:55:00.735
Who do you think you are?

00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:03.655
Whose fault do you think this is?

00:55:03.738 --> 00:55:04.572
Ma'am!

00:55:04.656 --> 00:55:08.118
The agency's been backed
into a corner because of you!

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:11.830
It's your fault!

00:55:11.913 --> 00:55:13.957
It's your fault!

00:55:14.582 --> 00:55:18.795
Do you even know how hard
I've had to work?

00:55:19.379 --> 00:55:21.005
All because of you!

00:55:22.132 --> 00:55:26.094
-Do you have any idea what you did?!
-Ma'am. Please stop.

00:55:26.177 --> 00:55:27.804
Calm down!

00:55:27.887 --> 00:55:30.223
-Ma'am!
-It's all your fault!

00:55:34.936 --> 00:55:36.980
Issues with the agency's customs?

00:55:38.314 --> 00:55:40.525
Well, I didn't create them.

00:55:41.442 --> 00:55:42.610
My father did!

00:55:44.028 --> 00:55:46.114
I was trying to change them!

00:55:48.992 --> 00:55:50.827
Until this happened!

00:55:54.622 --> 00:55:58.793
It's true that you inherited
the company from Mr. Shigeru.

00:55:59.878 --> 00:56:04.174
But you didn't try to change
the agency at its core.

00:56:05.675 --> 00:56:08.970
If they pulled in numbers
or were popular enough,

00:56:09.053 --> 00:56:11.681
you'd overlook any unreasonable behavior.

00:56:11.764 --> 00:56:13.391
And if something happened,

00:56:13.474 --> 00:56:17.979
you'd hire a reporter and bend the truth
to protect the talent's reputation.

00:56:18.479 --> 00:56:22.150
But we should have changed our ways.

00:56:23.026 --> 00:56:25.361
And if we couldn't,
we should have ended it.

00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:30.783
That was…

00:56:32.452 --> 00:56:34.746
Mr. Shigeru's final wish.

00:56:37.916 --> 00:56:40.335
The dissolution of Kodama Productions.

00:56:41.544 --> 00:56:45.215
That's what was in the will
that you kept hidden.

00:57:04.234 --> 00:57:06.569
The chairman knew that
the customs of Kodama Pro

00:57:06.653 --> 00:57:08.613
had fallen behind the times.

00:57:09.197 --> 00:57:10.740
I expect she'll be angry.

00:57:12.742 --> 00:57:14.160
Once she finds out.

00:57:14.244 --> 00:57:16.996
Why not tell her directly?

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:21.584
Do you really think she'll listen?

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.090
She takes after me.

00:57:30.093 --> 00:57:33.596
I could only ever teach her
the methods I knew myself.

00:57:42.397 --> 00:57:43.982
I'm leaving her…

00:57:46.818 --> 00:57:48.611
in your care.

00:57:56.619 --> 00:57:58.454
Screw that!

00:58:00.957 --> 00:58:03.126
How dare he act like that now?

00:58:08.131 --> 00:58:11.926
He never did anything fatherly for me.

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:18.600
He clung to the agency until the end…

00:58:20.476 --> 00:58:22.729
and died as if he was running away.

00:58:24.188 --> 00:58:26.941
And then he does this at the end?!

00:58:31.112 --> 00:58:32.488
Why have I…

00:58:38.244 --> 00:58:41.164
What have worked for all this time?

00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:49.213
Pardon me.

01:00:00.159 --> 01:00:03.996
I came to this conference today
for the sake of someone dear to me,

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:10.044
and above all, to grant myself
an opportunity to move forward.

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:12.839
Even if my voice is small,

01:00:12.922 --> 01:00:17.009
I wanted to let it be heard
instead of choosing silence.

01:00:18.428 --> 01:00:19.887
But now,

01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:25.977
I am certain that all the people in this
venue and those listening to us elsewhere,

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:30.314
have received our message loud and clear.

01:00:36.529 --> 01:00:41.117
I believe that at this very moment,
we are standing at a crossroads.

01:00:42.368 --> 01:00:48.916
We live in a time of great schism
between the old and new values.

01:00:50.835 --> 01:00:54.797
But I believe that it is
in that very chaos

01:00:54.881 --> 01:00:58.092
that true change can manifest.

01:01:00.595 --> 01:01:03.264
It takes courage to change.

01:01:04.974 --> 01:01:08.311
The act of speaking out
is accompanied by pain.

01:01:09.437 --> 01:01:11.981
But despite that…

01:01:13.316 --> 01:01:14.859
I want to believe.

01:01:16.402 --> 01:01:19.781
That we have the power to change.

01:01:22.241 --> 01:01:27.914
It is not someone else who will change,
but all of us individually.

01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:31.876
Speak up.

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:33.961
Have doubts.

01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:37.298
Have empathy for the pain of others.

01:01:38.341 --> 01:01:42.470
That is what will help bring about change.

01:01:44.806 --> 01:01:45.932
The future…

01:01:46.933 --> 01:01:50.353
is not to be awaited, but to be created.

01:01:53.481 --> 01:01:57.735
I hope that this moment can be the start…

01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:01.697
of that change.

01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:18.065
