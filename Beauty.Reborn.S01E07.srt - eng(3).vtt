00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.000
You know someone's eyeing your position.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.920
Be more careful with what you do.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.800
It's not that I don't care for you.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.720
But I see you like a little sister.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.240
I really can't think of you any other way.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.360
I told you,
you can't beat my brother's game.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.600
Whether it's true or not, I don't care.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.280
But the fact that he got hurt
because of my brother, that's real.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.280
And that's enough for me.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.120
Even after announcing
the wedding, it's still chaos.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.560
You've got to do something about it.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.560
There's probably only one way left.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.520
You're drenched in sweat!

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.120
What on earth were you doing?
I almost fell flat on my face!

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.680
Hey, are you training
for the world championship or something?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.960
I wanna just crash when I get home,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.720
so I don't lie awake overthinking.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.120
You're beyond help.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.320
Are you saying I should just give up?

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.560
No, but if you're not giving up,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.200
then neither am I.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.400
Here.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.600
But I'm not running around
like a maniac like you.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.320
Sweating ruins the beauty, you know.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.960
Hey, who said that?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.120
Nice save.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.240
No.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.920
I mean, whether you run or not,
it makes no difference anyway.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.400
-Nam!
-Missed!

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.840
-Nam!
-Missed! Careful!

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.640
-Nam, you big-mouthed jerk!
-Still missed!

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.000
I've sent the feedback to the factory
with everyone's comments included.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.560
They promised production will finish

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.000
right on schedule.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.160
As for the marketing plan
the team proposed,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.120
I have no objections. Go ahead as planned.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.320
Hey, are you free this afternoon?
I want to take you somewhere.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.160
Is this business or personal?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.400
I don't want my boss scolding me.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.720
Someone actually dares scold you?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.519
Want me to handle it?
I could tell him to shut up for good.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.720
Mmm, sure.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.600
Go hard on him.
I've been annoyed for ages.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.400
Nah,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.040
I'd feel bad.
He just got punched, remember?

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.600
Not that tough then.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.680
So, where exactly are you taking me?

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.600
Why did you bring me to your house?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.560
You said we had errands to run.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.520
We're reminiscing.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.800
You used to live here for years.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.920
Don't look so confused.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.600
Come with me.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.920
Do you remember

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.360
that time Nam broke the vase and ran off?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.400
You showed up right then
and took the blame for him.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.920
Of course, I remember.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.240
That vase of Uncle Tesho's was expensive.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.160
But actually…

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.120
I didn't just show up by accident.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.280
I saw Mr. Nam break it,
so I took the blame for him.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.560
I thought I'd just get scolded.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.840
If I'd known how valuable it was,
I'd have stayed quiet.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.680
That means

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.640
you were kind to Nam even back then.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.040
I just wanted a friend.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.440
When I was a kid, I didn't have anyone.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.000
Mr. Nam and I were the same age,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.760
in the same class,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.440
living under the same roof, so…

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.360
I wanted to be friends with him.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.960
If back then,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.200
Nam had agreed to be your friend,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.600
things might've turned out differently.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.320
But we can't turn back time.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.720
So…

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.800
I stopped thinking about that long ago.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.440
Recognize this room?

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.160
Yes.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.040
It was my bedroom.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.760
You're stunned by nostalgia, huh?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.480
Come on.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.280
Hello.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.000
Heard the car ages ago, but you two
took forever. What were you doing?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.560
Just showing her around,
a little memory tour.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.560
Good.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.440
Now she'll know what's where,
and more importantly,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.360
who's who.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.600
When will you deal with this?

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.160
Next week.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.760
Aren't you going to tell me
what you two were just talking about?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160
Well?

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.920
What's happening next week?

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.320
What are those two doing?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.640
A battle for the rice ladle, maybe.
Whoever scoops first gets the merit.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.920
Not quite.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.600
The elders say

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.080
between the bride and groom,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.520
whoever holds their ladle higher

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.440
will be the one who leads.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760
Folks,

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.240
I suggest you both hold the ladle together

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.760
and scoop at the same time.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.120
That way, no one's above the other.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.640
Otherwise, I might never
get back to the temple today.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.120
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE RECORD

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.200
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.360
All set, sir?

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.920
All good.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.120
Tell the driver to take
the director back to his office.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.040
Yes, Mr. Din.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.880
-I'll take my leave.
-Thank you.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.960
Goodbye.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.640
That's it for me. I'm heading out.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.040
Uh…

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.680
Um…

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.600
Let your uncle… Oh, wait.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.760
I shouldn't call myself "uncle".

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.240
Let your father take this role for you.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.920
May you both

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.920
have a blessed marriage,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.880
a life filled
with good fortune and harmony.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.120
Just seeing their faces drives me crazy.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.480
Now I have to live
under the same roof as them.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.040
Dreaming of auspicious things

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.720
must be a sign something good is coming.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.760
Here, Dad.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.240
What is he doing?

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.560
It's called the "bed-setting ceremony".

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.960
It blesses the newlyweds, so they'll
stay together for a long, long time.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.600
Though this isn't the full version,
the real one has way too many props.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.240
Come.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.680
May you both

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.000
live happily together.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.040
And don't be stubborn, don't argue,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.560
don't give your husband such a hard time.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.440
Dad, I'm your daughter!

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.080
Din…

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.840
You're now my son too.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.040
Take good care of her for me.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.480
Whatever happens,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.600
talk it out.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.120
Yes.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.400
If Tesho

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.720
and your mother were still here,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.680
they'd be so happy right now.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.520
What are you doing?

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.040
I'm packing to sleep in another room.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.040
No.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.880
We agreed we'd sleep separately.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.800
-Move.
-No.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.080
What? Why not?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.280
Even if we're married on paper
and you've moved in,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.000
right now,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.440
Nam is watching us closely.
You can't make him suspicious.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.360
Meaning…

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.840
No way.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.080
There's no way I'm sleeping
in the same room as you.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.760
If you have another option, say it.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.280
I don't.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.760
But a promise is a promise.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.720
You're breaking your word on day one?

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.160
I promised not to cross any lines.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.400
Sharing a room doesn't mean I will.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.440
But I don't trust you.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.520
You're still staying.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.960
I won't let you ruin my plan.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.080
Nina!

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.720
Nina!

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.200
-Fabulous, babe.
-Long time no see.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.320
How are you?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.760
I'm good. Did you wait long?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.360
Not at all. What can I get you today?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.200
Same as always.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.680
Coming right up.
Tonight we're going all out.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.600
We're not going home sober!

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.640
-For our gorgeous lady, here you go.
-Thank you!

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.960
Be right back, girls.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.440
Where are you going?

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.160
You just got here.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.680
I found a man.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.600
Oh my God.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.520
If you don't want company, just say it.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.560
No need to chase me away.
No need to leave.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.800
I have pride too, you know.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.160
How strange.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.680
I've never seen you drink alone like this.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.480
Drop the act.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.840
You know what happened.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.560
Not drinking would be strange.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.480
Want to vent to me?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.960
I promise

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.360
I'll be a very good listener.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.280
I don't believe
Din and Ms. Sarah love each other.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.440
There has to be more to it.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.160
Think about it, Nina.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.359
They signed the marriage papers,

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.000
had the ceremony at home today,

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:11.359
And from now on,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.359
I have to look at the woman I love
as my sister-in-law.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.520
-Damn you, Din! You jerk!
-Careful.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.000
You suck! You selfish bastard!

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.480
Watch your step. Slowly. Careful.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.480
Careful. One step at a time.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.440
You can yell in the car later, okay?

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.640
Watch your step. Careful.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.760
No, no, I can get in the car myself.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.120
Alright.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.680
Get in then. No! Watch your head.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.280
Easy. Watch your head.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.520
I'm exhausted.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.440
You don't love me? Fine.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.600
But marrying my brother?

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.680
Seriously?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.760
Sarah…

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.680
Sarah!

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.640
Seat belt, please.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.680
Tonight…
I'll make you forget all about it.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.920
Hey, hey!

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.840
Go that way! That way!

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.840
Out! Go!

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.240
Killed the mood!

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.920
Hey! Mr. Din!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.360
What are you doing? I'm not playing.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.000
Do you really think

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.400
those pillows and blankets

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.000
will actually keep me away?

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.640
If I wanted to do anything to you,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.760
I would've done it long ago.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.720
There!

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.600
Stop being ridiculous
and go to sleep already.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.280
Hey, hey, what are you doing now?

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.000
Don't follow me.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.520
Sarah…

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.880
Fine. A little uncomfortable,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.720
but at least it's safe.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.240
Hey.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.440
Hey, come out.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.880
I was teasing you.
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.640
I don't believe you.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.680
You're sleeping in the bathroom.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.120
That's uncomfortable.
Can you even sleep like that?

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.160
And what if I want to use the bathroom?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.520
Then use another one. Your house is huge.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.440
If you want to make your life hard,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.360
suit yourself.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.640
What am I even doing here?

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.600
I wanna cry.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.920
I should be the one apologizing
for coming so late.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.920
Here's this month's interest, as agreed.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.120
And I have good news.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.520
About Din's wedding?

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.200
Oh, you already know?

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.800
Let's just say I've removed
that thorn from your heart.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.040
I'd like to invite Mr. Praphop
to invest in the project--

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.440
Din's wedding is one thing.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.000
Investment is another.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.000
But Nina…

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.920
You could talk to your father
for me, like always.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.960
If you want me to beg Father,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.160
shouldn't I at least be
somewhat certain of a few things?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.920
If he invests,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.560
and I get nothing in return,

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.440
I'd be at a huge disadvantage.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.840
Hm…

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.280
I've done everything I can on my end.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.160
Beyond that,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.840
I'm powerless to control Nam.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.160
Then, I guess

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.560
you already have your answer.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.440
I won't be sending you off, okay?

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.240
Ow…

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.240
Ugh.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.480
My whole body aches.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.040
Hey, hey, what?!

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.840
You jerk! You bastard!

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.560
-You liar!
-Hey, wait!

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.200
Wait, stop! Slow down!

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.880
Think.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.280
You got into the bed yourself.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.440
I built the Great Wall between us.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.640
You're the one who took advantage.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.280
You molested--

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.120
When I woke up,

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.800
you were hugging me on the bed.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.720
I tried to pull your hands off,
but you wouldn't let go.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.960
And you wrapped your leg around me,
so I couldn't even move.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.560
I had to let you cling to me all night
until my whole body's sore.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.120
You…

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.880
You're serious?

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.320
Hey. Can you check my rib here?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.200
What happened?

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.200
I don't know. It just hurts.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.200
Not sure if it's cracked or bruised.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.560
What did you bump into?

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.720
Feels like…

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.600
a massive, heavy leg was crushing me.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.320
Hey, watch your mouth.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.040
My legs are slim and tiny.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.680
Pretty sure what I remember
was thick and heavy.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.080
Thick and heavy, huh?

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.720
Ouch, hey! That hurts!

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.200
That's what you get for talking trash.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.200
You're body-shaming, you know.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.800
Okay, okay, I was joking.
I won't say it again.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.120
Nam, get up.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.600
Get up right now, Nam.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.600
Nam. Up.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.880
Why are you sleeping down here?

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.520
Nam. Ugh, you reek of alcohol.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.400
Did you drink it or bathe in it?

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.560
-Nam, you can't sleep here, honey.
-Mom.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.400
-Let me help.
-Yeah, okay.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.120
Nam.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.320
Nam.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.920
Nam.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.160
-Get up.
-Here, I'll help.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.280
-Let go.
-Huh? Oh.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.080
-Nam.
-Nam… Hey.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.600
Oh dear! Nam!

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.920
Nam!

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.600
Oh dear. Nam.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.640
Slowly. Get up slowly.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.120
Come on. Let's go.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.480
Walk with me. Slowly now.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.440
Yes, that's it…

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.880
Straight ahead… Slowly…

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.040
I told you this wouldn't work.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.400
See? Mr. Nam's even worse now.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.120
I thought he was just obsessed
with you and he'd get over it.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.440
Who knew he'd fall apart like this?

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.920
You think you understand your brother,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.560
but the truth is,

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.520
you've never understood him at all.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.760
Fine. I admit it.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.240
But even if I understand, I won't give…

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.720
Give what?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.240
Mr. Din, we have a big issue.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.120
So, this is your wife, Din?

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.840
Sorry I didn't send a gift
for the wedding.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.880
It's completely fine.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.040
It was just a small ceremony.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.040
So pretty…

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.280
Just like Nina described.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.280
Thank you very much, sir.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.760
Call us Uncle and Aunt.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.400
We're no strangers anymore, right?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.480
Thank you.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.600
I'll head back to work then.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.520
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, dear.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.720
For you to come see me yourself,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.840
this must be important, Uncle.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.720
Well, you could say that.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.960
It's been quite some time already.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.760
I'd like to have my principal back.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.480
My mom gave you
the interest yesterday, didn't she?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.160
We don't want

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.920
just the interest anymore.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.280
We want the principal back.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.360
I have several investments lined up.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.680
I thought it's more worthwhile
to get my money back

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.880
than to keep waiting
for interest from you.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.800
You understand, right?

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.320
I understand.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.760
But right now, my company

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.200
still needs working capital.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.160
If I return the money now,
I'll lose liquidity.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.560
Uncle…

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.360
Could you give me a little more time?

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.520
Uh…

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.680
Then how about this?

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.120
If I ask for a seat on the board,

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.440
what will you say, Din?

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.240
Uh…

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.600
What do you mean, Uncle?
I'm not really following.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.720
I simply want to help manage the company.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.560
If the company makes more profit,

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.160
you'll be able to pay me back faster.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.080
Alright.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.600
But…

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.600
wouldn't a board committee role
be too small for you, Uncle?

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.440
It's not for me.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.840
I'm busy with politics. I won't have time.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.240
Then…

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.280
who do you want on the board?

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.880
Someone I trust.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.480
If it's anyone else, I won't complain.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.720
But I'm never working
with someone like Chakrit.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.280
Why not?

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.680
Even though Chakrit

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.960
doesn't have management experience,

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.840
he's no ordinary kid.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.680
He's one of the rising stars
in business right now.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.480
He doesn't have
PD's best interests at heart.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.480
And the reason I'm in debt

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.720
and needed your money,
part of it came from his father.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.400
Din, you need to separate business
from personal matters.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.320
I think

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.040
Chakrit is professional enough.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.680
He won't harm the company.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.560
And besides,
he owns this company's shares.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.080
How could he not wish the company well?

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.920
Please, this way.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.440
This will be your office, Mr. Chakrit.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.280
If you need anything else,
please let me know.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.800
Hey, wait.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960
Come here.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.840
Who are you calling?

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.120
You. Come here.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.360
I don't like this room.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.679
I want… a bigger one.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.040
A corner office

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.560
would be even better.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.600
I want a view that's easy on the eyes.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.880
If you want a new office, sir,
it'll take two or three days to prepare.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.640
I want it now.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.800
Father, why would you do this?

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.560
Now it'll be even harder
for me and Nam to get along.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.720
Why didn't you talk to me first?

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.000
Still hoping?

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.720
If he wanted you,
he would've chosen you a long time ago.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.200
Stop obsessing over men

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.280
and start thinking
about your own benefits.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.520
I don't dislike Nam.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.440
He's a good kid.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.400
But I don't have the luxury
to wait for him for years like you do.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.200
None of you understand me.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.080
I like Nam.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.360
I like that he's the only guy
who ever rejected me.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.200
Honestly,

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.720
I don't want to lose to someone like that.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.720
I want him at my feet.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.920
But he doesn't care
about the company at all.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.040
We've pressured him in every way,
and he still doesn't care.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.280
You want us to take losses

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.920
and get nothing back?

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.120
PD is actually a solid company.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.920
It just has cashflow problems.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.080
If we inject some money
and get liquidity back,

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.040
I think it'll recover for sure.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.400
And all the benefits

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.960
will go back to you.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.120
Whatever you two decide.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.720
Chakrit, I'm counting on you.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.200
Don't worry, sir.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.480
But please don't forget our deal.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.560
If I succeed,

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.480
I get Din's position.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.840
That depends on your ability.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.400
Uncle Perm, what's going on?

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.320
Mr. Chakrit ordered
the whole staff to be fired.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.000
He fired the staff?

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.640
This is your management?

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.680
No wonder the company would collapse.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.320
Why not try again?
Prove yourself to Ms. Sarah.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.360
Show her you have value.
Show her you can protect her.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.600
I want to know.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.360
If this project gets launched

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.080
and ends up being a loss,

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.040
who exactly will take responsibility?

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.040
I'll resign as CEO.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.240
