Characters, actions, places, occupations,

and events in this series are fictional and

Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.850
Do you like me?

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.400
What?

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.100
Those that start off like this

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.010
always end up together,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.200
together,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.960
together.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.500
Stop it!

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.020
I want to see him again.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.200
This is probably the first time
that you’ve been ditched.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.450
What do I have to do?

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.590
You just have to get him at all costs.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.550
Tell me who you are.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.560
Am I going to keep being
the target of harassment like this?

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.550
Why are you calling?

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.020
I’m worried about you.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.100
Ugh!

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.030
What’d you call me here for?

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.550
Something happened at the award event.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.400
What happened?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.850
Someone threw piss at me.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.970
What?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.900
Are you alright?

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.900
I’m completely fine.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.900
But I want you to wipe everything
that went online.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.750
When is something like this going to end?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.800
I don’t know.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.700
But you should prepare for
something even worse.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.500
I don’t understand you, you know?

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.350
You’re scared to get beat up,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.250
but both your work
and your source of income

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.460
are exactly why people
want to beat you up.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.200
You know that?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.100
If I’m getting killed
or made to disappear,

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.050
I need to say something to you:

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.150
Bye-bye.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.900
Jerk.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.250
Here.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.300
Wipe it for me.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.500
I don’t want people thinking that’s me.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.750
Things will only get worse from there.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.240
(Bullshit!)

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880
(You’re all talk!)

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.200
(You promise beautiful things
but you can’t keep your own word.)

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.670
I’ll have it wiped.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.260
I’m counting on you.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.770
Yeah?

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.770
Hey.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.130
I saw the video.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.900
Are you… alright?

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.500
It’s been a shit day.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.020
You busy?

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.440
Meet me at Burnout.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.570
Uhh…

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.200
I’m really busy with work right now.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.970
It will probably take an hour or so.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.830
Is that okay?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.200
Yeah. I’ll wait for you there.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.310
Meet me soon.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.730
Of course.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.340
Hello.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.750
You’re here late today.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.200
It’s been a really bad day.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.100
Can you…

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.100
Can you smell me?

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.300
I don’t feel very confident.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.710
What?

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.730
Come on.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.560
Smell me.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.700
Did you smell anything?

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.500
Wow.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.500
Do I smell bad?

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.300
I could tell you just showered.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.280
But I also smelled…

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.600
Pee?

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.800
How’d you know that?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.850
Does it still smell so strongly?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.500
Well, I’ve been there.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.550
When I was in high school,

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.980
there was the school’s
football competition.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.750
When things got intense,

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.300
the students threw piss and shit
across the bleachers.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.670
I had to take a bus home.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.900
It wouldn’t wash off no matter what.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.800
What should I do?

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.980
Crap.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.150
What are you doing out here this late?

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.770
How’d you know I’m here?

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.250
Did you track my phone?

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.600
As specified in the contract.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.400
Let’s talk inside.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.370
Come on.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.370
Let go!

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.500
Here.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.400
For you.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.650
For what?

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.650
Do you like it?

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.900
Are you trying to make up?

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.850
A rose.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.100
Thoughtless.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.850
Is that all you could come up with?

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.140
I saw them in the drawing.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.300
Those are tulips.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.800
Oh.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.670
Well, then…

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.500
I’m giving it to you anyway.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.800
You can do whatever you want with it.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.200
But you’re sleeping with me tonight.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.050
The audacity.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.800
If you don’t come with me, there’s no way
I’m getting any sleep tonight.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.620
I’ll be too worried about you.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.400
Ugh!

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.100
I don’t need your worry.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.350
It’s even more worrisome
to be around you, actually.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.250
You’re still mad at me?

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.230
Alright.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.130
I’ll give you one chance only.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.200
You can scold me, insult me, or whatever.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.500
Just let it all out.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.330
I promise to not get mad.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.100
I can say anything?

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.000
Yeah.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.500
Isn’t that the gimmick here?

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.100
Are you sure you can take it?

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.300
Umm.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.900
You’re lucky
I don’t need to piss right now.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.250
You feel better now?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:12.950
No.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.230
And I’m not going home with you.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:46.800
Hello.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.150
Red wine.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.500
I saw that it’s all on your face now,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.650
so I thought you might
want to have a taste of it.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.900
It’s a really good wine.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.470
Thank you.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.100
Are you closing?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:02.870
Yes.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.100
But would you like to rant?

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.210
You’re already at Burnout Bar, after all.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.150
I probably won’t be able to sleep tonight.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.900
There was some problem at work.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.050
I thought I was being thorough
about my plans.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.950
But I got him in trouble anyway.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.950
And I feel bad that he refused
to come home with me tonight.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:31.900
I don’t know.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.850
When he’s not where I can see him,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.600
I just keep thinking anything
can happen to him.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.680
Ugh.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.800
I don’t like myself right now.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.900
Sorry.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.600
Did I confuse you?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.300
Totally.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.400
But I kind of understand.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.100
People who come here
have all sorts of problems.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.100
For most men,

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.800
when they realize they did something bad,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.450
they’d overlook it and hope to make up
the next time around.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.330
You can say they…

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:06.550
play dumb.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:07.980
But in my opinion,

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.700
I don’t think that’ll work.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.000
You need to lay yourself bare
in front of him

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.650
and explain to him
what you just explained to me.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.900
I think he will, a hundred percent,
forgive you.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.600
Mawin, you jerk!

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.120
Come out here!

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.830
You bastard.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.560
What you banging on my door for?

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.500
Huh?

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.300
It’s five in the morning.
You’re home late.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.500
I’ve been trying to
wipe the videos you were in.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.700
I searched the whole internet for them.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.630
Do you know how long it took me

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.800
to employ the software
that could block all the sources?

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.900
And I have to keep monitoring it!

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.400
Oh, yeah?

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.490
My bad.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.730
Doesn’t he freaking deserve it?

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.700
He can’t keep laying people off!

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.300
I’ll tell you what, that was
hardly enough for the likes of him.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:25.900
Asshole.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.800
I talked to him!

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.450
Koh and I are trying to find
another way to cut costs.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.980
But nothing’s been finalized yet
so I haven’t told you.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.200
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.620
And one more thing,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.900
the guy you threw piss at wasn’t Koh.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.450
He’s my guy!

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.300
He works as Koh’s representative.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.620
Crap.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.430
Oh, shit.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.410
Can I call your guy and apologize?

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.420
Jerk, don’t.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.500
It’s 5 in the morning.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.500
Just go back to bed.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.250
-But let me just…
-Ow!

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.950
Why are you hitting me?

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:05.990
You jerk!

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:24.300
What?

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.700
Wow.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.700
Your survival instinct is high, you know?

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.400
From now on,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.200
I’m only watering you guys occasionally.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.240
I hope to see you in bloom again.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:48.900
Hello.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.050
Hello.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.150
How are you feeling?

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.400
I’m sorry I couldn’t see you last night.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.600
It’s alright.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.100
I’m okay now.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:57.400
I see.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.300
Do you want to meet today?

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.100
I’ll bring food.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.100
It’s okay.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.850
I already ate.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.010
I’m planning to draw you to feel better.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.390
Okay.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.600
You should get to your drawing.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.700
I won’t bother you.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:14.600
(Okay.)

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.500
(I’ll show it to you as soon as I’m done.)

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.600
Okay.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.350
See you.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.150
What?

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.200
Why’d you hang up?

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.570
I haven’t gotten the chance to apologize.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.020
Call him right now.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.430
The matter between me and him
is more important.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.070
Keep your matter for later.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.200
Later, huh?

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.110
Wow.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:42.890
Wow.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.320
Jerk.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.400
You wouldn’t let me clear up my matter.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.600
And you’re too chicken
to do anything about yours.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.000
Why did you let him get away so easily?

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.250
You didn’t even insist.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.830
What if I annoy him?

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:56.800
Oh.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.050
How’d that thought get into your head?

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.600
What happened to the bad boy I know?

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.800
Go to him right now.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.600
Imagine this.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.500
He got washed in some
random bastard’s piss,

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.600
and then someone offered
to take care of him.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.800
Anyone would like that, right?

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.190
The timing is right.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:17.850
Oh, damn it.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.600
Why are you calling?

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.180
You feel better?

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:51.300
(No.)

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.210
Did someone follow you after you left?

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.330
Just you.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.050
Pestering me with phone calls.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.090
Are you a stalker?

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.140
I’m just worried for your safety.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:01.550
You know what,

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.250
since you don’t feel better,
why don’t you come stay with me?

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.600
I’ll send a car.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.600
No.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.300
Stop calling me. I need some rest.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:47.710
What?

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.190
What are you— Hey!

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.500
Who let you in?

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.300
Get out of here.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:51.940
Hey!

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.660
I told you to get out.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:54.410
Hey!

00:16:59.220 --> 00:16:59.840
Hold on.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.500
Will you calm down?

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.300
I feel assured now that I see you’re safe.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.010
But I couldn’t sleep last night.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.500
I’m so sleepy.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.300
You really gonna make me drive right now?

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.599
You made it here in one piece,

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.310
I’m sure you can do it again.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.569
I’m really at my limit right now.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.900
Let me take a rest for a little bit.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.099
Once I feel better, I’ll go.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.180
Hey, no!

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.860
Get up!

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.710
You can’t sleep here.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.230
Get up!

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:31.920
Get up right now.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.450
Up.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:36.900
How annoying.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.100
Here.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.300
Drink some water.
Maybe you’ll feel better.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.070
You said you didn’t like roses.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.170
How come you have so many of them?

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.500
They’re not my favorite.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.150
They just happened to bloom all
at the same time.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.430
Did you finish that drawing of me
from the other day?

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.020
Yeah.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.000
When you were sleeping on
a pile of laundry,

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.050
it made me realize you’re just a man,

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.500
a harmless man.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.450
I forgot who you are,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.300
what your social status is,

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.800
or how much money you have.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.950
In that moment, you were just you.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.050
What? Are you crying?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.450
What about this?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.650
At first, I was going to draw
just you laying there.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.900
But when you asked me what happened next,

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.900
I drew an angel,

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.670
flying close

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.910
to tuck you in

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.500
and kiss you.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.750
Are you the angel?

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.700
Do you want to kiss me in my sleep?

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.100
I drew you dead.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.070
Who’d want to kiss a dead man?

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.090
How many times have you wished me dead?

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.600
That wasn’t my intention.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.330
But the inspiration for this composition
came from a painting called

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.120
“Equality Before Death.”

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.350
It was made by a French painter
in the 19th century.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.600
How much will you sell me this drawing?

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.800
Is the same price okay?

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.570
I want to double it
since there are two figures.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.250
Are you jacking up the price?

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.500
Take it or leave it.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.250
Fine.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.320
What?

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.600
Are you sleeping?

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.870
You like drawing me sleep, right?

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.950
Draw me right now.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.200
No.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.900
It’s my rest day.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.350
Let me just sleep here.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.200
Get up right now.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:52.650
Hey.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:58.770
Hey.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.950
Wake up.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:04.600
Hey.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.200
You’re pretending, right?

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.100
Is this how you wanna do it?

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.980
Hey!

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.550
Wake up!

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:21.400
What the hell?

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.550
He’s really sleeping?

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.150
Oh?

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.950
What are you doing here?

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.500
I came here because
I was worried about you.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.350
I didn’t think you’d be busy.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:22.710
Wait, wait, wait.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:23.900
Let me explain.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.900
Stop.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.400
Explain what?

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.100
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.900
Wait. Stop it.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.300
Say what you have to say.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.720
I really did want to rest today.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.010
Koh just showed up unannounced.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.730
I couldn’t say no.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:47.830
So it was nothing.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.050
Hey.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.400
If it was nothing,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.250
why are you walking away?

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.200
Just talk to me.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:57.980
Listen to me.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.750
Right now, my head is full of questions.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.500
And the biggest question is if he and you…

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.600
There’s nothing going on
between you two, is there?

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.030
No.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.020
It’s just work.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.010
Are you upset and walking away

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.070
because you’re jealous?

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.450
Yes, I am.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.650
You okay with that?

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:49.850
Of course.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.950
I like it.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.200
You busy this Saturday?

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.250
I want to show you my friend’s gallery.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.610
I want to draw you, too.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.900
Would you call that…

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:13.510
a date?

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:17.500
Yeah.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:43.700
Here.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.900
The wine-stained shirt.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.400
I painted it.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:48.950
I got it done for a while now.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.780
I hope you like it.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.870
I’ll walk you out.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:11.980
Hey, hey, hey.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.100
No photos.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.050
It’s just a sketch.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.500
Where did you go?

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.430
I was out stretching.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.700
I was supposed to get my rest today.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.600
Instead, I’m drawing you.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.000
It’s good, isn’t it?

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.300
I like your place.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.800
It’s a good place to sleep.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.650
Now that I got some sleep, I feel better.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.950
I’m sorry.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.250
I may have been a little paranoid,

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:42.550
but I hope you can forgive me.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.650
I’ll come see you more often.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.300
Please.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:52.950
If you come here again, I’m moving out.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:54.810
Alright, alright.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.750
I’ll leave you alone.

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.850
I got my sleep. You got your art.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.530
We’re all happy.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.650
If you say so.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.150
Dude.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.100
What the hell is that shirt?

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.970
It’s a wine-stained shirt.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.020
I’m gonna be honest.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:41.850
Is it good?

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:44.150
You bastard.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.300
You don’t have the eyes for it.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.900
It’s art.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.980
And he made it for me.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.470
I have a meeting in five minutes.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.250
Why don’t you go and be silent
in the other room?

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.100
Is it with Koh?

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.030
Umm.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.650
I… want to resign.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.270
Can you, like, pretend to fire me?

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.300
So I at least get the severance pay.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.550
What are you saying?

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.550
I’m just disgusted by what Koh said,

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.700
at the event, about AI.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.800
There will be more than ten thousand
people who lose their jobs.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.610
Even if Koh didn’t do it,
someone else will.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.130
Wow.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.600
You’re so protective of him, huh?

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.170
I think you have Stockholm syndrome, dude.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:32.700
What’s that?

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.800
Look at you.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.000
Don’t you seem to like someone
who oppresses you?

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.200
You’re so obsessed with your comfort zone
that you’ll do anything.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.650
I’m not obsessed with my comfort zone.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.130
Fine. Whatever.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.830
Let me be honest.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.200
Are you gonna make it?

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.400
I am.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:10.050
I’ll prove to you that life
does find a way.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.980
Maybe that’ll help enlighten you
and make you quit, too.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.800
(Hey, Koh. Can you hear me?)

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.850
What’s on the agenda today?

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:22.020
(Nothing much.)

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.710
The R&D department is going to
your place next week.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.390
Okay?

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.690
What the hell’s on your shirt?

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.300
You don’t like it?

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.900
It’s fashion.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.200
It’s a wine-stained shirt.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.250
What the hell kind of fashion is that?

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.860
Wow.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.850
You look especially amazing today.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.200
Do you like the shirt?

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:16.830
Well…

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.970
There’s nothing not to like.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.950
I’ll show you around today.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.800
-Uh-huh.
-Let’s go.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.370
Give me your bag.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:31.800
I’ll carry it.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.770
Is your hand also heavy?

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:42.830
Can I carry it?

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.200
What do you think?

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.200
I actually like his work.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.430
I like that he uses flowers
to represent diversity in our society.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:15.100
This painting, for example,

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:19.500
when I look at it, I’m reminded of
my childhood home.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.620
It’s like staring at objects
strewn with memories.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.100
Don’t you know a lot about it?

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.600
Did you look it up?

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:32.030
No.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.870
I love art.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.670
Look at this.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:42.800
I got a tattoo.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.600
Guess whose style it is.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:50.900
Miró?

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:51.700
Correct.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.400
I got another tattoo
elsewhere as well, though.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.400
You wanna see it?

00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:59.500
Show me.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.310
Not now.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.330
We gotta find a more discreet place.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:09.840
Hey.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:10.699
Oh?

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.370
I didn’t know you’d be here.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:13.909
Of course I would.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:17.900
Are you Pheem?

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.050
Yes.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.350
This is Ing.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.500
You can say she’s my manager,

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.400
since she manages everything in my life.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:26.500
She curated this exhibition.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:27.730
I’m Ing.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.400
Nice to meet you.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.699
Actually, this curator job is
just a passion of mine.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:34.670
I’m actually a casting director.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.550
You interested in sending in your CV?

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:40.600
I think I can find something for you.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.500
No way.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.550
I don’t think I can act.

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:47.800
I do have a friend
who’s interested, though.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.010
Really?

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:50.900
What’s your friend like?

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.449
He’s… more handsome than I am.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:55.980
He is?

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.000
That’s good.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:59.670
Would you mind giving me your contact?

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.590
Of course.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:01.600
Hey.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.600
That’s enough.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.100
You jealous?

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:12.830
Feel free to roam around taking a look.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.210
Let me talk to my friend for a minute.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.150
Here.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:16.900
Thank you.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.930
You bitch, why’d you pull me away?

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.030
You want to draw him, don’t you?

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:29.270
Yeah.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.400
Why don’t you go to the table
at the back of the gallery?

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.200
It’s quiet and private.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.900
The light should be perfect right now.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.000
I still haven’t come up with
how I’d draw him.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.600
That’s why we’ve been looking around.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.770
He’s handsome, I’ll admit that.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.500
He’s your type.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:48.850
Know-it-all.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.770
Someone as gorgeous as him…

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.700
I bet you don’t just want him
to be your muse.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.900
It’s more like you want to see him naked.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.750
Don’t make art your excuse.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:12.900
Mr. Koh.

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.200
I’m afraid this is the best I could do
to wash the wine stain.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:31.530
It’s alright.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:52.770
Okay.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.480
Just imagine I’m not here.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.420
Don’t think about posing.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:36:59.900
Be normal.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.500
But you’re here.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.400
That’s why I said imagine it.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.300
Okay.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.250
What are you staring at?

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.100
I told you to imagine I’m not here.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.300
Okay.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.820
What are you doing?

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.020
For you.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.900
How often do you do that to people?

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:02.800
No.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.600
I just thought you’d look beautiful
with those flowers.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.150
Stop staring.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.250
-Okay. I know.
-I’m gonna keep drawing.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.010
What happened? Why don’t you continue?

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:49.950
I’m just thinking I enjoy it more
when I’m talking to you.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.370
More than drawing you, that is.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.000
Okay.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.600
Let’s talk, then.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.270
I’m not rushing you anyway.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.550
Let’s call it off for now, then.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.000
What should we do next?

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:22.200
Give me your hand.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.700
This line indicates your current affairs.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.850
How so?

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:40.400
It says if you can’t draw me
here right now,

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.150
maybe we can move to your place instead.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:20.850
Hello, Mr. Red Wine.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:22.650
Are you burnt out?

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.510
Do you want me to find you a partner?

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:26.400
No need.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.470
Just give me a drink.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.410
Coming up.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:45.700
Here.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.250
Hidden Agenda.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.600
A drink for someone
with an ulterior motive.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.600
I’m beginning to like this bar.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.700
Do my friends come here often?

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.300
Jira, you mean?

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.600
He just started frequenting the place.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:11.700
And Pheem?

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.030
Hey.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.900
Isn’t it tiring walking up
the stairs every day?

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.010
Of course.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.500
But we’re here.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.770
If it is, then why not move out?

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.750
You can move in with me.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:35.900
I’m tired.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:37.770
I can’t go inside.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.300
You’re tired?

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.100
Need my help?

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.700
Koh’s calling me.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.200
You gonna take it?

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:23.800
This is no time for it.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:25.500
Forget him.

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.260
(Welcome to voicemail service.)

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.200
Just forget him.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.500
But I never ignored his calls.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.700
Maybe this is important.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.090
Try it.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.930
There’s a first time for everything.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.300
Let me keep it.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.070
I want to know if you’re okay
about last night.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:24.950
I want to know you more intimately.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.810
Don’t we know each other already?

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.700
I think you’re trying too hard.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.900
How long do I have to play the villain?

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.200
It’s exhausting.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.300
You promised you’d do anything.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.850
Someone like you

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.100
likes someone awful.

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:42.200
A jerk, a bad boy, a prick,

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.400
like Koh.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.550
Are you laying down for me to sketch you?

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:48.170
How else do I get you in the mood?
